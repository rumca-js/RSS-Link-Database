# Overview

Rss links database.

Captured using Django application: [https://github.com/rumca-js/Django-rss-feed](https://github.com/rumca-js/Django-rss-feed).

# Data

 - RSS links are captured for each source separately
 - two files are created for each source each day: JSON and markdown
 - markdown file is generated as a form of preview, JSON can be reused, imported

# Goal

 - Archive purposes
 - Google sucks at providing results for various topics (dead internet)
 - Data analysis

# Problems

 - Google fails to connect people (blogs etc.) which could have killed private hosting, or impacted it significantly. Only corporate hosting lives ... and yet currently information from corporate entities are captured
 - We cannot capture data from anyone, as many people can create and abandon their web pages
 - Link rot is real, archived links will not work in a year time. For reddit link can be removed after several minutes
 - Is the data relevant, or useful for anyone?
 - Either we would like to record data from 'well established sources' or gather as many links as possible. I think web engines do it? We cannot gather too much data, as it can destroy our potato servers.

# Ending notes

All links belong to us!
