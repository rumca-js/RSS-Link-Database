<item><title>![CDATA[Tell HN: Google Maps location data is used for GeoIP updates]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Hi,<p>I've been meaning to write this for a few years now.
I saw https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34032484 and lots of great replies there - but I happen to have an insight which I kept track of for years now.<p>Some background first. Since more than a decade I've been using an always-on VPN on all my devices through a VPS I operate (various cloud providers along the years).
Also for context, I stopped using all google services around 2015 or thereabouts - although I still have an account I no longer use it.
The only google service that I use rarely is google maps - of course, never logged on.
And a few times a month I use google search for the odd obscure thing.<p>Around 2016 was the first time I noticed that google.com was showing at the bottom of the page my ZIP code. It felt very unusual but I was in the process of moving so I didn't pay too much attention. To my surprise, a few weeks later google.com was showing my new ZIP code.<p>I shopped around for cloud providers that would allow me to rotate the instance IP easily and thankfully there are many but I was curious how come google picked it up - the only plausible reason was using location data from the Google Maps iOS app.<p>Here's how you can replicate this.<p>Get a cheap VPS from a country different than yours. Get an iOS device (ideally an (older?) iPhone but I think it should work on an iPad) - Android devices should be excluded from this test for obvious reasons.
Reset it to factory defaults (optional but removes moving parts and false leads like cookies etc).<p>Install wireguard (or your preferred always-on vpn) and configure the VPS to be used as an exit node.
Install google maps (don't login of course) - can be used without being logged on just fine.
Install firefox focus (Safari in Private Window mode would work as well).<p>Confirm via ipinfo (or your preferred whatsmyip website) that you're using the VPS IP
Go to google.com and confirm it's showing at the bottom of the page the country of the VPS (could also be shown in a different language if google has a presence in that country).<p>Use the google maps app a few times a day (ideally navigate from a place to another) - it will take about 2-3 weeks but you'll notice that google.com will now show your actual country for the VPS IP and also the google.com language will change to your own.<p>If you want to take it one step further, continue to use google maps on the iOS device. You'll notice that after a few more weeks, google.com will show your actual City (based on the IP) - and after a while longer it will be even more precise, will show your ZIP code.<p>You have to be patient though, it will take 2-4 weeks to start with - and it's imperative that that IP address is dedicated to this test.<p>Funny enough, I was on holiday on Mexico for a month right before reading the HN article I mentioned (have been using a VPS in the states for lower latency) and I noticed that after 2 weeks the language changed to Spanish and google.com was showing Mexico (I rotated the IP when this happened and it prompted me to write this 'Tell HN'.<p>Not surprisingly but Google doesn't share the new GeoIP data - MaxMind, ipinfo and others never changed their location data for that IP - they showed the original geoip even a few weeks after google changed theirs - haven't checked longer than that - it could be shared eventually.<p>In conclusion - I can't say that I'm surprised Google is using the Maps location data - and I don't think there's any way to prevent it (outside of not running Maps - but unfortunately it's one of the few ways of checking restaurant reviews).
My "workaround" is to periodically rotate my VPS IP and move on with life :)<p>Thanks for reading - I hope you found this useful.</p>

I almost made it, and once I started it was easier than I thought</p><p>The digital age is changing us in ways we would never expect. If you had told me 20 years ago that I would one day stop reading books, I would have said you were crazy. I’ve always been a reader; from the time I was little, I would hide away somewhere with a book and devour it, often in one sitting. Cut to 2021, when I realized I had only read five books that year, and the previous year, only eight.</p><p>I didn’t have to wonder why. I already knew it was my phone. We see our phone’s own calculation of how many hours we’ve spent on it each day, and we can’t quite believe it. <em>What?</em> Hours, I realized, that I used to spend reading books. So I made a New Year’s resolution for 2022: more books, less phone. I set a goal for myself of fifty books.

  <p id="8sP0jc">WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg says the <em>New York Post</em>’s<em> </em>2020 story on Hunter Biden forced parent company Automattic to weigh difficult moderation questions for the WordPress VIP hosting service — although the company concluded it shouldn’t take any action on the story.</p>
<p id="uLTbNJ">In October 2020, the <em>Post </em>ran a report based on material it said came from an abandoned Biden laptop. Facebook and Twitter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515972/facebook-new-york-post-hunter-biden-story-fact-checking-reduced-distribution-election-misinformation">temporarily restricted links to the story</a> as questions about the provenance of the laptop’s content swirled: Facebook limited its spread under potential misinformation rules, while Twitter placed a more extreme ban on links to it, citing rules against posting hacked materials. (It had previously enforced those rules against <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301875/twitter-bans-blueleaks-ddosecrets-hacked-leaked-police-data-links">leaked police department...</a></p>

<item><title>![CDATA['Maybe because I'm from China...': Twitter shutting down Chinese employee's concerns over censorship says so much]]</title><description>![CDATA[<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=32332769&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C59%2C0%2C59" /><br /><br /><p>Twitter Files Part Five dropped on Monday. It looks at the two days when a "debate" was had amongst tweeps over permanently banning the President of the United States. The tl;dr of it all (<a href="https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1602364197194432515" target="_blank">even though you should</a>) is that a bunch of emotional hemophiliac Twitter employees who had wanted to ban Trump for years since -- he is literal Hitler literally -- shot their shot, and the brass at the bird app bent the knee. One lone employee from China said, "You know, I've seen this movie before... do not recommend."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="78656" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32332863&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>We already know <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-engineer-free-speech" target="_blank">Twitter's "commie as f*ck" employees don't believe in free speech</a>. However, one employee who is from communist China attempted to dissent during the company-wide Donald Trump is Over Party.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">7. There were dissenters inside Twitter. <br /><br />“Maybe because I am from China,” said one employee on January 7, “I deeply understand how censorship can destroy the public conversation.” <a href="https://t.co/LtonK0gfS3">pic.twitter.com/LtonK0gfS3</a><br />— Bari Weiss (@bariweiss) <a href="https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1602365655595962368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>Maybe because I am from China, I deeply understand how censorship can destroy public conversation.</blockquote><p>For an example of what the employee is talking about, please see: <em><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/china-protests-foreign-forces" target="_blank">Right the F*ck Now</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/china-protests" target="_blank">The Protests Happening in China</a></em>. Also, any <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/critical-race-theory-mom-chinese" target="_blank">person who has seen the left's preferred policies in IRL</a>. </p><p>While the commie-as-f*ck Twitter employees appreciated the input of the employee who has experienced it before, meh.</p><blockquote>I understand this fear, but I also think it’s important to understand that censorship by a government is very different than censorship of the government.</blockquote><p>The difference is when the government is being censored by an institution that has grown to be more powerful than most governments, it's worse.</p><blockquote>The first amendment in the U.S. exist specifically to prevent the government from silencing the people </blockquote><p>So, instead, the government works <em>with</em> a private company to silence the people on their behalf. That way, it's not "the government" silencing the people. It's a private company...filled with activist employees who agree with the government's political agenda. This started with the feds "asking" Twitter to censor a news story. It turned into the Biden Administration working with Twitter (and Facebook) directly.</p><p>The fact that a lone person from Communist China was the dissenter over a bunch of woke Americans is a little too on the nose.</p><p><p>

The Trump stuff isn't surprising to me. Activist Twitter employees hated Donald Trump. Yoel Roth is a giant jerkface. They wanted to ban Trump for years. J6 gave them an excuse to press the button. Nothing that wasn't expected. </p><p>It's J21 up until the day Musk finalized his Twitter purchase -- <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/10/31/social-media-disinformation-dhs/" target="_blank">where the administration was much more blatant about telling Big Tech companies what to do</a> -- that I want to see. The bulk of that revolves around Fauci, his definition of what "The Science" is, and how anyone who contradicted his definition of "The Science" was "visibility filtered." What were the direct conversations with Fauci, the CDC, and/or the Biden administration? </p><p>Anything we assumed was happening, the Twitter Files have so far confirmed was happening. Whether or not Musk's sudden digs at Anthony Fauci is a preview of what's to come or nothing more than Elon being a bored on a poop break, that's still to be determined.</p><p><p>

<item><title>![CDATA[The Great Climate Con | Alex Epstein | #312]]</title><description>![CDATA[Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Alex Epstein discuss the undeniable need for fossil fuels, the toxic underlying nihilism of the “climate concerned” left, the need for balance between conservation and human progress, and the unexplored worth of wild potential.

Alex Epstein is a philosopher and energy expert who argues that "human flourishing" should be the guiding principle of energy and environmental progress. He is the author of the new bestselling book Fossil Future: Why Global Human Flourishing Requires More Oil, Coal, and Natural Gas—Not Less. He is also the creator of EnergyTalkingPoints.com—a source of powerful, well-referenced talking points on energy, environmental, and climate issues.

<item><title>![CDATA[You are being LIED to about inflation (here's the REAL cause)]]</title><description>![CDATA[✉️ OUR NEWSLETTER: https://www.abundantia.co/
📚 OUR COURSE/MEMBERSHIP: http://jointheorder.co/

You are being lied to about inflation. In fact, you're being told two main lies: the first is how high inflation actually is. But the second is who is truly responsible for a large part of inflation happening.

When we hear about inflation, we're told that it's primarily caused by the simple economics of money in the system. More money is printed, resulting in dollars becoming devalued, resulting in stuff getting more expensive. And yes, this is definitely a part of the inflation equation. However, there's a part that's often missed that in many cases, causes prices around us to rise as well.

To put it simply, it's all about corporate greed. And the desire of many companies to use inflation as a cover story for rising prices, so they can line their pockets. It's only possible they can do this due to lack of competition, which is something we don't think we have in today's world.

I'd love to hear your thoughts below.

0:00 - The big lies about inflation
0:55 - LIE 1: How high inflation really is
3:00 - The main narrative around inflation
3:26 - LIE 2: What is causing inflation
5:17 - Why competition is a myth
6:59 - Concentration of corporate power

<item><title>![CDATA[How Kurzgesagt Cooks Propaganda For Billionaires]]</title><description>![CDATA[Kurzgesagt is not just a popular science outreach channel. It's a major tool for propaganda of their billionaire sponsors.
Support independent research and analysis by joining my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone 

Kurzgesagt received estimated $7 million from billionaire funds. This would be more money than Kurzgesagt received from their supporters on Patreon (estimated $3.5 million) in the entire history of the channel.

Kurzgesagt never was this small, independent, almost entirely viewer-funded channel. As soon as the studio incorporated, billionaires began lining up. They transformed the small Munich-based design studio with 5 employees into a multi-million-dollar media powerhouse with dozens of employees.

<item><title>![CDATA[Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Oracle will share the Pentagon's $9 billion cloud contract]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Over a year after shutting down its previous attempt at modernizing its IT infrastructure, the Department of Defense (DOD) has picked Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Oracle as its new cloud service providers. The Pentagon has <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3239378/department-of-defense-announces-joint-warfighting-cloud-capability-procurement/">awarded</a> the companies separate contracts for the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) project, and according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/pentagon-awards-9-bln-cloud-contracts-each-google-amazon-oracle-microsoft-2022-12-07/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, they will have a shared budget ceiling of $9 billion. This initiative is a successor to DOD's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/department-of-defense-cancels-jedi-contract-172009337.html">cancelled Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure</a> (JEDI) program that was supposed to connect its different divisions using a single cloud service provider.&nbsp;</p><p>If you'll recall, the department awarded Microsoft with the $10 billion JEDI contract in 2019. Shortly after that, though, Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-14-amazon-microsoft-jedi-contract-protest.html">challenged</a> Microsoft's victory in court, claiming that the evaluation process had &quot;clear deficiencies, errors and unmistakable bias.&quot; Amazon argued back then that the Pentagon's decision was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-09-amazon-jedi-lawsuit-trump-vendetta.html">based on</a> &quot;egregious errors&quot; and &quot;the result of improper pressure from President Donald J. Trump.&quot; The company accused the former President of launching &quot;repeated public and behind-the-scenes attacks&quot; against it in an effort to steer the Pentagon away from giving the JEDI contract to Jeff Bezos, &quot;his perceived political enemy.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the Pentagon's inspector general office had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pentagon-trump-amazon-jedi-contract-162147083.html">found no evidence</a> that Trump interfered with the selection process, it also noted that several White House officials did not cooperate with its investigation. In the end, the department chose to cancel the JEDI project because it &quot;no longer meets its needs.&quot; Now, under the JWCC, the Pentagon will work with several vendors for the cloud capabilities and services it needs instead of with just a single one.</p><p>The companies' contracts will run until 2028 and will provide the DOD access to centralized management and distributed control, global accessibility, advanced data analytics and fortified security, among other capabilities.&nbsp;</p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-12-08 12:40:13+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.engadget.com/amazon-google-microsoft-oracle-pentagon-9-billion-cloud-jwcc-124013963.html?src=rss</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.engadget.com/amazon-google-microsoft-oracle-pentagon-9-billion-cloud-jwcc-124013963.html?src=rss</guid>

You could opt out of targeted ads on Facebook or Instagram if you'd rather not have the social networks track your activity. You can already decline customized ads using data from third-party apps and sites.</p><p>The board's decision wouldn't directly force Meta to change. Rather, it would ask Ireland's Data Protection Commission to apply matching orders. As Meta's European operations are officially based in Ireland, the company would have to comply.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both data boards acknowledged that there had been decisions, but didn't comment on what they entailed. We've asked Meta for comment. A spokesperson for the social media giant said it was "too early to speculate," and that the EU might still offer legal backing for targeted ads. The company argued that it had "fully" engaged with the Data Protection Commission's inquiries.</p><p>If the EU does restrict Meta's personalization, it could have a significant impact on the company's bottom line. With fewer users willing to accept targeted ads, there may be fewer people clicking those ads and encouraging advertisers to spend more on campaigns. Meta was already worried about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-ios-app-tracking-notices-192117307.html">Apple's App Tracking Transparency</a>, and warned that it might cost $10 billion in sales when it launched in 2021. The reported European measure could also prove costly, especially as it would affect Android and the web.</p><p>The EU might not be very sympathetic, as its officials have penalized Meta more than once for purported privacy violations. It faced a $402 million fine in September over allegedly illegal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-fined-405-million-euro-instagram-privacy-161348122.html">child privacy settings on Instagram</a>, and just last month received a $277 million fine for supposedly inadequate <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-fined-265-million-euros-over-data-scraping-142937633.html">safeguards against data scraping</a>. That's on top of an investigation into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-uk-probe-google-meta-ad-collusion-jedi-blue-113239217.html">possible collusion with Google</a> on display ads. Simply speaking, the Union is determined to prevent Meta's data from trading hands without consent.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-12-06 17:20:15+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.engadget.com/eu-meta-personalized-ads-ban-172015041.html?src=rss</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.engadget.com/eu-meta-personalized-ads-ban-172015041.html?src=rss</guid>

  <p id="zV7ixb">Facebook is testing ways for people to verify their age when using the platform’s dating app, including using an AI face scanning tool.</p>
<p id="OoiNum">In a blog post today, Meta <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/12/facebook-dating-age-verification/">announced</a> it would start prompting users on Facebook Dating to verify that they’re over 18 if the platform suspects a user is underage (you must be over 18 to use the dating service). Users can then confirm their age either by submitting a copy of their ID or by uploading a selfie video, which Facebook shares a portion of with a third-party company. Meta says the company, Yoti, uses facial features to estimate a user’s age without identifying them.</p>

The aim is to let you track your body to create videos or operate avatars in real time with metaverse apps like VRChat. It even offers an SDK that lets you import motion data into 3D animation apps.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently a play on the term "mocap," (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-07-14-motion-capture-explainer.html">motion capture</a>) Mocopi's six color-coded, lightweight motion sensors use "proprietary technology and a smartphone" with a dedicated app, according to Sony. "Normally, video production using motion capture requires dedicated equipment and operators," Sony wrote. "By utilizing our proprietary algorithm, 'Mocopi' realizes highly accurate motion measurement with a small number of sensors, freeing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber">VTubers</a> [virtual YouTubers] and creators involved in movie and animation production from time and place constraints."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="1aeb3047258e427c807db04c2fc51ab3"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>On December 15th, Sony will provide a software development kit (SDK) that links the motion capture data with metaverse services, along with the real-time development platform <a href="https://www.engadget.com/unity-weta-digital-acquisition-231256259.html">Unity</a> and Autodesk's animation/mocap app <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=391d1b55-7611-44fb-b248-64dc5a6ce032&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Autodesk&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzOTFkMWI1NS03NjExLTQ0ZmItYjI0OC02NGRjNWE2Y2UwMzIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXV0b2Rlc2suY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL21vdGlvbmJ1aWxkZXIvb3ZlcnZpZXc_dGVybT0xLVlFQVImdGFiPXN1YnNjcmlwdGlvbiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmE1NzkzMDMtZjE0Zi00NTEwLTgwNTktMjM2ZDdhNjNlYmVjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdvjdKdO626nNgM7XjfH9yXFnHpEfQ7xGMoYHzp7cGT9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autodesk.com%2Fproducts%2Fmotionbuilder%2Foverview%3Fterm%3D1-YEAR%26tab%3Dsubscription">MotionBuilder</a>. "This SDK expands the use of motion data for activities such as full-body tracking, thereby facilitating the development of new services in areas such as the metaverse and fitness."</p><p>In a how-to video (below), Sony shows how you can pair the sensors with the app, strap them to your body and calibrate them. From there, you can start dancing or do other movements and see the in-app avatars ape your actions. A second video showcasing some avatar animations (above) looks good, but does reveal typical motion capture issues like jitter and foot sliding.&nbsp;</p><div id="undefined"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>It's an ambitious product aimed at not only people interested in the metaverse, but animation professionals and filmmakers as well. Sony notes that you can use existing VRM avatars and export recorded videos in the MP4 format, provided you have a device with iOS 15.7.1 or Android 11. Reservations are set to start in mid-December 2022 and it will go on sale in late January 2023, but there's no word yet on North American availability.&nbsp;</p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-11-29 13:17:21+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.engadget.com/sony-mocopi-movement-tracker-metaverse-avatars-131721036.html?src=rss</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.engadget.com/sony-mocopi-movement-tracker-metaverse-avatars-131721036.html?src=rss</guid>

Markey <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senator-markey-twitter-elon-musk-letter-223210329.html"><ins>sent Musk a list of questions</ins></a> about the launch after <em>The Washington Post </em>created a “verified” account impersonating him. One day after Markey shared a copy of the letter on Twitter, Musk attacked the senator.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="21bb3b50c10949d6b9513031d8ffce1c"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">.<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@elonmusk</a> could respond to my tweets but failed to respond to my letter by yesterday’s deadline and answer basic questions about Twitter verification. Congress must end the era of failed Big Tech self-regulation and pass laws that put user safety over the whims of billionaires. <a href="https://t.co/BEn6n9EitW">https://t.co/BEn6n9EitW</a></p>— Ed Markey (@SenMarkey) <a href="https://twitter.com/SenMarkey/status/1596523892361007105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>“Perhaps it is because your real account sounds like a parody,” Musk tweeted. “And why does your pp have a mask!?” he added a few hours later, referring to Markey’s profile picture, which shows the policymaker wearing a face covering. The exchange <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senator-ed-markey-tells-elon-musk-fix-your-companies-215557841.html"><ins>prompted Markey to chastise the billionaire</ins></a>. “One of your companies is under an FTC consent decree. Auto safety watchdog NHTSA is investigating another for killing people. And you’re spending your time picking fights online,” the senator said. “Fix your companies. Or Congress will.”</p><p>As of the writing of this article, Musk has yet to respond to Markey’s latest tweet. It’s hard to say whether the senator’s call will translate to legislative action, particularly with a split between the House of Representatives and Senate. Musk did appear to answer at least one of Markey’s questions when he announced Twitter’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-colored-badges-verified-accounts-094651616.html"><ins>new verification system on Friday</ins></a>. The latest iteration of the program will feature manual authentication and different colored check marks for different types of users. "Gold check for companies, grey check for government, blue for individuals (celebrity or not) and all verified accounts will be manually authenticated before check activates," he said.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-11-26 22:44:04+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.engadget.com/senator-ed-markey-calls-224404242.html?src=rss</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.engadget.com/senator-ed-markey-calls-224404242.html?src=rss</guid>

This is how they'll possibly take our financial freedom,  via a CBDC. CBDC stands for Central Bank Digital Currency, and is a new form of digital money that is on the horizon for just about every nation on Earth.

CBDCs have already been launched fully in 11 countries, but are being tested in more than 100, including in nations that account for more than 95% of our planet's total GDP. In other words, if a CBDC hasn't hit your country yet, it very likely will soon. The criticism around CBDCs is that they will be used as the ultimate tool of surveillance and control, allowing governments to monitor citizens' every move. However, the United States and the Netherlands are already implementing laws to do just that, potentially requiring new reporting standards on almost all transactions.

The truth is, there may not be a lot we can do to stop a CBDC from arriving in our nations. But we can refuse to use one when they arrive, if they are as terrible for financial freedom as many believe.

In any case, I would love to hear your thoughts. And thank you for being here for 100 videos on this channel.

<item><title>![CDATA[Scary! CCP is to impose a communal lifestyle. A planned economy is about to go full swing]]</title><description>![CDATA[On October 31st, 2022, China's Ministry of Housing and Construction and Ministry of Civil Affairs issued a joint notice requesting each city & region to select three to five communities to start a pilot project of building "a complete community." The plan is to implement the idea nationwide in two years' time. It’s to construct  "large packages" of essential services, including communal canteens. Previously, we reported that the Chinese government has been expanding supply and distribution cooperatives throughout the country. These are all signs that the planned economy version 2.0 is starting up in China after the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party ended.   
It showed that the Communist Party at that time wanted not only to implement a system of full and unrestricted public ownership in order to control the political and economic life of the entire society but also to impose a communal lifestyle, forcing its way into the private sphere and controlling the decisions of individual life.

Dr. Yoram Hazony is an Israeli author,  philosopher, political theorist, and Bible scholar. In 1994, Dr. Hazony founded the Shalem Center in Jerusalem, which became Shalem College in 2013. Being the first liberal arts college in Israel, it attracted widespread attention, followed by much acclaim as many of the country's renowned intellectuals joined its staff. Hazony has also served as director of the John Templeton Foundation's project in Jewish Philosophical Theology, as well as a member of the Israel Council for Higher Education committee. Dr. Hazony has published many books, his 2018 work, The Virtue of Nationalism, being awarded Conservative Book of the Year in 2019. He also maintains a regularly published blog, Jerusalem Letters, that explores the topics of philosophy, politics, Judaism, Israel, and higher education. Other writings by Dr. Hazony have been published in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and American Affairs.

<item><title>![CDATA[FBI reportedly considered using Pegasus spyware in criminal investigations]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>As recently as early last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was considering using NSO Group’s infamous Pegasus spyware in criminal investigations, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/12/us/politics/fbi-pegasus-spyware-phones-nso.html"><ins>reports </ins><em><ins>The New York Times</ins></em></a>. Between late 2020 and early 2021, agency officials were in the “advanced” stages of developing plans to brief FBI leadership on the software, according to internal bureau documents and court records seen by <em>The Times</em>. Those documents also reveal the bureau had developed guidelines for federal prosecutors detailing how the FBI’s use of Pegasus would need to be disclosed during court cases.</p><p>Based on the documents, it’s unclear if the FBI had considered using the spyware against American citizens. Earlier this year, <em>The Times </em>found that the agency had tested Phantom, a version of Pegasus that can target phones with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-group-spyware-us-state-department-report-183647765.html"><ins>US numbers</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>By July 2021, the FBI eventually decided not to use Pegasus in criminal investigations. That’s the same month that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/"><em><ins>The</ins></em><ins>&nbsp;</ins><em><ins>Washington Post</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>published an investigation that claimed the software had been used to compromise the phones of two women close to murdered Saudi journalist <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-spyware-targeted-journalists-politicians-190234376.html"><ins>Jamal Khashoggi</ins></a>. A few months later, the US placed Pegasus creator NSO Group on the Commerce Department’s entity list, a designation that prevents US companies from conducting business with the firm. Despite the decision not to use Pegasus, the FBI indicated it remains open to using spyware in the future.</p><p>“Just because the FBI ultimately decided not to deploy the tool in support of criminal investigations does not mean it would not test, evaluate and potentially deploy other similar tools for gaining access to encrypted communications used by criminals,” states a <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/nso-fbi-brief/f6199b0802b4fc01/full.pdf"><ins>legal briefing</ins></a> filed by the FBI last month.</p><p>The documents appear to present a different picture of the agency’s interest in Pegasus than the one FBI Director Chris Wray shared with Congress during a closed-doors hearing this past December. “If you mean have we used it in any of our investigations to collect or target somebody, the answer is - as I’m assured - no,” he <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/fbi-nso/58a69830f3cd2e7d/full.pdf"><ins>said in response to a question from Senator Ron Wyden</ins></a>. “The reason why I hedge, and I want to be transparent, that we have acquired some of their tools for research and development. In other words, to be able to figure out how bad guys could use it, for example.”</p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-11-12 19:55:12+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.engadget.com/fbi-reportedly-considered-using-pegasus-spyware-195512125.html?src=rss</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.engadget.com/fbi-reportedly-considered-using-pegasus-spyware-195512125.html?src=rss</guid>

China has the world's largest auto market, and investors are closely watching the performance of Tesla, the largest American electric car company, in China, where many believe the growth potential is far greater than in Europe or the US. 
It is a familiar pattern for the Chinese Communist government to use Western companies to improve China's industrial capabilities. But in the case of Tesla, China's economy has already begun to crumble before the CCP can complete its scheme, and the decline will only happen faster and faster. Tesla's China dream is destined to be lost, and the longer it stays entangled with the CCP, the greater the price it will likely pay.

Soon it will be joined by others in a development that could mean the end of thousands of jobs and, Amazon argues, the creation of thousands of others.</p><p>As the robot worked, a screen displayed its progress.

<item><title>![CDATA[Twitter starts doling out 'official' checkmarks - again]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Twitter's "official" gray checkmarks seem to making their way back to accounts owned by brands, publishers and other public figures. The website <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-official-verified-checkmark-154546497.html">initially rolled out</a> its official badges — the ones you can't buy with its new $8 Blue subscription service — on November 9th. But it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-kills-twitter-official-verified-checkmarks-175648560.html">paused deployment</a> and pulled them back down from accounts that already had them, including Engadget's, just a few hours later. Twitter VP Esther Crawford explained that the checkmarks will be back, it's just that the social network is going to hand them out to "government and commercial entities" at first.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/10/23452625/twitter-verified-official-blue-gray-check"><em>The Verge</em></a> reports, the badge has now started reappearing on brand and company accounts like Coca-Cola's and Nintendo of America's. Twitter's own accounts are also displaying the gray checkmark. And some publications like <em>The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg</em> and <em>Wired</em> have them now, as well. It's unclear if rollout has truly started this time, and if it has anything to do with the influx of impersonator and parody accounts that have flooded the website since its $8 verification has debuted.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Twitter" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/16cbe1a0-617d-11ed-aebe-c40290fda73b" style="height: 741; width: 800;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twitter</div></figure><p>Shortly after the company's paid verification scheme went live, fake accounts shelled out for a subscription and got themselves verified. That led to legitimate-looking accounts tweeting out questionable things, such as a fake Nintendo of America posting a picture of Mario giving Twitter the middle finger and a fake LeBron James announcing that he was requesting a trade. On its support account, <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1590471013154050048">Twitter said yesterday</a> that it was not "putting an 'Official' label on accounts" yet, but it's "aggressively going after impersonation and deception." The gray checkmark, however, could help people figure out if they're dealing with actual companies and public figures.&nbsp;</p><p>As a response to the situation, the company implemented a new rule that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blocks-new-accounts-twitter-blue-114446338.html">blocks accounts</a> created on or after November 9th from its $8 Blue subscription to prevent them from getting instant verification. Twitter owner Elon Musk also announced that going forward, accounts doing parody impersonation must include the word "parody" in their name, not just in their bio. That's been a part of <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/parody-account-policy">Twitter's policy for years</a>, but we're guessing the website will now be enforcing the rule more strictly in light of recent events.&nbsp;</p><div id="5b6e0388e2114287a565dfa77b0caf5a"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Going forward, accounts engaged in parody must include “parody” in their name, not just in bio</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1590884973535711232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-11-11 04:56:18+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.engadget.com/twitter-starts-doling-out-official-checkmarks-again-045618923.html?src=rss</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.engadget.com/twitter-starts-doling-out-official-checkmarks-again-045618923.html?src=rss</guid>

  <p id="Hfi8ZS">Elon Musk seems intent on turning Twitter into a bank, complete with what he describes as a “high-yield money market account,” debit cards, checks, and loans. He described his plans during a last-minute meeting with staff today, and you can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/10/23452196/elon-musk-twitter-employee-meeting-q-and-a">read a full transcript of that here</a>.</p>
<p id="lxIO6A">Musk broached the topic of payments during his introduction, saying that “I think there’s this transformative opportunity in payments,” adding that the goal is “enabling people on Twitter to able to send money anywhere in the world instantly and in real-time. We just want to make it as useful as possible.” He said that the feature, along with “video content and compensating content creators” and improving search, is a “high priority.”</p>

<item><title>![CDATA[Disney now matches Netflix's subscriber numbers across its combined services]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Disney+ has welcomed 12.1 million new subscribers for the company's <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disneys-fiscal-full-year-and-q4-2022-earnings-results-webcast/">fourth fiscal quarter</a> ending on October 1st, and according to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-earnings-q4-fourth-quarter-results-164357146.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90cmVsbG8uY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAknfTQfApjr_I_IewV3D0m_JHls6gGwATsRR9WS5qJ6YV-o2SGn7BKTcjaqM3NBnG7XW3STXHgeA4Xi-2pOOZ5ChIY5Kc3lsvSZxM4FbsRGcOld3-NDaHRvcZC4qFHtX8p6UVNANNog6z8zT938-bOOZXkZNbitTn2ZDGTa29FH"><em>Yahoo Finance</em></a>, that's 3 million more than analyst estimates. In all, Walt Disney added 14.6 million subscriptions for Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, bringing its total number of streaming subscribers so far to around 236 million. While Disney+ alone with its 164 million subscribers have yet to reach Netflix numbers, all three of the company's services combined had amassed members that can rival the streaming giant's. Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-adds-2-41-million-subscribers-soaring-past-expectations/">revealed</a> that it has around 223.09 million subscribers during its latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-begin-charging-extra-user-fees-early-next-year-221450520.html">earnings report</a> in October.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the impressive growth in subscriber number, Disney's operating loss for streaming increased from $0.8 billion to $1.5 billion for the quarter. Disney+ experienced more losses within the period due to higher production and technology costs, as well as an increase in marketing expenses. There were also no Premier Access releases for the quarter, such as last year's <em>Black Widow</em> and <em>Jungle Cruise</em>. That said, the losses were offset in part by higher subscription costs, which will become even higher in December.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Walt Disney CEO Bob Chapek said that the company expects its streaming losses to narrow going forward, thanks to its price increases and the launch of an ad-supported tier on Disney+. The company even believes that Disney+ is on track to achieving profitability in the fiscal year of 2024, assuming the lack of a "meaningful shift in the economic climate." If you'll recall, Disney is raising its streaming prices across the board this December, and the ad-supported tier for Disney+ is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-price-increase-ad-based-service-204903273.html">launching on December 8th</a> for $11 a month.&nbsp;</p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-11-09 05:54:15+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.engadget.com/disney-streaming-services-earnings-055415800.html?src=rss</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.engadget.com/disney-streaming-services-earnings-055415800.html?src=rss</guid>

Now they’re telling him they’re scared of what they’re seeing</p><p>Back in the 1980s, when climate research began to really take off, scientists were desperate to retain their credibility as they unravelled the potentially dire consequences of the “new” phenomenon of global warming.

<item><title>![CDATA[More Chinese can't stand the CCP as the planned economy returns to China]]</title><description>![CDATA[#chinainsights #chinaeconomy #chineseprotest

Following the conclusion of the 20th Communist Party Congress, CCP Leader Xi Jinping was re-elected as General Secretary of the Party for a third term. But protests against him and against the CCP's policies have been growing among the masses. 
The CCP has again conducted strict investigations into "naked officials" before the 20th National Congress. Naked official refers to the CCP officials who stay in mainland China while their wives and children reside abroad. 
Many analysts believe that after the 20th National Congress, after the top level of the CCP has been reshuffled, it will be the turn of the lower and middle levels of the officialdom to reshuffle their positions and personnel.

<item><title>![CDATA[How to download your Twitter data]]</title><description>![CDATA[<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>The future of Twitter has now become much murkier, thanks to the recent shake-up in Twitter&rsquo;s management. But even if you&rsquo;re not wondering how you&rsquo;ll have access to your Twitter account as it is, grabbing a copy of your data is never a bad idea. Especially when it&rsquo;s so easy&mdash;exporting your account info is straightforward. Just a few clicks (and a reauthentication of your account credentials) will put in your request for your data archive, which you&rsquo;ll receive a day or so later.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s how to do it.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-download-a-backup-of-your-twitter-data">How to download a backup of your Twitter data</h2>



<p>Before you begin, verify that your email address is confirmed. Also your phone number, if you&rsquo;ve also added that information to your account. You should also be logged into your Twitter account from the same browser you&rsquo;ll use to download the archive<strong>.</strong></p>



<ol><li>Log into your account. In the left-hand navigation bar, click on the More icon (a circle icon with three horizontal dots). If you only see the icon, you&rsquo;ll see its name pop up when you hover your mouse over it.</li></ol><div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Twitter left-navigation bar with &quot;More&quot; highlighted" class="wp-image-1368241" height="661" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/twitter1-mrk.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<ol start="2"><li>Click on <em>Settings and Support</em>, then <em>Settings and privacy</em>.</li></ol><div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Twitter Settings and Privacy setting highlighted" class="wp-image-1368240" height="529" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/twitter2-mrk.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<ol start="3"><li>Choose <em>Your account</em>, then <em>Download an archive of your data</em>.</li></ol><div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Twitter &quot;download your data&quot; option highlighted" class="wp-image-1368242" height="585" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/twitter3-mrk.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<ol start="4"><li>Enter your password, then the code generated by the two-step verification process. It can be sent to the email or phone number associated with your account.</li></ol><ol start="5"><li>Click on the blue <em>Request archive</em> button.</li></ol><div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Twitter &quot;Request archive&quot; button highlighted" class="wp-image-1368239" height="595" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/twitter4-mrk.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>As mentioned above, Twitter says that preparing the archive can take a day or more. You&rsquo;ll receive a notice in the app when the zip file is ready for download.</p>



<p>If you also want to leave Twitter, you can deactivate your account while you&rsquo;re in your settings. We have <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1368266/">a rundown of the step-by-step instructions</a>, but the quick summary is you&rsquo;ll simply navigate to <em>Settings and Privacy</em> &gt; <em>Your Account</em> &gt; <em>Deactivate your account</em>. After you click on the Deactivate link and enter your password, your account will disappear immediately from the site and enter cold storage for 30 days. If you have second thoughts before that period ends, you can reactivate with everything intact. Otherwise, after the 30 day mark, it vanishes for good.</p>

The joke in that case is on the shareholders. Having hailed Mark Zuckerberg as a visionary, and having given him effective control on that basis through a form of “golden share” voting structure, investors were shocked to discover it is impossible to sack the boss when he pursues visions they do not like.</p><p>Meta’s share price is down 73% this year to its lowest level since 2015 for reasons that go beyond the general big tech sell-off. The stock has fallen so far because Zuckerberg is squandering tens of billions of the company’s dollars on building <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/27/metas-shares-dip-is-proof-metaverse-plan-never-really-had-legs-facebook">his mysterious “metaverse”</a> and appears determined to sink even more cash into the virtual reality black hole.

Or, at the very least, provide context those users feel might better inform other tweeps. And, for some unknown reason, there weren't many instances of Twitter users taking advantage of this function on Democrat tweets until <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aoc-free-speech" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> took over.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

But that, along with higher interest rates, is what’s coming</p><p>Economic policy in the UK is peppered with the language of S&amp;M. The Treasury demands budgetary discipline. The Bank of England sees the need for monetary tightening. Policymakers talk of the need to avoid <a href="https://ukandeu.ac.uk/whos-afraid-of-fiscal-dominance/">“fiscal dominance”</a>. Only in Britain could there ever have been an instrument of monetary control known as the corset.</p><p>Judging by the way in which the Treasury and the Bank are behaving, it’s easy to see why the novelist Anthony Burgess once described the English as “profoundly masochistic”.

But now it emerges even the poster boy for the idea is back toiling 50 hours a week</p><p>Bad news for all the aspiring “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/06/quiet-quitting-why-doing-the-bare-minimum-at-work-has-gone-global">quiet quitters</a>” out there: the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/08/quiet-quitting-not-real-work-culture">dubious trend</a> is officially over. A few months ago, media outlets were working overtime to push out pieces about how nobody wants to work hard any more. Hustle culture is over, the narrative went: burnt-out employees are doing the bare minimum. Now, however, the economy is rubbish and a recession is imminent. Instead of quiet quitting, everyone is loudly labouring.</p><p>Well, maybe not quite everyone, but one <a href="https://qz.com/the-guy-who-inspired-the-quiet-quitting-movement-is-b-1849704130">guy certainly</a> is. In March, Insider featured an anonymous recruiter using the pseudonym Justin who had started to deliberately slack off at work. That column inspired a TikTok; soon thinkpieces on quiet quitting were everywhere. The trend appears to have been short-lived though. The magazine recently caught up with Justin and found that his work attitude had shifted dramatically. Some of his colleagues had been laid off and he was worried about the economy. “Today Justin, the OG Quiet Quitter, is back to going above and beyond,” <a href="https://qz.com/the-guy-who-inspired-the-quiet-quitting-movement-is-b-1849704130">writes the journalist in the latest update</a>. “He is working 50 hours a week.”</p><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/02/with-the-global-economy-on-the-rocks-quiet-quitting-is-no-longer-a-thing">Continue reading...</a>]]</description><pubDate>2022-11-02 08:00:56+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/02/with-the-global-economy-on-the-rocks-quiet-quitting-is-no-longer-a-thing</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/02/with-the-global-economy-on-the-rocks-quiet-quitting-is-no-longer-a-thing</guid>

Twitter’s co-founder Jack Dorsey is beta testing a new app called <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/10-18-2022-the-at-protocol">Bluesky</a>, but there’s no launch date yet.</p><p>However, tech-savvy users are rallying around <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a>, a six-year-old social media platform popular among a devoted base of left-leaning niche communities. Mastodon, named after the extinct tusked animal, is decentralized, which means it can’t be controlled by a single corporation or space billionaire. That’s clearly appealing to the flood of users who have signed up since Musk’s Twitter takeover, with more than 70,000 users joining Mastodon on the day after his announcement alone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/nov/01/mastodon-twitter-elon-musk-takeover">Continue reading...</a>]]</description><pubDate>2022-11-02 05:00:52+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/nov/01/mastodon-twitter-elon-musk-takeover</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/nov/01/mastodon-twitter-elon-musk-takeover</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Elon Musk says Twitter Blue will cost $8 and be required for verification]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Twitter is increasing the price of its subscription service. Moving forward, Twitter Blue will cost $8 per month in the US, with pricing in other countries adjusted for the purchasing power of consumers in those markets,  Twitter owner and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-ceo-141551106.html">CEO</a> Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587498907336118274?s=20&amp;t=VkASdrDP71AKDqDJFT2Ywg">announced today</a>. The $3 jump from Blue's current <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-raises-blue-price-5-a-month-092715087.html">$5 per month fee</a> amounts to a 60 percent price increase.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, Twitter plans to add new perks to the service. As a subscriber, you'll see fewer ads and have the ability to post longer videos and audio — which Twitter had <a href="https://twitter.com/twitterblue/status/1499835596004495360">tested</a> prior to Musk's takeover. It will also give you priority in replies, mentions and Twitter's search feature, perks Musk claims are essential to reducing the amount of spam on the platform. "Twitter's current lords &amp; peasants system for who has or doesn't have a blue checkmark is bullshit," Musk said, all but confirming verification will be tied to Twitter Blue subscriptions. Lastly, Twitter Blue will include the ability to bypass paywalls — though that will come later and will depend on Twitter forging the necessary publisher partnerships.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="9ca838bda0634687804306427cadf4a1"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Twitter’s current lords &amp; peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark is bullshit. <br /><br />Power to the people!

On Sunday, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-considers-making-verification-a-twitter-blue-perk-051906957.html">two separate reports</a> said the Tesla and SpaceX CEO was considering increasing the price of Twitter Blue to as much as $20 per month and making the subscription a requirement for verification. Musk appeared to reconsider pricing after a tweet from author Stephen King criticizing the plan went viral. "We need to pay the bills somehow," Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587312517679878144?s=20&amp;t=xlgFt27tFVmaEWVma0svqA">said</a>. "Twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers. How about $8?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Musk claimed the changes to Twitter Blue would also give the company a way to support content creators. On Monday, the owner of <a href="https://twitter.com/nibellion">Nibellion</a>, one of Twitter's most prolific and popular gaming news accounts, said he was <a href="https://kotaku.com/nibel-nibellion-twitter-patreon-elon-musk-gaming-news-1849722335">abandoning the platform</a>, citing Musk's takeover of the company and the difficulty he encountered monetizing his work. “I have miscalculated the value of my Twitter activity and realize that it is nothing worth supporting by itself for the vast majority of people," Nibel said. "It is not me who is popular, but it is that work that is useful. It is not valuable by itself, but a comfortable timesaver, and I get that now.” Accounts like Nibel are the lifeblood of Twitter. While they only represent about 25 percent of the user base, they account for more than <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/11/15/2-comparing-highly-active-and-less-active-tweeters/">97 percent of tweets</a> you see on the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>Tweaks to Twitter Blue are likely only the start of the changes Musk has planned for Twitter. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-reportedly-orders-layoffs-at-twitter-221121536.html">According to The New York Times</a>, Musk has ordered company-wide layoffs that could affect as much as 50 percent of Twitter's 7,500-person workforce. He is also reportedly considering <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-orders-vine-reboot-203652582.html">bringing back Vine</a>, the company's long-defunct short-form video service.&nbsp;</p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-11-01 18:03:19+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-price-increasing-8-per-month-180319987.html?src=rss</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-price-increasing-8-per-month-180319987.html?src=rss</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[YouTube suspended Louder with Crowder for our episode about Elon Musk's Twitter takeover]]</title><description>![CDATA[<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32019186&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C24%2C0" /><br /><br /><p>
	I’ve been here before, but this one is… very different. YouTube has issued yet ANOTHER hard strike to the channel. No specifics have been provided but they claim that our segment on Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover is a violation of their deliberately opaque guidelines.
</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

</p><p>Why is this one more severe than the others? Well, it’s our 2nd “strike” in 90 days. 3 strikes mean permanent removal.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="67b54" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=32019162&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Do you remember the reason for our last strike? <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/youtube-suspends-crowder-kari-lake" target="_blank">It was due to none other than Kari Lake pointing to election-related issues</a> for a primary IN WHICH SHE WON!!</p><p>
	Look, we are going into an election season. One where, if the scales of media were balanced, conservative Republicans would win in a landslide! They can’t have that.
</p><p>
	Make no mistake, there is a reason that these two strikes directly relate to:
</p><ul>
<li>A future governor who has spoken out against big tech</li>
<li>Support of a man (Musk) whose purchase and plan for a big tech platform would fundamentally allow more free and fair media coverage of elections.</li>
</ul><p>
	It’s also no coincidence that this happened as we were nearing 100,000,000 plays/downloads within 30 days. It’s not about the number. It’s about YOU choosing truth over their lies.
</p><p>
	So what do we do? Do we roll over and die? Hell no!
</p><p>
	Starting Monday through November 17th (back on YouTube on November 21st), we will be streaming <a href="https://rumble.com/c/StevenCrowder" target="_blank">exclusively on Rumble</a> and of course the extended show on <a href="https://get.blazetv.com/lwc/" target="_blank">Mug Club</a> as we always do.
</p><p>
	Make no mistake, the machine is in full force. They are deathly afraid of you and the tectonic shift which is beginning to take place in our country.
</p><p>
<span></span>Never give up, never surrender, and FIGHT LIKE HELL!!
</p><p>
	See you Monday.

  <p id="7TenCF">Elon Musk, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/27/23184519/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-deal-complete-agreement">Twitter’s new owner</a>, says the company is setting up a council to make important moderation decisions at the company. In <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1586059953311137792">a tweet on Friday</a>, Musk said the “council” will have “widely diverse viewpoints” and that “no major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.”</p>
<p id="zSptMG">Part of Musk’s professed reasoning for buying Twitter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/15/23025120/elon-musk-twitter-free-speech-government-censorship">hinged on making it a platform for “free speech,”</a> and he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/10/23065413/elon-musk-donald-trump-twitter-ban-lift">has said he’d consider</a> letting controversial figures like former president Donald Trump back onto the platform. With Friday’s announcement, it seems as if he’s placing that sort of decision into the hands of a council.</p>

The reshuffle of the Chinese leadership has spooked foreign investors. The next day, on Oct. 24th, Chinese stocks suffered their worst day in Hong Kong since the global financial crisis in 2008, as foreign investors rushed to sell Chinese stocks. Nearly all the stocks in the Hang Sheng index were lower, with Chinese internet and technology stocks being hit particularly hard. 
Analysts generally expect China's economy to slow in Xi's third term, not primarily because of the labor force demographics, productivity, real estate, etc. that drive growth, but because of the CCP's regressive economic policies.

Support independent research and analysis by joining my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone 

Huawei is the world’s largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment and one of the top smartphone makers in the globe. The Huawei empire now sells products or carries the traffic of Internet users in 170 countries. And for over a decade, the Shenzen giant faced and dismissed accusations that they have pwned billions of users on behalf of the authoritarian Chinese government. Whether or not there is a Huawei backdoor must be thoroughly scrutinized before any conclusion can be made. Hard evidence is scarce. This is an analysis of all major accusations and allegations of backdoor planted into Huawei products.

Support independent research and analysis by joining my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone 

The Internet is a giant network of privately owned spaces open to public, where every participant knows the exact identity and location of one another and where corporate stalking is a perfectly legitimate business model. If you are not okay with automated decisions being made about your every move, you should consider creating an anonymous identity.

Anonymity is the most powerful mitigation strategy on a publicly observable network such as the Internet. It is the most direct path towards privacy. This guide will tell you exactly what you need to know and do in order to create and maintain your very own anonymous identity. 

The Internet is a privacy nightmare because every action is by default identifiable and linkable. That means actions always lead to a unique location and/or account on the network and actions can built a profile over time. Linkability and identifiability are your biggest privacy and anonymity threats on the Internet. For maximum anonymity, both of these threats need to be mitigated to the fullest extent possible. 

Our first step with any service will be to dissociate our account details from our personal information. The second step is to compartmentalize our anonymous identities so that they are isolated from our personal identities.

Dissociation and isolation of your anonymous identities are not the only steps to keep your anonymity. Be extremely cautious of what types of data you submit to these services while using them. Always think of the linkability and identifiability threats when using these accounts.

<item><title>![CDATA['Based' Paganism vs. Christianity]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write about Paganism recently. I will frame it as a response to an email I received within the past day or so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Luke,</p>
<p>First off, I would like to thank you for all your efforts in making everything
you know accessible to everyone. You have exposed me to some of the most
thought-provoking people on the internet and Varg is one of them. I was
wondering if you can write an article or make a video on what you think about
Varg&rsquo;s Paganism in relation to you choosing Orthodox Christianity. I know that
you briefly talked about it in one of your livestreams, however, I would like
to better understand why you don&rsquo;t practice Paganism yourself. My background is
Serbian and most Serbians follow the Serbian Orthodox Church, but after
watching Varg&rsquo;s videos, I&rsquo;m conflicted. I agree with a lot of what Varg says
about Christianity, but my father long ago told me to follow the Serbian
Orthodox Church if I were to become religious. I&rsquo;m sure that many people feel
the same way after watching Varg&rsquo;s videos, and your thoughts on it would
greatly help people like me make up their minds.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p><em>redacted</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will sum up my answer to this email in bullet points, then explain what I mean.</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; is not a real thing and has nothing to do with paganism in history.</li>
<li>The most direct cultural link between modern man and antiquity is the orthodox Christian Church.</li>
<li>Truth matters&mdash;&ldquo;Picking&rdquo; a religion on personal preferences is brain-dead and self-refuting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="your-average-pagan">Your Average Pagan</h2>
<p>Many people probably don&rsquo;t know who Varg Vikernes is, but since the email brings him up, I will talk about him as an example of where paganism leads.
Modern &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; is not an authentic tradition handed down over the ages.
It is an attempt of modern disconnected people to recreate or re-engineer a culture, time and place they have absolutely no contact with.
This ultimately makes &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; a modernist Rorschach test where individuals can more-or-less create the religion they want.</p>
<h3 id="paganism-with-modern-goggles">Paganism with modern goggles</h3>
<p>Varg&rsquo;s particular &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; is a kind of scientific euhemerism: he doesn&rsquo;t actually believe in gods in the way an ancient pagan would have, but that the concepts of the gods represent scientific or other knowledge.
(This is where the placenta meme around him comes from after all, when he and his wife related assorted pagan myths and items to the tree-like appearance of a human placenta.)
He has also reduced classical abstract spiritual concepts into hormones and other related things.
In essence, he has created a pseudo-paganism that is compatible with modern materialism.</p>
<p>Varg had cited and recommended works such as Frazer&rsquo;s <em>Golden Bough</em> as influential on his thought which is of a similar vein.
This book was part of a wider movement in the English-speaking rationalist world to rationalize and explain myth.
It goes without saying that I think this all comes from the assumption of modern man that all ancient people underlyingly thought like Neil deGrasse Tyson.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-until-legend-becomes-myth">How long until legend becomes myth?</h3>
<p>More plausible is the viewpoint I&rsquo;ve spoken of in works such as <a href="https://notrelated.xyz/#02.04"><em>Hamlet&rsquo;s Mill</em></a>.
It alleges that <em>one specific</em> prehistoric civilization used myth to transmit scientific knowledge, but being thousands of years out from that civilization, the descendant stories are distorted, partial and can only be related after extensive study.
They allege that &ldquo;Hamlet stories&rdquo; are similar in origin and actually carry astrological information, including the idea of the procession of the equinoxes.</p>
<p>But Varg&rsquo;s quasi-euhemerism makes a much stronger claim, that all our &ldquo;forebears&rdquo; (as he tends to call them) left an entire encyclopedia of scientific knowledge in stories that have remained unblemished and mostly unchanged over thousands or <em>millions</em> of years since the Neanderthals, who he views as the Trve Europeans.</p>
<p>This stronger claim should be absurd on its face, as it assumes that over the millennia, there is little to no addition, subtraction or change of folklore.
The <em>Hamlet&rsquo;s Mill</em> model admits that this does happen, but Varg is dealing with a much longer scale and often makes very specific claims about some myths.
What I think Varg is truly doing when he looks at a pagan myth and sees a placenta, he is seeing statistical noise and fitting that noise to the many possibilities in his head.
(I will also say that this is somewhat the modus operandi of many capital-T &ldquo;Traditionalists&rdquo; in the vein of Evola or Guénon.)</p>
<aside>
This is principally a response to the theories that Varg put forth around 2016-2018 when I would occasionally watch his videos. I'm sure it's very possible that he endorses things very different now, since this "paganism" is not anything concrete.
</aside>
<h2 id="is-christianity-a-departure-from-european-tradition">Is Christianity a departure from European tradition?</h2>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve tried to emphasize <a href="https://notrelated.xyz/#02.02">in some places</a> is the general wrongness of the idea of the cultural &ldquo;quantum leap&rdquo; or &ldquo;discontinuity&rdquo; between Prechristian and Christian Europe.
This is a highly important issue for many putative pagans, because they view the &ldquo;change&rdquo; of Europe over to Christianity as perhaps the start of the now constant and perpetual leftist cultural revolution.</p>
<p>This is the idea, which most people and &ldquo;based&rdquo; pagans have even by osmosis, that the Christianization of Europe was a radical break from history and tradition.</p>
<p>This is true only on the Christian metric: obviously the salvation of Europe is a quantum leap.
However, melodramatic pagans will lament that this is when Europe have up its &ldquo;European&rdquo; soul and adopted a &ldquo;Jewish&rdquo; or &ldquo;desert&rdquo; religion which put the continent on a totally different and out-of-touch cultural direction.</p>
<h3 id="pagan-philosophy-and-christianity">Pagan Philosophy and Christianity</h3>
<p>Christian theology, including Trinitarian theology has direct and undeniable &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; analogues and imitators:
Neoplatonism expresses a kind of theological trinity as well (the One, the Intellect and the Soul), albeit one more similar to Origen&rsquo;s trinity where a hierarchy of the three persons exist.</p>
<p>In the cosmogony of the <em>Poemandres</em>, a Hermetic work, shows a pagan creation myth wherein God creates the world via his <em>Logos</em>, as in the first chapter of St. John&rsquo;s gospel, which also has a trinitarian and monotheistic unity with God (differing from Christianity in its panentheism).</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the linked podcast <a href="https://notrelated.xyz/#02.02">episode above</a>, Stoic philosophy is a component needed to understand the opening of the gospel of John and is part of the philosophical backdrop of early Christian theology.</p>
<p>Medieval esoteric doctrines and alchemy viewed all of nature as trinitarian, possessing body, mind, and spirit (salt, sulfur and mercury), which was related directly to the Triune nature of God.
Even specific mystical sects like Mithraism or the many forms of Gnosticism are tied closely to the development of Christianity.</p>
<p>All of these intellectual strands were intertwined with Christianity since the beginning of the written expression of Christian theology.</p>
<p>A pagan now has to ask himself: if Hermeticism or Mithraism had taken over as a universal religion of Europe, would they loathe it like they loathe Christianity and view it as a radical departure from &ldquo;paganism?&rdquo;
Note that Hermeticism had an alleged Egyptian origin, and Mithraism had a orientalist/Iranic origin.</p>
<p>Note that none of my point here is specifically that Christianity influenced or created these other philosophies or that they influenced (providentially) Christianity.
What is important is that looking at it dispassionately, we cannot deem Christianity as some cultural departure from &ldquo;real&rdquo; European culture without also throwing out this entire philosophical tradition as a whole.</p>
<p>Medieval Christians would often look at Greek Philosophy as another covenant of God established to prepare mankind intellectually for the revelation of the Trinity.
(Note also that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCjX0il3wkc">Dante and others</a> represent Christians who viewed the Roman Empire also as part of a divine plan.)</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Christian religion is non-cultural and thus universal/catholic. There are cultural aspects associated with it, but there&rsquo;s a difference between essence and accidents.
Of those cultural aspects, they are nearly all European, not, as some allege, Hebrew or Jewish.
Most of the New Testament is quite literally an explication of why this religion which accepts the Hebrew Scriptures is markedly non-Jewish and why Jewish practices like circumcision and sacrifice are sacrilegious.</p>
<p>So the view we should get from this is that Christianization was no cultural leap into an alien worldview, but something whose intellectual side happened slowly over centuries and would only be viewed as spiritual, not culturally distinct from its environment.</p>
<h3 id="which-change-is-good">Which change is good?</h3>
<p>Note that even Varg admits that religious interpretation and practice changes with the centuries.
In his interpretation and even in his RPG, MYFAROG (which is really just an expression of his paganism and worldview), characters can have one of two &ldquo;Life Stances&rdquo; or religious inclinations: <em>Seiðr</em> or  <em>Âsatrû</em>.
Seiðr &ldquo;tradition,&rdquo; represents a kind of animism, witchcraft or spell-casting, while Âsatrû represents the worship of pagan gods.
Characters can choose either life stance, but one can only change from Seiðr to Âsatrû, which is a representation of the alleged historical shift in early history from animistic to polytheistic practices.</p>
<p>If we accept this cultural transition as &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; in terms of cultural continuity, on what grounds could we also mark as verboten a shift from polytheism to monotheism?
After all, the pagan philosophy of Plato and Aristotle even from the earliest was monotheistic at its core, and even today, the world&rsquo;s one remaining &ldquo;polytheistic&rdquo; religion, Hinduism only appears so on the surface, but has at its core its own monad and final cause: Brahman.</p>
<h2 id="tradition-vs-inventing-your-own-religion">Tradition vs. Inventing your own religion</h2>
<p>To learn of Christian theology, thus, is to set oneself down a road of millennia of learning with often with no delineation between Christian and Prechristian thought.
By the same token, learning of secular philosophy, even as an atheist might lead you to Christianity, as was the case with me.
There is no obvious discontinuity, either in thought or practice.</p>
<p>But modern day &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; does indeed have such a gap.
To be a &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; does not involve communing with a centuries-old tradition passed down generation-to-generation from antiquity.</p>
<p>It is modern people imagining based on T.V. shows, books and their own creativity what Prechristian Europe was like and then putting on their own imitation of it.
They might see something they dislike in the world, blame it on Christians and then imagine a world without it.
This invariably comes with retrojecting their own modern values and assumptions on the past.</p>
<p>After all, we Christians can sit down with an Orthodox Priest or grow up in a Orthodox household and have a direct, personal contact with a tradition and understand how people who are part of it think and act.
We have no tangible contact with Prechristian European paganism, even out of intellectual interest.
Understanding how Europeans truly thought and acted is an issue of cultural reconstruction and theory.
Traditional folklore and practices are still very much alive, but they are now decked in a Christian garb.
We do celebrate Christmas for Our Lord&rsquo;s birth, but everyone knows that nearly all of the practices of that season of the many nations of Europe predate Christianization.</p>
<h3 id="the-worst-possible-decision">The Worst Possible Decision.</h3>
<p>All this said, the absolute worst self-own possible would be someone who has direct and easy access to the Orthodox Church and abandons it or leaves it for a false &ldquo;religion&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t even exist off of the internet and has no organic connection to reality, like Neo-Paganism.</p>
<p>So my recommendation to the emailer above should be obvious.</p>
<p>Being physically close to the Orthodox Church is a huge asset, but even being able to travel to one occasionally is a massive grace. Everyone should be taking advantage of that as often as possible.</p>
<h3 id="pagan-gurus">Pagan Gurus</h3>
<p>Because it is ungrounded and ahistorical, modern &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; thus naturally exists as a kind of extreme Protestant guru-centered feel-goodery where since there is absolutely no tether to a genuine preserved tradition, a man can make up an unfalsifiable claim about what true &ldquo;Paganism&rdquo; is and sell it as legit.</p>
<p>I mentioned Varg earlier, who has concocted a &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; that consists in claiming that their lore and practice embed scientific information.
He doesn&rsquo;t <em>believe</em> in pagan gods, unless we&rsquo;re talking about belief in a very evasive and meaningless Jordan Peterson kind of way.
If we could actually transport a prehistoric pagan to our day and speak to him, he would probably either be confused or bemused by this very modern worldview, but we can&rsquo;t even do this.</p>
<p>Most pagans are not &ldquo;based&rdquo; like Varg anyway (he lives a minimalist and traditional lifestyle in rural France with an ever-growing family).
Most &ldquo;pagans&rdquo; are leftists who like &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; because they hate God and nature and morality and imagine that pagans were demented sexual perverts like they are.</p>
<h2 id="truth">Truth</h2>
<p>Notice that I had specifically avoided the most important issue: Truth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this because when people are asking to convert to something just because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;based,&rdquo; <em>Truth</em> is unfortunately not necessarily their concern, so I&rsquo;ve first addressed issues that do concern them.</p>
<p>The reality is, thankfully, that truth is the most &ldquo;based&rdquo; thing of all&mdash;And it is entirely cringe to believe in something because it sounds cool to you.
If you think you can decide your own truth, you are no different from someone who thinks they can decide their own pronouns, literally.</p>
<p>Even in the email above, he refers to me &ldquo;choosing&rdquo; orthodox Christianity as if it were an issue of personal taste.
If I liked pop music and people rolling on the ground, perhaps I would be just as justified converting to some Pentecostal sect.
This is silly.</p>
<p>The greatest deception is that religion is this separate category about &ldquo;feelings&rdquo; or &ldquo;preference&rdquo; and not truth.
Atheist and spiritual R*dditor Stephen Jay Gould put this in words in the modern era, calling science and religion &ldquo;non-overlapping magesteria,&rdquo; declaring in a laughable attempt at big-braned centrism that nothing in material reality is relevant to religion and nothing in religion is relevant to material reality.</p>
<p>This is strange because people can research the philosophies I mentioned earlier, Platonism, Gnosticism, Stoicism, Hermeticism and can analyze and critique them and look at them as models of reality perfectly comparable to modern philosophical assumptions and approaches.
But we have been taught to view Christianity as this separate category, that can&rsquo;t possibly be a model of reality, but is a something merely &ldquo;moral&rdquo; or &ldquo;personal&rdquo; or &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; which are all terms that have been debased to mean nothing at all.</p>
<p>A Christian believes that Jesus&rsquo;s resurrection was a true historical event, and a prelude of a general resurrection to come and that he established a Church and sacraments which are his vehicles for having man recover from sin within this life to prepare for his roles in the next.
The orthodox Christian Church is an unbroken chain since that period, and oft built on yet older philosophical and liturgical practices.</p>
<p>If you find this alien or God unbelieveable, you can do yourself the favor of prayer and visit a priest and see what happens.</p>
<h3 id="they-dont-even-believe-it">They don&rsquo;t even believe it.</h3>
<p>To contrast, pagans do not believe in pagan gods. Their brains are 100% modern and materialistic in mindset, and if they ironically say they believe in gods, it is out of some kind of Petersonian fake metaphorical &ldquo;belief&rdquo; in a concept or that &ldquo;Zeus&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a person, but is some kind of abstraction symbolizing the weather or something silly.
The only thing sillier is for them to claim that people in the ancient world <em>didn&rsquo;t really believe in them either</em>, but practiced entire religions meta-ironically for some social reasons.
If they believe in a &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; nature, it is not one beyond or above matter, but instead derived from it: it is psychological, hormonal, etc.</p>
<p>Modern paganism is neither a tradition, nor a religion, nor even a belief.
It is just a new identity which supposedly flexes some kind of disposition to the world which is not even consistent across pagans because there is no basis for any of it.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="real-baste-european-pagans">Real Baste European Pagans</h3>
<p>Christians, however, do believe in pagan gods.
Christians have always admitted the reality of spiritual beings, including the demonic.
You can take the Michael Heiser/Divine Council pill on this if you&rsquo;re interested:
While there is only one Creator and Supreme God, he created many among his heavenly host, and originally appointed them to the different races on earth.
Many rebelled and set themselves up as specific gods of their appointed races.</p>
<p>One of the purposes of Christ&rsquo;s coming was to vanquish these usurpers, and thus paganism/polytheism, which obviously has been successful.
(Note that the <a href="https://lindypress.net/book?pk=6">Book of Enoch</a> in Chapter 10 prophecies that these fallen angels would be judged 70 generations after the Enochian period, which cross-referencing with the Gospel of Luke, it is exactly 70 generations until Christ.)
Now the issues of faith are not so much polytheism, but heresy and then atheism, which is a significant enough change in the cosmic dynamic.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-07-29 11:53:20+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/christianity-based-paganism/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/christianity-based-paganism/</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Minimizing Liabilities Is Making It.]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>The default way to look at financial &ldquo;independence&rdquo; nowadays is to think that means &ldquo;making a lot of money.&rdquo;
That&rsquo;s understandable.</p>
<p>But then you see stuff like this:</p>

<figure class="titleimg"><img alt="60% of millennials earning over $100,000 say they're living paycheck to paycheck." src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/millennial-paycheck.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Or this:</p>

<figure class="title"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/net-worth.jpg" /><figcaption>It takes until 30 for a person to be as rich as they were when they were born. (And this is average net worth, median would be significantly worse.)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The longer you mentally analyze the second picture, the more depressing it will get. Obviously the negative net worth early in life is kids losing around $10,000 a year in value by going to college, but the truly depressing thing is that after that period, their net worth increases only by an average of about $5,000 a year.</p>
<p>That means they might have $5,000 more in the bank or $5,000 paid off of their student loans or $5,000 going to equity in a house, but no combination greater than that.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-this-happen">How does this happen?</h2>
<p>How is it that people alive in the period of the highest and most productive technology are working more than Medieval serfs?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it in simple terms by defining &ldquo;making it:&rdquo;</p>
<dl>
<dt>Making it:</dt>
<dd>Earning or having significantly more money than you spend or owe.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Or in pseudomath:</p>
<p><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">income - liabilities = comfortability</math></p>
<p>To increase comfortablity, you can increase your income or decrease your liabilities.
This is a simple equation.</p>
<p>By &ldquo;liabilities&rdquo; I mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>the cost of food you have to eat to live</li>
<li>the cost of the place you need to live</li>
<li>the payments for goods and services you actually need (power, or perhaps a car, etc.)</li>
<li>debts</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>problem</em> I would estimate is that people focus <strong>all of their time, money and interest on increasing their income and focus quite literally none on <em>decreasing</em> their liabilities</strong>, which is actually substantially easier anyway.</p>
<p>In fact, the modern economy, including all the bad advice it gives to people can generally be thought of a system that is desperatly trying to <em>increase</em> everyone&rsquo;s liabilities within it.
Financial libabilities, debt and others, breed even more financial liabilities.</p>
<h3 id="the-lifestory-of-basically-everyone-nowadays">The Lifestory of Basically Everyone Nowadays</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s illustrate this with the story of most people you know:</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the best college I can because everyone told me to.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I need to pay off my $40,000+ in student loans, so I need to move to the city and get a good job.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I get paid well, so I need a better car and other stuff to match.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I still have loan debt, car debt and now credit card debt, but now I have a good credit score, so I&rsquo;ll use all my savings to pay 20% of an expensive house I&rsquo;ll be paying off for 25 years.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Oh my boss wants me to humiliate myself for sodomy month or get the Coofid vaccine or the Mark of the Beast to keep my job. I have at least a quarter of a mil invested in my life here, so I can&rsquo;t just leave. Be realistic.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Yeah the economy is really bad and I lost a lot of investments. Either way, this is my career and what I&rsquo;m trained for. It&rsquo;d be hard to retrain. I made the right choices, I just got unlucky.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m 60 and it&rsquo;s time for retirement! Now that my body is broken I can start enjoying life!&rdquo;</li>
<li><em>*Dies of seed-oil-induced heart attack.*</em></li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;d be wrong to singularly blame student loans for all of this, but there is a tangible sense in which opening up any new massive monthly liability to the system encourages people to open up more to cover for it.</p>
<p>No one is ever told that this is the inevitable end of increasing liabilities: you need more and more liabilities.</p>
<h3 id="which-way-millennial">&ldquo;Which way Millennial?&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Millennials come in two financial categories: around 90% of them are extreme consoomers who cannot not spend every penny of their salaries on subscriptions, plastic toys and coffee and seem to view the fact they get calls from collections agencies as some unpreventable outcome of &ldquo;capitalism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other 10% are the exact opposite: they are contemplating living in the trunk of their 1990&rsquo;s Corolla parked in the parking lot of their job site so they can save 97% of their income.
When they plan on buying a house or getting married, they are quixotically salivating on how much money they can save on monthly bills.</p>
<h2 id="the-endgame">The Endgame</h2>
<p>I will go ahead and say, I consider the ideal not even to be rich, but to not need money to live a comfortable life because you have put yourself in a geographic and behavioral position where you can survive on as little as possible.</p>
<p>Either way, my mindset (as the second type of millennial) has always been &ldquo;How can I absolutely minimize the amount of money I need to live?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;What is the cheapest place to rent?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What is the cheapest-per-calorie real food for me to eat?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What &ldquo;needs&rdquo; are not really needs and can I go without?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>The implicit goal was to live on as little as possible: that&rsquo;s what actually maximizes your life&rsquo;s freedom.
If you can live on less than, say, $500 a month, even working as a part-time wagie, you will be plenty to pay bills, save a significant amount and have lots of free time.</p>
<p>For young single guys in computer science, this is especially ideal, since your hobbey/craft doesn&rsquo;t cost anything to tinker with.</p>
<p>In my late twenties, right before I bought my house, I was living in a college town with a monthly budget <strong>including my rent</strong> of around $400 ($300 was rent $100 was basically groceries). Probably went over that $100 most months, but never by much. This is also when I started <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/making-free-money-off-credit-cards">churning credit cards</a> to make a significant portion of my little expenditure back.</p>
<h2 id="behavioral-patterns-over-life">Behavioral Patterns over Life</h2>
<p>As you&rsquo;re saving money to buy/pay off a permanent dwelling place, most important is cultivating permanent behaviors that will reduce your need for money and &ldquo;the system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you take the &ldquo;high&rdquo;-income, high-liability route, you&rsquo;re going to be establishing wasteful antipatterns your early life and when you need to buckle down and root those out, it will be more difficult because it will be the egotistically trying task of going from showly and &ldquo;easy&rdquo; pleasure spending to a Spartan budget.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to have a solid foundation of low spending. I said in that video years ago on getting Trumpbux that all money you earn and spend should be directly weaponized to decrease your reliance on money. Property, tools, plants, skills. These are investments much more substantial than investing in boomer stocks because they lessen your need for money.</p>
<h3 id="worst-case-scenario">Worst Case Scenario</h3>
<p>As a passing remark, I&rsquo;ll add that the other benefit of focusing on minimizing liabilities is that it makes you significantly less reliant on &ldquo;the system&rdquo; and more robust in the case of disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Training&rdquo; to get a highly specific corporate job is not going to help you in all possible scenarios in the way that simple the simple craftsmanship of someone who fixes their own cars and things.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-07-16 16:10:08+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/minimizing-liabilities-is-making-it/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/minimizing-liabilities-is-making-it/</guid>
<item><title>![CDATA[The hardest technical solutions are right in front of your face.]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Nassim Taleb had this old anecdote of the sheer absurdity that while the suitcase and other bags had existed for lifetimes, it was only in the 1990&rsquo;s that people had the idea to put wheels on the things so they didn&rsquo;t have to haul them around airports all day with their strength.</p>
<p>It reminds you of the fact that while children in the Incan Empire did indeed have some toys with wheels, apparently no one thought to use the wheel to make a simple cart or wagon to use in town or on the Inca&rsquo;s extensive imperial roadways.</p>
<p>The proper response to hearing this should be the deserved angst that right now, there are make &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; technological improvements we could make to improve our lives significantly.
Even worse, in lieu of these simple and obvious solutions which have lain hidden in plain site for centuries, we have no doubt developed a lot of inefficient technology to fill in the gap.</p>
<p>Since I was recently doing <a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/w/oz4VV8SrnTEACCndxMASZH">tutorials on Hugo</a>, a static site generator, it&rsquo;s funny to think that through the 90&rsquo;s, no one really thought to invent a computationally simple static-site generator as they exist now.
People moved pretty much directly from manually edditing HTML files manually into massive proprietary WYSIWYG editors and web &ldquo;frameworks&rdquo; that regenerate web pages on every single visit.</p>
<p>This lack of vision and inability to see the simpler solution has largely produced the slow-loading, content-minimal web of today and the bizarre culture of modern &ldquo;webdevs&rdquo; whose diets consist in anti-patterns.</p>
<h2 id="the-shame-of-bitcoin">The shame of Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Recently there was <a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/w/7PZGdoF7WdpWVS1UDcwDFz">an interview released of me</a> at Monerotopia with the Crypto Vigilate team.
Unfortunately, the video cut off and doesn&rsquo;t have perhaps the best part which I now remember: our discussion on the possibility of &ldquo;obvious solutions&rdquo; that could conceivably replace proof-of-work in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, ultimately is a self-reinforcing behavioral Nash Equilibrium that uses the logic of proof-of-work mining to establish consensus while still remaining decentralized.
The thing is, anyone who is not a delusional fanboy has to look at proof-of-work as some kind of incredible weird and inefficient abomination.</p>
<p>To establish decentralized consensus, we have to have an increasing farm of the world&rsquo;s computers performing computations that do essentially nothing outside of &ldquo;secure the network.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no magic force in the universe that has ordained that the only possible way to establish decentralized consensus is Proof-of-Work.
Proof-of-stake is obviously an alternative to it, but one whose long-term game theoretic nature is still an issue of significant controversy.</p>
<p>Regardless, an alien civilization observing us might view the issue of decentralized consensus similar to how we view the Inca who never thought to use wheels to make carts.
It will be pretty absurd if most of the world&rsquo;s computing power will soon be dedicated to proof-of-work mining only for some bratty kid or jaded cryptographer to come up with an &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; other way to establish a self-reinforcing system that can verify decentralized consensus that doesn&rsquo;t require the waste.</p>
<h2 id="take-aways">Take-aways</h2>
<ol>
<li>Technological opportunities are not just everywhere, they are right in front of your face.</li>
<li>The fact that a solution is obvious and simple is not reason for ruling it out because &ldquo;Someone must have thought of that and tried it before.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Never be happy with technology that is inelegant just because there is no obvious alternative now.</li>

Support independent research and analysis by joining my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone 

I can’t trust anyone with my data. When I use a phone with a Google Account or Apple ID, these companies are by default going to be collect unique hardware identifiers, my location information and app usage data without possibility to opt out. 

If I want to use a phone I need to choose one that is going to allow me to use it completely anonymously and let me be in control of all of my data. I want to a phone that maintains Android’s security model and keeps the best security practices for security updates.

GrapheneOS has a far-reaching number of substantial improvements that altogether make up for the most secure mobile operating system for the end user. 

Because I want to keep this device as anonymous as possible, I do not even insert a SIM card at all and use the phone as a WiFi-only device. To protect my IP address, I use Orbot to route my traffic through Tor.

<item><title>![CDATA[The Splinternet | This Is How The Internet Dies]]</title><description>![CDATA[Support independent research and analysis by joining my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone 

Many academics are sounding alarms that the death of the unified global Internet is already happening. More and more countries are voicing their desire for digital sovereignty and techno-isolationism. 

Experts are worried this cyber-balkanization is creating a multi-verse of national Internets and corporate walled gardens that they refer to as the Splintertnet.

If Internet can be understood as a worldwide network of all networks, Splinternet would be the opposite of that. It is when nations stop participating in the ICANN consensus and begin assigning their own IP addresses. It is also when governments setup nationwide firewalls to restrict free flow of information to and from the country. Both of these trends are already well on their way to create the world’s first Splinternet.

<item><title>![CDATA[Overpopulation and the Mouse Metaverse]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>The world's population has sky-rocketed from under 1 billion to around 8 billion in only several hundred years? Should we be worried? Overpopulation has become a huge concern among TED talk enthusiasts and social engineer, but is it more than a meme?</p><p>We survey the classical views of population growth and its limits starting in Malthus's <dfn>Principle of Population</dfn> and how and why his assumptions have been overridden by technological development. Regardless, the 1960's saw a resurgence in Populational Control thinking and the "Zero Population Growth" movement, based in the popular work <dfn>The Population Bomb</dfn> by Paul Ehrlich, but also disputed by the optimistic Julian Simon.</p><p>Still, one of the more novel issues is that of Behavioral Sinks in modern societies: Industrial economies that are so well off that they population ceases wanting to reproduce or continue normal human life. Modern man is becoming more like the pampered rats in John B. Calhoun's famed Mouse Utopia experiments.</p><details>📚 See readings and other media.<p><em>Note that pay-walled academic articles may be obtained by feeding their URLs to sites like Sci-Hub.</em></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/sociology/1962-calhoun.pdf">The Mouse Population Sink &ndash; "Population Density and Social Pathology"</a> by John B.

Surveys have shown that around half of people report either their job is totally useless, or that it's unclear to them if there is any social benefit to their work whatsoever. How has this happened? Why do people put so much effort into what is, in effect, play work.</p><p>We talk about David Graeber's article, book and concept of <dfn>Bullshit Jobs</dfn>, jobs so inane that even the people working them can't justify their existence. This brings up economic questions of hyper-production, the Consoomerist economy, post-scarcity and of course the alleged panacea of Universal Basic Income (UBI).</p><p>At the root of all of it is a public-private plastic economy based on easy and highly inflationary money, which strips people of savings and keeps people working like good wagies from cradle to the grade on jobs that exist just to keep the fake economy going.

<item><title>![CDATA[Popper, Soros and the Open Society]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Karl Popper, known for his concept of <em>falsifiability</em> in the philosophy of science, also was a somewhat influential political thinker in his time. Popper endorsed what he called "the Open Society," a liberal democratic society based on abstract and depersonalized material connections, instead of direct social relationships.</p><p>This vision was particularly influential on one of Popper's now famous students, George Soros, who would go on to use his significant wealth won in financial markets to found the Open Society Foundation, a significant source of funds for leftist political agitation and pressure in America and Europe. Soros's worldview has somewhat departed from Popper's, with an emphasis on what Soros calls <em>reflexivity</em>, the principle that in human domains, our theories of world affect the world itself.</p><h1>More...</h1><ul><li>The <em>Not Related!</em> website: <a href="https://notrelated.xyz"></a>notrelated.xyz</a></li><li>Donations will be read in the middle of each episode: <a href="https://donate.notrelated.xyz">donate.notrelated.xyz</a></li></ul>]]</description><pubDate>2021-10-31 04:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://notrelated.xyz/audio/s02/S02E05_-_Popper_Soros_and_the_Open_Society.ogg</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://notrelated.xyz/audio/s02/S02E05_-_Popper_Soros_and_the_Open_Society.ogg</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Myth as Science and Prehistoric Knowledge: Hamlet's Mill]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Known history is less than 1% of the time humans have inhabited earth, and thus most of our past survives only in the partial evidence of myth, genetics and badly decayed archaeological remains. In particular, mythology is not just a collection of arbitrary stories, but as the authors of <em>Hamlet's Mill</em> argue, it is a long-lost theoretical language used to store astronomical and scientific knowledge.</p><p>While we all know that myth can store relevant information in a memorable format, it can also embed very specific details of a preexisting system of knowledge also attested in archaeoastronomy, even in well-known sites like Stonehenge, the "neolithic calculator" which shows astronomical knowledge far more precise than that of any average person of today.</p><p>The reason the earliest philosophical and religious mythology seems absurd or opaque to us is partially because it is speaking in a jargon which has been lost, like alchemy or primeval sciences. In the right context, we can see a long tradition of knowledge preserved from at least the Stone Age.</p><details>📚 See readings and other media.<p><em>Note that pay-walled academic articles may be obtained by feeding their URLs to sites like Sci-Hub.</em></p><ul><li><em>Hamlet's Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth</em> (Giorgio de Santillana &amp; Hertha von Dechend)</li><li><em>The Origins of Scientific Thought: from Anazimander to Proclus, 600 B.C. to 300 A.D.</em>  (Giorgio de Santillanna)</li><li><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/2021258a0">Stonehenge: A Neolithic Computer</a> (Gerald Hawkins)</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CdeBmQZ2QiCEnPQn5KQ6ov">Learn the Ancient Babylonian Math System!</a> (YouTube video series)</li></ul></details><h1>Timecodes</h1><pre>0:00:00	Issuing an Extension on Human Prehistory

<item><title>![CDATA[Obscenities are symptoms of weak minds.]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Over the past few years, I made the decision to totally cut obscenities
out from my speech. You might actually be able to find recordings of me
cursing four or five years ago, but as of now, I really stand by my
decision.</p>
<p>Obscenities are the linguistic equivalent of an trashy emaciated person
entirely decked in tattoos, smoking cigarettes and wearing a shirt with
nudity on it. They'll defend what they do on the idea that it's
someone &quot;their right,&quot; or &quot;expression,&quot; as if they do what they do
for some lofty philosophical reason. What everyone else sees is a person
who is not in control of themselves or their vices, in fact, someone who
views their vices as a good thing.</p>
<p>There's the atomistic and nihilistic tendency to give an
&quot;intellectual&quot; argument for obscenities: &quot;What's so special,&quot; the
argument goes, &quot;about obscenities in English? They're just a
combination of arbitrary sounds! They don't have some objective magical
harm in them.&quot;</p>
<p>But the &quot;arbitrary sounds&quot; in an obscenity do indeed have a special
place in human psychology. Obscenities are produced and processed in the
brain quite differently from non-obscene language, involving the more
animalistic/reptilian parts of the brain. When assembling a well-thought
out case, there is really never a temptation to litter it with curses.</p>
<p><strong>When a person curses, it's a direct indication that they are thinking
on a lower, more reactive, more emotional level.</strong></p>
<p>I get a lot of email every day and most I don't answer for time
constraints. I've gotten good at filtering out emails, and I have
realized that obscenities are one of the best indications of a low
quality content. I haven't gone so far as to totally block curse words
with Spam Assassin, but it is genuinely rare that I receive an email of
any quality with obscenities.</p>
<p>All of this is to say that obscenities are a great indication of
reactive thinking. When someone is cursing, he is thinking at least in
part like an animal. In deciding not to curse, I have decided to be
quiet first, then only evaluate things calmly afterwards.</p>
<p>For me, there is extra reason not to curse because I am in a position of
an exemplar for many people on the internet. The internet is full of
&quot;snarky&quot; people cursing profusely and creating the idea that all
&quot;famous&quot; people should be highly arrogant and emotional.</p>
<p>There might be times when it's proper for someone to react in righteous
anger, but those are in reality so rare as to only happen in
life-and-death situations. Instead, a lot of modern nihilism is becoming
just as emotionally transfixed on minor slights and imaginary problems,
thus one spews out curses as if one is fighting some kind of crusade.
This makes profuse cursers not only the type of people who are reactive
and hard to relate to, but indicates how disordered their priorities
are.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2021-09-03 00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/obscenities-are-symptoms-of-weak-minds/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/obscenities-are-symptoms-of-weak-minds/</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Every Web Browser Absolutely Sucks.]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>The title explains it all, you don't even have to read.</p>
<p>There are no good, even passable web browsers. None. Not a single one
even comes close.</p>
<p>The weird thing is this: <em>making a good browser should be easy!</em> Among
the existing web browsers, you could assemble all the parts necessary
for a passable (if not perfect) browser. No one has ever bothered to do
this, instead, people assembled 90% good stuff and 10% junk.</p>
<p>Here I will list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Features a <strong>passable</strong> browser must have.</li>
<li>Features a <strong>good</strong> browser must have.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, no browser out there has all the traits of even a passable
browser, but we might as well list them all here for the record.</p>
<h2 id="features-a-passable-browser-must-have">Features a <strong>Passable</strong> Browser must have.</h2>
<h3 id="it-must-actually-work-on-the-modern-web">It must actually work on the modern web.</h3>
<p>Sorry terminal browsers. lynx, w3m, you're out. There is some role for
you in scripting and dumping HTML email as standard output, but no can
get along using a terminal browser unless they are purposefully limiting
themselves to a very small segment of the modern web. I wish this
weren't the case, but it is.</p>
<p>Sorry also to niche independent browsers like Dillo. Nice concept, but
not usable. I don't think Dillo can even handle my simple modern CSS on
my website.</p>
<h3 id="free-and-open-source-software">Free and open source software.</h3>
<p>No reason to explain this. Absolutely insane to use a program to browse
the internet whose source code isn't publicly auditable.</p>
<h3 id="no-unsolicited-connections">No unsolicited connections.</h3>
<p>This will be <em>literally the easiest</em> point to comply with, but also the
rarest thing in browsers:</p>
<p>Don't automatically connect to Google.com or Brave.org or some stupid
start page or analytics page or Cloudflare or any other site on when I
open the browser or at anytime while browsing unless I type the address
in my URL bar.</p>
<p>Don't automatically connect to an &quot;autoupdate&quot; site, and especially
don't pull updates from it.</p>
<p>Don't send analytics. Don't <em>make</em> analytics. Actually, don't even
ask me if I want to opt in to &quot;bug reports,&quot; I don't. If something
breaks, I'll tell you.</p>
<p>If you want analytics, I want you to beg for it on an obscure Settings
page. Tell me your sob story about how it helps you get funding. And I
will <em>still</em> not give you analytics because I don't let my file
manager, email client, music player, video player, text editor or any
other random program monitor me for no reason, least of all will I allow
a browser, which often handles the most sensitive information.</p>
<p>It's a statement of just how bad the browser market is that this is
even something we're talking about.</p>
<h3 id="ad-blocking-must-come-with-the-browser">Ad-blocking must come with the browser.</h3>
<p>No one opens up a browser to view ads. This is just not why browsers
exist. No human in all of humanity has benefited from involuntary ads.
100% of people would be better off with browsers without ads, therefore,
a sensible browser should block ads.</p>
<p>This is no more controversial than saying that if you rent a server from
a company, it should come with sensible defaults, like an operating
system, a solid root password that a Chinese script-kiddy isn't going
to guess and maybe a firewall.</p>
<p>Ad-blocking must be universal, so should other sensible
&quot;add-ons&quot;/features. HTTPS everywhere is a sensible universal browser
feature as well. There are no places where using HTTP is preferrable to
using HTTPS if available. If there are reasons to ever use HTTP only or
to view ads, they are so rare as to hide them away in the Settings Menu.</p>
<p>Brave (Le Shill Lion) has at least done us the favor of blocking ads by
default (it also has HTTPS everywhere). Qutebrowser has a notional hosts
ad-blocker that allegedly blocks I guess some things, but you will still
get an add-full browsing experience. GNU Icecat has a lot of sensible
default add-ons (I forget if it blocks ads by default), but in truth,
only developers have any reasons to use bare browsers without
ad-blockers and other basic add-ons.</p>
<h3 id="basic-options">Basic options!</h3>
<p>How long has Google Chrome and its clones been around? A decade? Why has
literally no one in that period had a problem with the fact that none of
these browsers have an option <em>to not store history!</em></p>
<p>No, not Incognito mode, I want to keep cookies, but I don't want stupid
browsing history showing up whenever I start typing.</p>
<p>No, I don't just want you to not suggest previous sites, but still
store them all for some reason.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Firefox browsers at least have this basic option. Brave does
too. Ungoogled Chromium doesn't. Useless. I like that it doesn't send
my browsing history to Google and all, but I also don't want it
broadcasting it to the people over my shoulder when I type a url. I
honestly imagine that the mandatory &quot;we must keep history&quot; aspect of
Chrome is subtle social engineering. &quot;Oh you shouldn't have that
choice, you want everything you do to be stored for reference!&quot;</p>
<h4 id="internet-browser-history-is-really-obsolete">Internet browser history is really obsolete.</h4>
<p>For normies on the modern web, there is really less and less purpose of
browsing history with every passing year. In the better days of the
internet, back when <em>people actually browsed the internet</em> and you would
see dozens or hundreds of different websites a day, there is kind of a
use to a constant log of history, in case you vaguely remember seeing a
site, but couldn't remember how you got there and you couldn't search
because there were no search engines.</p>
<p>Web history is basically obsolete for 99% of people because:</p>
<ol>
<li>They use only Facebook or two other sites and quite simply never see
any of the rest of the internet.</li>
<li>Bookmarks exist and are widely used for the few sites people do use.</li>
<li>People can use a search engine to find a site.</li>
<li>They are daily watching porn or simping for instathots or doing
other abominable things for which they will be erasing their
internet history anyway.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="no-clutter-in-the-browser-experience-and-neutrality">No clutter in the browser experience and <em>Neutrality</em></h3>
<p>Brave. Lol.</p>
<p>I complimented Brave for adding ad-blockers to their browser by default.
The issue is that they also continually add more and more and more stuff
to their browser of extremely niche orientation in every single update.</p>
<p>Update Brave and there'll be some new Crypto gadget on the main screen
which is probably making some kind of unsolicited connections to
something or another. Brave has been dutiful enough to allow everything
to be disabled, but none of this is browsing related. I want a browser.
Stop giving me stuff that's not a browser. That's why I liked the idea
of the ad-block, but it looks like Brave will need a feature-block as
well.</p>
<p>Aside from Brave, about <em>every browser</em> from Pale Meme to unJewgled
Chromium has a distracting stupid start page that advertises your
history or suggests inane sites. When I open a fresh browser window,
unless I have specifically created an HTML page which I have set as my
homepage, I want to see a clean virgin page. I don't want to see giant
soy blocks that show a links to my bank account or the Bitchute
documentaries I was just watching. If I want to get there quick, I'll
bookmark it, thank you.</p>
<p>I want a browser to be <strong>neutral</strong>, not personalized. Or at least
<strong>neutral by default</strong>. I don't want it to advertise new features and
software. I don't want it to change when I visit a site.</p>
<h3 id="do-not-clutter-home">Do not clutter home!</h3>
<p>Browsers routinely make messes in home directories. XDG Compliance. Know
these directories:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>~/.config/</code> &ndash; for configuration files</li>
<li><code>~/.cache/</code> &ndash; for your cache</li>
<li><code>~/.local/share</code> &ndash; for share files</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where stuff goes so 100 useless folders don't clog up your home
when you <code>ls -a</code>. No one seems to have told this to browser developers.</p>
<p>Chromium browsers give you this useless <code>~/.pki/</code> directory. If you're
using a Furryfox clone, they are going to force at least <code>~/.mozilla/</code>
on you, but you'll also get something else. Installed Librewolf?
You'll get <code>~/.librewolf/</code> too.</p>
<p>I don't know how hardcoded Google and Mozilla made this annoyance, but
if you can deGoogle Chrome, you can use the proper XDG directories.</p>
<p>Dishonorable mention <em>definitely</em> goes to Pale Moon. Being an
independent browser, you would <em>think</em> they would jump at being less
annoying. Nope: <code>~/.Moonchild Productions</code> right in your home directory.
Capital letters and whitespace: a big eff-yew to Unix-based operating
systems. (I think they made this lower-case now?)</p>
<h3 id="must-be-written-in-a-sensible-language">Must be written in a sensible language.</h3>
<p>Aw, Dang!</p>
<p>Sorry, Qutebrowser, you thought you could make it all the way right?</p>
<p>Hey, that's okay, there are a lot of great aspects to being written in
Python: it's easier for people to play around with your config file and
script things into it, but let's be real: you're slow and buggy and
take way more system resources than a browser written in C or C++.
That's just not going to cut it for a mainstream browser that old
boomers are going to be watching YouTube and Netflix in with 250 other
open tabs.</p>
<p>Maybe if you were written in Go? Or maybe you could get compiled in
Cython or something? Idk, but as it is, it ain't cutting it.</p>
<p>Of course I realize that Qutebrowser does basically everything else
well. If I had a computer with more CPU power and RAM, I might use
Qutebrowser. It has gotten a lot better over the years.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="features-a-good-browser-must-have">Features a <strong>Good</strong> Browser must have.</h2>
<p>Now that we've ascended past the summits of the bare minimum, we might
as well discuss what additional features every browser should have.</p>
<h3 id="a-config-file">A config file.</h3>
<p>I don't care if only 2% of people know what a configuration file is,
you need one. You can keep your Settings menu for normies, but it's
nuts that browsers think it's okay to get by without a configuration
file.</p>
<p>Once someone has their browser configured, all they have to do if they
change computers or want to replicate their settings is to move one
file. Or for someone like me, who has <a href="https://larbs.xyz">people wanting to install my
system configuration a lot</a>, it would be convenient
to be able to have a single text message that assembles a browser with
sensible settings. You just can do that though. You can sorta-kinda do
that with some Furryfox settings, but for a Chromium browser, forget
about it.</p>
<p>Either way, there needs to be a simple text file that can handle setting
settings, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add-on lists including links to the source (similar to a vim plugin
manager)</li>
<li>Key bindings and custom shortcuts</li>
<li>Bookmarks</li>
<li>Search engine prefixes (combination of the two above).</li>
<li>Graphical settings, color appearance, organization of tabs and
buttons</li>
<li>Font, language</li>
</ul>
<p>Config files, even if 2% of people are going to use them now open up a
new world of sharable and editable settings. This will solve a lot of
tech support issues as well, frankly.</p>
<h3 id="actually">Actually...</h3>
<p>After the configuration file, every other feature a browser should have
comes for free. For example, it would be nice to get vim-like
key-bindings for mouseless browsing, but that is really dealt with
custom key-binds (and I suppose a link hint feature).</p>
<p>In general, I feel that once you have the sensible defaults above and
configuration file, you really have everything. Browsers suddenly become
programs with the same level of usability and customizability and
non-egregiousness of every other program on the computer.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A browser...</p>
<ol>
<li>Must actually work.</li>
<li>Must be free and open source software.</li>
<li>Must make no unsollicited connections.</li>
<li>Must block unsollicited ads and other sensible defaults.</li>
<li>Must have sensible options for history and cookies.</li>
<li>Must not be cluttered by features irrelevant to browsing.</li>
<li>Must not clutter the filesystem.</li>
<li>Must be written in a fast language light on system resources.</li>
<li>Must have a configuration file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tell me when a browser finally meets these requirements.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2021-08-28 00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/every-web-browser-absolutely-sucks/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/every-web-browser-absolutely-sucks/</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Modern "Freedom" Means Being a Slave to Impulses]]</title><description>![CDATA[<h2 id="what-does-freedom-mean">What does freedom mean?</h2>
<p>See this article in video form
<a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/modern-freedom-means-being-a-slave-to-impulses">here</a>.</p>
<p>Which of the following two people is more free:</p>
<ol>
<li>A drug addict.</li>
<li>A average man who is only not a drug addict because he lives in a
country where drugs are regulated or shamed in a way to make them
hard to obtain.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most modern people will have a kind of cognitive dissonance, a kind of
glitch in their matrix here. In the modern view of freedom, freedom
means the ability to do what you want without the government or society
telling you what to do, so (1), the drug addict, should be more
&quot;free.&quot;</p>
<p>But at the same time, this feels wrong. (2) probably lives a better
life. He is more suited to make more and better decisions. Someone
addicted to drugs is highly constrained in the kind of life they have to
live to fulfill their addiction.</p>
<p>Even extreme libertarians will probably say (2) is in a better place,
but might chalk things up to (1) needing to have more discipline and
they'll make up some just-so story as for why unambiguously bad drugs,
or pornography, or dangerous things should be allowed anyway.</p>
<h2 id="classical-freedom">Classical freedom</h2>

<figure class="resright"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/paul.jpg" /></figure>

<p>In reality, since the Enlightenment, we have had a hobbled understanding
of what &quot;freedom&quot; is. Enlightenment &quot;freedom&quot; is only the freedom to
perfectly follow the whims of impulses and vices indiscriminately.</p>
<h3 id="the-christian-tradition">The Christian tradition</h3>
<p>Christians stated the classical view of freedom very clearly. Paul
writes that all men are either &quot;slaves to Christ&quot; or &quot;slaves to
sin.&quot; The modern man wants to retort that he doesn't want to be a
slave to anything, but wants to be his own master, but there is really
no such thing.</p>
<p>One can be guided by Christ, or more generally, by consistent moral
principles, restraint and forethought. Or one can abandon the pretense
of morality and by definition follow his impulses to fornication,
substance-abuse, and general reckless living.</p>
<p>These masters aren't equivalent either. Being a slave to one is nothing
like being a slave to another. Slaves to sin are wrapped up into
incoherent and uncontrollable behavior. Following one's sexual whims
might be inconsistent and thoughtless behavior that one likes one second
and is disgusted by the next. It might mean someone exploding in rage
and emotion.</p>
<p>This &quot;free&quot; man, a slave to sin, is only bound by the practical
consideration that he might get caught or shamed by &quot;prudes&quot; and that
might dampen his ability to follow his inpulses more.</p>
<h3 id="impulses-are-not-the-man">Impulses are not the man</h3>

<figure class="titleimg"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/nihilism.jpg" /></figure>

<p>If we look at the modern world as if it has desires and goals for us, it
certainly seems like it is trying to induce as many people as possible
into being slave to sin. People no long have identity in who they
actually are, but in accidental preferences formed over years of
impulse-seeking: their sexual fetishes, drugs of choice, their favorite
TV show to consoom or their favorite music they constantly pump in their
head to dampen the possibility that an original reflective thought might
occur to them.</p>
<p>More than that, these people often can't even fathom of life without
their master sins, and retort in rage when someone dares to direct them
otherwise or &quot;judge&quot; them. They don't just have a kind of Stockholm
Syndrome with sin, but they can't comprehend the fact the people are
something deeper than their pleasure habits.</p>
<h3 id="control-of-impulses-leads-to-freedom">Control of Impulses Leads to Freedom</h3>
<p>However if one can constrain his impulses, he will be free to truly sit
down and deliberate and make free decisions on what is best to do.</p>
<p>This is where true freedom begins. The concept is totally alien to the
coomer, the slave to sin, because he can't even afford the mental space
to think further than his constant service to sin.</p>
<p>To him, it is merely &quot;me having fun,&quot; versus &quot;some haters who are
against fun.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="slaves-to-vices-are-slaves-in-general">Slaves to Vices are Slaves in General</h2>

<figure class="titleimg"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/fedora_consoomer.jpg" /></figure>

<p>If you indentify with your impulses, it's very easy to get you
motivated to defend them with the same impulsivity if you are told that
they are &quot;under attack.&quot; While impulsive people might be hard to be
around as individuals, they are easy to control as groups and can be
herded around like unthinking sheep.</p>
<p>People who are reactive in politics are always the losers, and what is
an impulsive life but one that is entirely reactive and therefore
controllable?</p>
<h2 id="the-kingly-state">The Kingly State</h2>
<p>With the classical understanding of freedom, the goal of social
conventions, traditional morality and the good government is to increase
true liberty by minimizing one's temptation to vice. People are born
with some tendency to vice (original sin to Chrisitians) that can be
easily made worse. The goal of normal society is to lead people away
from lasciviousness and impulsive behavior. (That is clearly not the
goal of the modern West, however.)</p>
<p>A drug addict is not free. A teenager who gets home from school
everyday, closes his door and watches internet pornography is not free.
A person who compulsively checks their social media feed when they wake
up or are minorly bored is not free. A woman who sleeps around
throughout her twenties and is left with nothing is not free. A boy who
stays up late because he has to &quot;grind&quot; on a video game is not free.</p>
<p>No one can say that these people truly want what they do: no one <em>fully</em>
consents to any impulsive behavior. This is actually why in the Catholic
tradition, sins of incontinence are not as grave as deliberate sins.
It's not a fair game.</p>
<p>Either way, the goal of the church, or a moral society and moral
government generally, is to increase freedom by being a countervailing
power to inborn vices.</p>
<p>The point of moral instruction is not to restrain man, but to make him
more free by eliminating the true causes of his enslavement: his vices,
his bad habits, his sexual paraphilias, his gluttony and greed.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2021-05-06 00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/modern-freedom-means-being-a-slave-to-impulses/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/modern-freedom-means-being-a-slave-to-impulses/</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Conspiratorial Thinking and "Multiple Outs"]]</title><description>![CDATA[<h2 id="how-to-do-magic-tricks">How to do magic tricks...</h2>
<p>Magicians have this concept called &quot;Multiple Outs.&quot; It's actually how
you can do simple magic tricks. Suppose you have a person pick a card
and say you will guess the suit of their card.</p>
<p>They pick a diamond card and announce it, and you tell them to check
underneath their chair to reveal a slip of paper that says, &quot;You will
pick a diamond card.&quot;</p>
<p>That might sound like a nice trick, but if they had picked a spade, you
have another piece of paper under the fruitbowl that says, &quot;You will
pick a spade.&quot; If they pick a club, you unbutton your shirt to reveal a
giant club written on your undershirt, etc.</p>
<p>In essence, for any possible outcomes, you have a response planned that
seems natural and predictive. This is one of the ways that magicians do
what they do, often with more complicated mechanisms.</p>
<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
<p>Multiple outs are actually real magic.</p>
<p>You've heard the expression &quot;hope for the best and plan for the
worst,&quot; but the concept of multiple outs is that one should be planning
for <em>all possible</em> outcomes, including those that you yourself might not
even anticipate now.</p>
<p>Every business plan should have multiple outs. Your major life decisions
should be planned with multiple outs. You should even tacitly plan dates
with multiple outs, so that unexpected events can be met with a
confident, perhaps even better replacements.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-outs-in-political-power">Multiple outs in political power</h2>
<p>Any longstanding group in political power is by the mere fact of their
survival sure to have mastered the sleight of hand of &quot;multiple outs.&quot;</p>
<p>This serves not only to continue in political power, but to cement their
power further by the appearance of inevitability. A ruler or ruling
class puts themselves in a position to benefit from any possible
occurrence: be ready even to use disaster to your benefit, as Obama's
chief of staff Rahm Emmanuel put it succinctly: &quot;You never let a
serious crisis go to waste.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="conspiracy">Conspiracy?</h3>
<p>People skeptical of the state sometimes devolve into thinking that every
major political event is in one way or another is planned in advance.
This is because they don't understand and apply the concept of multiple
outs. They see that their rulers are good at benefiting from any chaos
or unforeseen events, so assume these events must've been engineered.</p>
<p>Look at the corona virus: it's a great example of an event that has
hugely benefited a small elite: it has bankrupted small businesses in
favor of Amazon, destroyed churches and mom and pop stores in favor of
passively consooming digital infotainment from curated social media
sites and more. It is a rationalization of state location and contact
monitoring and things far beyond what anyone dreamed of. It was a
rationalization for sending out unsolicited ballots to unverified voter
rolls which had very obvious beneficiaries. It has produced a cult of
doomsday believers crying for the state to lock them in their houses and
make them wear fetishistic masks.</p>
<p>Seeing all this and asking who benefits, &quot;Cui bono?&quot; might lead you to
think that the whole thing was planned: perhaps the disease itself is
fake, or maybe it was real, but spread on purpose, or perhaps it was
engineered. You've probably seen stuff like this, and while I won't
dismiss this kind of thinking out of hand, it's unnecessary.</p>
<p>In reality, the ruling classes of the West have openly prepared to
benefit from a pandemic scenario. COVID19 was deemed &quot;closed enough&quot;
to a pandemic, and the momentum of the system took over. It's not even
that they <em>wanted it to happen</em>, but they were prepped to benefit from
it as a contingency plan if it might occur.</p>
<h3 id="the-conspiracy-rabbit-hole-and-the-omnipotent-cathedral">The Conspiracy Rabbit Hole and the Omnipotent Cathedral</h3>
<p>There are some people who see how the ruling class is in a position to
benefit from every school-shooting, police encounter, foreign
entanglement, dissident politician and everything else and thus assume
that everything they see must be arranged in advance. There is a logic
behind believing this: it does seem <em>way</em> to convenient for all of this
to happen at what retroactively seems to the best time, but this leads
people to the much more uneconomical idea that the System is so
omnipotent that it controls every event and every reaction to every
event.</p>
<p>In reality, our rulers just know how to use multiple outs. When you know
how to do that, it seems like you are always in control, and by nature,
people attribute a kind of magical power to you. All you have to do is
stay cool and play it off like you predicted it all.</p>
<h3 id="this-is-why-the-system-always-seem-to-win">This is why &quot;the System&quot; always seem to win.</h3>
<p><strong>The system knows how to play with multiple outs.</strong></p>
<p>There is a canned response, or at least a reasonably ad-libbed response,
for every event and every possible event. They are in a position of
antifragility and can gain from nearly any possible event. When they
can't, the media can at least throw enough mud on public perception to
inspire apathy or confusion.</p>
<p>There are certainly portions of the System which are &quot;conspiratorial.&quot;
Major news organizations usually coordinate on what editorial line to
publish, but in general, their entrenched power comes from a detached
ability to be flexible in new events.</p>
<p>The omnipotence and permanence of the Soystem is illusory. It comes from
that flexibility.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-outs-in-your-life">Multiple outs in your life</h2>
<p>Even aside from politics, it's important to behave yourself in a way
that allow yourself to have multiple outs. Business, social life, major
decisions and in everything else. Never tether yourself to one option;
that's when you lose. Have a smart response to co-opt anything that can
happen, no matter how good or bad.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2021-05-05 00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/conspiratorial-thinking-and-multiple-outs/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/conspiratorial-thinking-and-multiple-outs/</guid>
<item><title>![CDATA[The Problems with Utilitarianism]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>I originally wrote this essay in 2014 or 2015 in a Chinese buffet in
Athens, Georgia. I've changed some of it and am re-adding it here. I
talk about the issues with Utilitarianism and a bad book by Sam Harris.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</h2>
<p>At a dumb intuitive level, the &quot;ethical&quot; idea of
[Utilitarianism]{.dfn} in principle gets pretty close to what most
people reflexively want from social-political affairs: the greatest good
for the greatest number of people&mdash;who doesn't want that?</p>
<p>The problem is that that intuitive idea is <em>incoherent</em>. It sounds good,
but there's not really such a thing as &quot;the greatest good for the
greatest number of people.&quot; If there were, it wouldn't even be
actionable.</p>
<h2 id="maximizing">&quot;Maximizing&quot;</h2>
<p>So the first problem is one any mathematician will realize right off the
bat: it's rarely possible to maximize a function for two variables.</p>
<p>If we had the means, we could maximize (1) the amount of good in society
or (2) the number of people who feel that good, but nearly certainly not
both (if we can it's a bizarre coincidence).</p>
<p>It's sort of like saying you want to find a house with the highest
available altitude and the lowest available price; the highest house
might not have the lowest price and vice versa, the same way the way of
running society which maximizes happiness is nearly certainly not be the
way which maximizes all individuals' happiness.</p>
<p>There are some classic moral puzzles that bring this out: Let's say
there's a city where basically everyone is in absolute ecstasy, but
their ecstasy can only take place if one particular person in the city
is in intense and indescribable pain. Or to put it another way, to
maximize <em>my</em> happiness, we might need to make everyone in the world my
slave and allow me to rule as I please. Although this might maximize my
happiness, it might not maximize anyone else's (if it does however, we
might want to consider it).</p>
<h2 id="the-well-being-of-conscious-creatures">The Well-being of Conscious Creatures</h2>
<p>So I recently read Sam Harris's <em>The Moral Landscape</em> which is either a
failed attempt to bring Utilitarianism back to life or a misguided book
simply ignorant of what the problems with it were. I don't actually
recall Harris using the term &quot;utilitarianism,&quot; although that is really
just what he's arguing for.</p>
<p>Harris repeats one mantra basically every paragraph of the book: &quot;the
well-being of conscious creatures&mdash;the well-being of conscious
creatures&mdash;the well-being of conscious creatures.&quot; In addition to
being repetitive, the term is problematic for important reasons. So
Harris wants our Utilitarian engineers to maximize &quot;the well-being of
conscious creatures,&quot; but the problem is we can't <em>just add up</em>
enjoyment in the first place. There's no way of taking my enjoyment of
candy, subtracting the pain of a broken nose and adding/subtracting an
existential crisis or two.</p>
<p>Now his hope is eventually we'll understand the neurology of the brain
enough to do just that. I don't take Harris for a fool, and he <em>does</em>
have a Ph.D. in neuroscience (obviously I am being sarcastic), but I
think he's ignoring all the important problems either to appeal to a
public audience or just to convince himself. We <em>can</em> study the
neurology of feelings and get readings of neural activity, but objective
neural activity is certainly not subjective experience. Twice as much
neural activity doesn't mean &quot;twice&quot; the subjective experience.</p>
<p>We can no better look at brain activation to understand subjective
experience any better than we can look at the hot parts of a computer to
see what it's doing.</p>
<h3 id="you-cant-do-math-with-feelings">You can't do math with feelings</h3>
<p>Of course one of the problems of qualia/subjective experience is that
they are necessarily unquantifiable: imagine how you felt the last time
you got a present you really enjoyed&mdash;now imagine yourself feeling
exactly <em>twice</em> as happy&mdash;now <em>1.5</em> times as happy&mdash;now <em>100</em> times as
happy.</p>
<p>You can't do it, and even if you could, you couldn't compare that
experience with other experiences&mdash;you can't really understand what it
means to be as happy as you were sad a month ago, and that prevents us
from actually adding up your experiences into one number to be
maximized.</p>
<p>But again <em>even if we could</em> it would be impossible to add that number
up with someone else's experience. Humans have different subjective
experiences: caffeine affects me demonstrably different than other
people, but I can't quantify that; some people are more affected by
pain (to my understanding, women seem to have a neurology more
pain-prone than men), but how can we precisely relate the precise ratios
of every individual person?</p>
<p>And of course, although Harris wants to maximize &quot;the well-being of
<em>conscious creatures</em>,&quot; we have no <em>clue</em> what kinds of conscious
experiences define animal life, or how many animals are &quot;conscious&quot; in
any recognizable sense. As Thomas Nagel noted, we can't even begin to
imagine what it's like to be a bat, but to quantify their experiences
and compare them to our own? Forget about it!</p>
<p>Douglas Adams in his <em>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em> presented the
idea of a genetically engineered cow which not only was made to be able
to speak, but to enjoy the prospect of being eaten and encourage others
to kill and eat him. Experience itself is not some kind of thing arbiter
of morality. Pain, in fact, might be a negligible or incomplete guide to
what is not good. Children have to put up with being drug around to do
many things they don't enjoy. That doesn't mean some immorality in
anything.</p>
<p>The philosophical problems here are so endless as to make any kind of
objective application of Utilitarianism based on neuroscience far beyond
even fancy. I will be so bold as to say that this will simply never be
possible, regardless of what chips Elon Musk wants to put in your brain.</p>
<h3 id="to-repeat">To repeat:</h3>
<ul>
<li>We cannot quantify any particular feeling.</li>
<li>On top of that, we cannot compare the values of different feelings.</li>
<li>On top of that, we certainly not weigh the subjective feelings of
all humans or beasts against other humans' feelings.</li>
<li>On top of that, even if we could do that, we can't maximize for
utility in such a way to maximize all individual happiness and
collective happiness simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<p>Utilitarianism isn't just impossible, it's impossible every step of
the way.</p>
<p>To be clear, these are not technological problems that a future
totalitarian government might be able to &quot;solve.&quot; There really is no
coherent sense in which we can put a number to a certain feeling of
happiness and subtract from that another person's feeling of
unhappiness. Qualia are qualia. It's like subtracting the sound of an
airplane from the color blue.</p>
<h2 id="what-utilitarianism-really-is">What Utilitarianism really is</h2>
<p>Anyway, the tradition of Utilitarianism was always a failure, but it's
an interesting sign of the times. The Enlightenment was a time of some
(less than usually thought) scientific advancement and the idea was that
as we began to understand the nature of the body and the stars and
everything else, we could fully understand too human society.</p>
<p>Eventually we could engineer and control them all. But as fast as we
learn things about the world, even faster do complications arise and we
end up &quot;[restoring nature's] ultimate secrets to that obscurity, in
which they ever did and ever will remain&quot; in Hume's words.</p>
<p>The only really unfortunate thing is that the ruling class of the West
either doesn't know or does care. There's a cynical sense in which
they are attempting to re-engineer or &quot;Build Back Better®️&quot; the world
on Utilitarian principles where every decision is determined to be
acceptable by some centralized utilitarian calculus.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2021-05-05 00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/the-problems-with-utilitarianism/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/the-problems-with-utilitarianism/</guid>

<a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/videos/watch/8ba38c94-e8c2-421f-bb5f-47f4169fa804">videos</a>,
no serious cryptocurrency can function <strong>in real life</strong> which is not
also a <em>truly private</em> cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>By far, the most popular of all these is Monero, which has already
become the <em>de facto</em> currency of the dark web, but also of <em>all</em>
cryptocurrency users <em>who actually use cryptocurrency for purposes other
than a mere investment</em>.</p>
<p>Monero, however, is not actually the only private or pseudo-private
crypto-currency, and while I talked about its competitors in a recent
stream, I think it's worth putting in words for a reference.</p>
<h2 id="moneros-competitors">Monero's Competitors</h2>
<h3 id="zcash-is-trash">Zcash is Trash</h3>

<figure class="resright"><a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/zcashy_owned.png"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/zcashy_owned_small.png" /></a></figure>

<p><strong>Optional privacy is no privacy at all.</strong></p>
<p>Zcash (ZEC) is often shilled as a Monero replacement. On the surface it
actually sounds great and unambiguously better: it has a clever a
zero-knowledge proof technology called zk-SNARKs which can store and
prove transactions in the blockchain in a private way. zk-SNARKs are
generally superior to Monero's somewhat ragtag triad of ring
signatures + stealth addresses + ring CT to anonymize transactions and
they are more scalable.</p>
<p>zk-SNARK is short for &quot;Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument
of Knowledge.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Zero Knowledge &ndash; It is private.</li>
<li>Succinct &ndash; Referring to computation time.</li>
<li>Non-interactive &ndash; In some earlier implementations of the
technology, the interacting parties must exchange information and
negotiate in turns, while zk-SNARKs can occur instantaneously.</li>
</ul>
<p>Zcash, however, has two major problems, one substantial and one
accidental (in the Aristotelean sense).</p>
<p>The substantial problem is that zk-SNARKs <em>are not fully trustless</em>:
they require a trusted setup where public parameters are generated and
if not properly disposed of, the initial developers could use that
knowledge to produce infinite money without anyone knowing. This sort of
defeats the purpose of having a decentralized cryptocurrency and while
the rest of the currency is decentralized, that gaping hole certainly
isn't.</p>
<p>The accidental problem (or maybe <em>incidental</em> problem in modern English)
is that Zcash is only <em>optionally private</em>. The vast majority of ZEC
transactions are not &quot;shielded&quot; with the zk-SNARK technology, but are
as public as a Bitcoin transaction. <strong>This allows a third-party to
uncover the &quot;private&quot; transactions by a process of automatic process
of elimination.</strong></p>
<p>Zcash, while is created valuable technology, is simply not a private
currency and is not a valid competitor to Monero.</p>
<h3 id="pirate-chain">Pirate Chain</h3>
<p>Pirate Chain (ARRR) is a minor privacy coin that has mooned
significantly recently popping up from 30 cents to 14 dollars or so
(it's halved since I started writing this article though). Pirate Chain
uses the zk-SNARK technology, but unlike Zcash, uses it mandatorily
(with optional transparent transactions like Monero via the private view
key).</p>
<p>Pirate Chain has two big issues though. The first is what I mentioned
before: zk-SNARKs as they have been implemented in ZEC and ARRR are
<strong>not trustless</strong>. They require a setup in which theoretically, if the
public parameters of the system were known to some inside party, they
could print an infinite amount of the currency with absolutely no way
that any other people could know.</p>
<p>Even if you <em>trust</em> the Pirate Chain developers, Pirate has another
pretty undeniable problem: <strong>90% of ARRR has already been mined and is
in circulation!</strong> Yep, you heard that right: A minor niche alt-coin
which has existed for only three years was put together in such away
that now as big of a proportion of it has been mined as has been mined
of Bitcoin in over ten years!</p>
<p>That means that that 90% is highly aggregated in the wallets of the two
and a half people who knew of ARRR in this period, and anyone adding to
the market cap is mostly just contributing to these people's bags. Even
if Pirate Chain had great trustless technology (which is doesn't) it
has not been set up equitably, but in a way that enriches early adopters
to an extreme degree. Expect to get dumped on if you buy this stuff.</p>
<p>Honestly, if you want a better, more honest cryptocurrency, you could
just take the Pirate setup and give it a slower and more sane emission.
That would be a better choice than ARRR itself.</p>
<h3 id="monero--dogecoin--bitcoin--wownero">Monero + Dogecoin + Bitcoin = Wownero</h3>

<figure class="resright"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/nowow.jpg" /></figure>

<p><a href="https://wownero.org">website</a> &ndash; <a href="https://suchwow.xyz">meme site</a></p>
<p>Wownero is a joke currency. It's literally a fork of Monero with
Dogecoin aesthetics and some minor additions. Like Pirate Chain, it also
has surged significantly recently (from 2 or 3 cents to more than a
dollar&mdash;beating out Dogecoin as a pump-and-dump for sure).</p>
<p>Weirdly enough, Wownero is probably the best of the alternative privacy
coins that I've mentioned so far. It's trustless, unlike the zk-SNARK
coins, but also has some nice features.</p>
<p>It was created somewhat as a satirical response for another privacy
💩coin, MoneroV, which was just Monero with an initial coin offering and
forked from the same blockchain (which ruins the privacy of users on
both chains because it becomes easier to triangulate on when outputs are
actually spent).</p>
<p>Since Wownero is a &quot;joke,&quot; it actually has integrated new technology
and helpful additions <em>before</em> Monero has, since the Wownero developers
are doing it all fast and loose. Ironically, that can be good.</p>
<p>One principle division between Monero and Wownero is that Wownero is
more like Bitcoin in that it has a totally fixed supply, while Monero
has tail emission. Some people have criticized Monero for tail emission,
arguing that it is unnecessary and inflationary. I am not sold on either
side: the game theoretics of this has never truly played out, but
Wownero might actually be something to look into if you like Monero, but
think it's &quot;inflationary.&quot; Regardless, Wownero's whitepaper and
roadmap on their website are something that everyone should read and
take seriously.</p>
<p>Again, the currency is sort of a meme, but it is what it is. I decided
to start taking <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/crypto.html">Wownero donations</a> on my site a while
ago, just for fun.</p>
<h3 id="suterusu-and-the-suter-token">Suterusu and the Suter Token</h3>
<p><a href="https://suterusu.io/">website</a></p>
<p>Now the ideal private currency would have the simple and scalable
zk-SNARK technology implemented in a fair way and hopefully started in
some novel manner that is truly trustless. Suterusu is one potential
candidate for this kind of system. Behind it is a novel idea of
zk-conSNARKs which can be read about in their
<a href="https://github.com/suterusu-team/suterusu-documents/raw/master/Suterusu_whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a>,
their
<a href="https://github.com/suterusu-team/suterusu-documents/raw/master/Suterusu_yellowpaper%20V%200.2.pdf">yellowpaper</a>
and a document on <a href="https://github.com/suterusu-team/suterusu-documents/raw/master/Suterusu_architecture.pdf">Suterusu
architecture</a></p>
<p>This technology hasn't been extensively vetted, but it has the
potential to solve all the issues in privacy coins.</p>
<p>Suterusu isn't quite meant to be an analog of Monero. The token itself
is actually just an Ethereum token. In fact, this might be the
interesting part: Part of its system is that it can provide zk-conSNARK
shielding <em>to other currencies</em> that support smart contracts. You can
use Suter to transact with Ethereum privately, for example.</p>
<p>The Suterusu system, however is not perfect as far as I'm concerned. It
isn't a self-propelling decentralized system in the way that Bitcoin or
Monero is. That makes is regulatable and subject to human whim in a way
a cryptocurrency should not be. It is a designed system with dev taxes
and even <a href="https://medium.com/suterusu/regulation-compliance-of-suterusu-625abc752eb9">regulatory compliance that includes
blacklisting</a>.</p>
<h2 id="zk-snarks-vs-zk-starks">zk-SNARKs vs. zk-STARKs</h2>
<p>In addition to the zk-S<strong>N</strong>ARK system used in Zcash and Pirate, there
also exists zk-S<strong>T</strong>ARKs, which like zk-conSNARKs allow for a trustless
setup. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046.pdf">Whitepaper</a>.</p>
<p>To repeat, zk-SNARK stands for &quot;Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive
ARguments of Knowledge.&quot; zk-S<strong>T</strong>ARK stands for &quot;Zero Knowledge
<strong>Scalable Transparent</strong> ARguments of Knowledge.&quot; [Scalable]{.dfn}
because it scales better than zk-SNARKs and [transparent]{.dfn} because
it has a trustless setup.</p>
<p>I do not know of a currency project that uses this technology now. Like
zk-conSNARKs, it's only a couple years old.</p>
<h2 id="the-ideal-privacy-coin">The ideal privacy coin</h2>
<p>Would be one that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is actually private.</li>
<li>Is trustless.</li>
<li>Is highly scalable.</li>
<li>Is truly decentralized and unmanaged by a singular entity.</li>
<li>Has reasonably fair emission/mining schedule.</li>
</ol>
<p>Monero gets only half credit on 3, but full points on the rest. Wownero
is the same, although perhaps it should be taken less seriously as a
Doge-tier joke. Zcash fails on 1 and 2. Pirate Chain fails on 2 and 5.
Suterusu has great tech, but flounders on 4.</p>
<p>So the recipe for an ideal currency is here. It is one that implements
the zk-conSNARK technology of Suterusu or zk-STARKs (provided that such
technology is appropriately vetted), but does so in a way without
centralization, dev taxes and other self-refuting silliness.</p>
<p><strong>This ideal currency might just be Monero itself</strong>, to my understanding
Monero has contemplated integrating zk-STARKs as they become more
well-travelled. Such an addition, if it works, would drastically improve
the scalability of Monero even if it might require somewhat of an
overhaul.</p>

<item><title>![CDATA[YouTube Channel Deletion]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Google is prepping to delete my YouTube channel. As of today (March 26,
2021), I now cannot post for another two weeks. YouTube &quot;strikes&quot;
which are functionally unappealable (automatically rejected) last for 3
months. If they give thee concurrent strikes, you channel is permanently
deleted.</p>
<p>If YouTube Jannies delete my YouTube channel, remember that <strong>100% of my
videos are still easily viewable, including new videos I will make</strong>.
You have no excuse to whine if all you know how to do is consoooming

<p>I can and have already done livestreams on

LBRY/Odysee will probably have livestreams too soon.</p>
<h2 id="when-youre-banned-from-youtube-will-you-keep-making-videos">&quot;When you're banned from YouTube will you keep making videos?&quot;</h2>
<p>Yes, at <a href="https://odysee.com/@Luke:7">Odysee</a> and
<a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz">PeerTube</a>. I will also probably actually
bring back <a href="https://notrelated.xyz">Not Related!</a> for real this time
because the first reason I made a podcast was to communicate with people
using less bandwidth.</p>
<p>I suppose my only regret is not shilling RSS, webrings and other
classical internet technology to free us from social media companies.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-youtube">The &quot;importance&quot; of YouTube</h2>
<p>YouTube ad revenue by itself is a nice thing to have, but it is not a
huge loss if I lose it (less than minimum wagies make). Very few
megachannels actually make decent money on it and frankly, it's a kind
of bloodmoney if you ask me.</p>
<p>The only concern for me is that YouTube is still the vehicle by which
people find out about me and use other stuff I offer and that can mean
other sources of income for me.</p>
<p>While I try to push people into a decentralized internet, use RSS feeds,
superior platforms like Odysee and PeerTube, and encourage them to have
websites and the like, most people still passively use YouTube
recommendations and curation.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-they-giving-you-strikes-for">&quot;What are they giving you strikes for?&quot;</h2>
<p>To be clear, before this year, I never received any strikes, but now
I've received a warning and two strikes <em>all for old videos</em>.</p>
<p>I will emphasize that this is merely the sign of either: (1) coordinated
third-party mass-reports or (2) YouTube specifically and arbitrarily
adopting new standards in a bid to remove the channel.</p>
<p>The strikes are for the following very innocent videos:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a video I put up in either 2016 or 2017 where I made an ffmpeg
slideshow with a bunch of Pepe memes set to music. Deleted for
&quot;inciting violence.&quot; I can't find the original video of this, I
might've deleted it.</li>
<li>For a video I did sometime in 2020 when I in passing made jokes
about low-quality Indian tech channels that used to dominate
YouTube. Deleted for &quot;inciting violence.&quot;
<a href="https://odysee.com/@Luke:7/thanks-luke-for-vanquishing-pajeettube:f">Here</a>
is the video so you can see how innocuous (also true) it was.</li>
<li>For a video I made maybe in 2018 or 2019 on <code>youtube-dl</code>.
<a href="https://odysee.com/@Luke:7/downloading-videos-music-and-more-with:5">Here</a>
is the video. The absurdity is that I recommend people to use this
tool to back up my YouTube channel (and all of my videos are in
licensed permissively via Creative Commons). I guess it's a crime
to distribute my own videos on a video distribution platform!</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the arbitrariness of Google today. If my channel survives the
storm of these strikes (which I severely doubt) expect me to be using
<a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz">PeerTube</a> and
<a href="https://odysee.com/@Luke:7">Odysee</a> as primary platforms. From now on,
my YouTube exists to lead people to more healthy places.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2021-03-26 00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/updates/deletion/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/updates/deletion/</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Veganism Is the Pinnacle of Bugmanism]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>People have quoted me as saying that. I forget where it comes from,
probably a livestream, but I definitely stand by it. Since a lot of
people labor under the assumption that my channel is about &quot;Linux,&quot;
I've accumulated a lot of subscribers that are variously nerds,
furries, degenerates, coomers, libertarians, communists, trannies and
among them are vegans. Some of them (I assume) are good people.</p>
<p>There's a stereotype about vegans that they are annoying and can't
talk about anything but Veganism. This hurtful stereotype comes from the
fact that it's true.</p>

<figure class="resright"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/grill.gif" title="I just wanna grill!" /></figure>

<h2 id="bugmanism">Bugmanism</h2>
<p>Firstly, what is Bugmanism? How do Vegans fit the bill?</p>
<p>Long story short, a bugman is someone who rejects the purpose and role
of humans in their natural environment. They reject tradition, religion,
their family, gender roles, the expectation that a person should
contribute to their community, etc. They might do this for their
personal convenience (usually they just wanna coom outside of marriage)
or for apparently rational reasons, but the effect is the same.</p>
<p>If you want to sum up the esoterically evil goals of &quot;modernism&quot; or
whatever you want to call it, it is destroying the countervailing power
of tradition and in its place, new social engineers attempt to dictate
human values top down. If you separate people from their families, their
races, their traditions and <em>who they actually are</em>, you can engineer TV
shows, sports teams, activist movements and a million other things for
them to identify with and worship. <strong>Modernism pretends to liberate
people from arbitrary traditions and authorities, when in reality is
substitutes natural, emergent morals with controlled authorities.</strong></p>
<p>Veganism has always been one of the most radical examples of this logic.
Esoterically, <strong>Veganism forces one to abandon not just their own
traditions, but every human dietary tradition</strong> and leaves them at the
whims of processed grains and pharmaceutical supplements for a meager
survival.</p>
<p>That is, Veganism is highly disruptive: You can't have a normal life.
You can't have a normal meal. You can't wine and dine with people and
must make it an affair. You can't use traditional hand-made leather
products. You can't hunt or trap for food or raise animals, even for
eggs.</p>
<p>You become a nag at war with your family, the world around you. <strong>You
are trapped</strong> <em>within</em> urbanite bugman society: you can't even eat in
most non-urban places or foreign countries because the insane concept of
not cooking with animal fats and eating and using animal products just
doesn't exist. You have to survive holding your breath from one hipster
downtown area to the next.</p>
<p>On every point, you become more reliant on macro-society. Vegans try
very hard to give off &quot;organic&quot; vibes, but it's just a lie. Even
people on the internet who &quot;advertise&quot; their Vegan lifestyle spend
hours processing a basic meal and of course predigesting indigestible
plant matter with a blender. Try and find a non-urbanite Vegan in real
life. They exist, but they are an aberration.</p>
<h2 id="the-larp-of-vegan-for-health">The LARP of &quot;Vegan for Health&quot;</h2>
<p>Vegans sometimes pretend to advertise Veganism because it's allegedly
healthy. This is just public relations; any true Vegan, when you really
pin them down thinks that Veganism at its core is a moralistic belief.
Vegans are Vegans because they believe that not being Vegan is morally
deficient: killing/eating animals and using their bodies is bad. That's
it.</p>
<p>So you have your moral principle and run with it. What magical force
then is making that moral principle necessarily good for your health? If
Veganism <em>were</em> actually a good diet for humans, that would actually be
a massive coincidence. &quot;Vegans for health&quot; have to grapple with the
bizarre claim that meat, exactly the food that has been viewed in all
human cultures as superior and more desirable is somehow nutritionally
deficient.</p>
<h3 id="the-standard-american-diet-sad-is-plant-based">The Standard American Diet (SAD) is Plant-based.</h3>
<p>The weirdest thing is when Veganism is held in opposition to the
Standard American Diet, as if the American diet somehow represents
traditional or non-Vegan diets. <strong>The SAD is just Vegan-lite.</strong> SAD is a
post-Vegan invention of the diet industry take over the past decades has
been leading people into the most harmful parts of vegan diets: unstable
plant-oils, processed grains as meat substitutes, etc.</p>
<p>The pop-cultural idea of &quot;health&quot; is simply &quot;being skinny.&quot; Veganism
is <em>great</em> at making people skinny because it is slow moving starvation
(I have met some carbo-loading exceptions who fatten up).</p>
<p>Veganism is just to starvation what waterboarding is to drowning. If you
stick with it, you <em>will</em> eventually die, but it's so painful in the
meantime, you'll probably give up.</p>
<h2 id="veganism-is-rational">Veganism is rational.</h2>
<p>Vegans are exceptionally &quot;rational&quot; in that they adopt the moral
framework of modern society and follow it to its logical conclusion.</p>
<p>When you're given for your acceptance some inane religious platitudes
like &quot;equality&quot; and &quot;rights&quot; along with vaguely Marxist notions of
&quot;exploitation&quot; and &quot;slavery&quot; and &quot;oppressed classes,&quot; it seems
perfectly reasonable to expand that language to the relationship between
predators (humans) and their prey (many animals) (or maybe pets too).</p>
<p>If you're raised in a time of extreme moral nihilism except for not
liking the several historical events you're told that matter (usually
slavery and the Holocaust), obviously you're going to glom on to what
looks most like them: chickens in chains and sheep being led to
slaughter like sheep to slaughter.</p>
<p>Honestly, Veganism by their own logic might not be far enough. There is
some circumstantial research to the effect that plants have nervous
systems that might feel pain as well: you could go one step further and
simply eat nothing living. The [Ctistae]{.dfn} of ancient Thrace refused
to eat anything alive, eating only by-products/foodstuffs like milk and
honey. The Ctistae also refused to have sex, which might be something to
consider since Vegans eventually lose sexual function anyway.</p>
<h2 id="veganism-is-rebellious">Veganism is rebellious.</h2>
<p>Veganism has the same kind of &quot;rebellion&quot; that all other forms of
leftism share. It &quot;rebels&quot; against the system by perfectly
internalizing the system's values, extrapolating them to their logical
conclusions and thus fighting the system when it fails to meet those
obviously unworkable conclusions.</p>
<p>Corporations started shilling vegetable oils (which originally were and
frankly still are just industrial by-products) as workable replacements
for butter and lard. Seventh-Day Adventists lobbied for them because of
their own religion beliefs. Jews lobbied for them because they hate
unkosher lard. Years later, now we know that vegetable oils are highly
unstable and have contributed to the massive rise in heart disease.</p>
<p>Veganism is a leftist phenomenon. The psychological type of a leftist is
such that they will always subordinate their direct experience to
ideology. It doesn't matter if not eating meat or wearing leather or
using animal products sounds hard, their suffering is more proof of a
greater moral superiority.</p>
<p>Non-leftists can simply not become Vegans for longer than extremely
brief periods. Even if a Vegan wins an argument with them, a normal
person is just going to say, &quot;I'm sorry, I like animals and all, but I
can't not eat them, that's just crazy.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="veganism-only-makes-sense-in-a-bugman-environment">Veganism only makes sense in a bugman environment.</h2>
<p>Ask a vegan why he doesn't eat eggs. He will probably tell you a spooky
story about how terrible it must be for a chicken to live in a coop
laying eggs all day. That might even bring a tear to a sentimental
person's eye.</p>
<p>Out where I live, people have their chickens wandering in their yards
and garden pecking scraps. They return to their coops at night to be
safe from coyotes. Is there really something &quot;unethical&quot; in the mind
of a Vegan about picking up an unfertilized egg lain by one of these
chickens and eating it?</p>
<p>A lot of the moral logic behind Veganism falls flat outside of bugman
capitalism. Fundamentally, it's another manifestation of general angst
from lack of connection to the real natural world.</p>
<p>I say this because most Vegans are Vegans because they are softies who
have literally no connection to animals whatsoever until as a teenager
they watched a PETA documentary with chickens getting their heads buzzed
off or pigs walking around in their own poop.</p>
<p>Literally think about the animals. When wild animals die in nature, they
don't slowly slip away in the night surrounded by their family. They
die of starvation, or by being ripped apart alive by packs of coyotes.
Would you rather die by getting your brains blown out instantaneously or
die a &quot;natural&quot; death <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg9_ZnojxmU">like
this</a>?</p>
<p>But to the original question, it really makes no sense even for a Vegan
to not eat or distribute the eggs a chicken lays... You're going to
have to get deep into Marxist analysis to think that's somehow
unethical. And once a chicken has living a long life of egg laying, why
not quickly and painlessly <a href="https://poultrykeeper.com/general-chickens/how-to-kill-a-chicken/">dislocate its
neck</a>
and eat it for dinner? If you don't, your cat will eventually gore it
and it'll be a mess.</p>

<figure class="resright"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/kill_chicken.gif" title="Boomer attempts to kill chicken." /></figure>

<h2 id="animals-live-to-be-eaten">Animals live to be eaten.</h2>
<p>This isn't even a metaphysical claim. Domesticated cows and pigs and
chickens do not and cannot live as they exist in the wild. They have
evolved symbiotically with us as sources of food. They can go feral and
breed with wild boar and the like, but their composition is based on
their domesticated state.</p>
<p>Wild game like deer have lived alongside human hunters for centuries.
Their breeding habits and evolutionary development is based in the fact
that a <a href="http://archive.jsonline.com/sports/outdoors/study-sheds-light-on-top-causes-of-deer-mortality-b99190938z1-241992741.html">sizeable
portion</a>
of their population will be hunted by humans every season.</p>
<p>If you actually care about &quot;the environment&quot; (1) you would care for
humans, whose natural diet is meat and (2) you would be terribly worried
about the unintended consequences of severing one of the most important
links in the food chain.</p>
<h2 id="dumb-vegan-sayings">Dumb Vegan sayings</h2>
<h3 id="you-wouldnt-kill-it-yourself">&quot;You wouldn't kill it yourself!&quot;</h3>
<p>They say this whenever someone turns their eyes away from an animal
being killed in one of their Vegan propaganda videos.</p>
<p>Guess what, I also might turn away if I see a video of a sanitation
worker wading through human feces it in a sewer. That doesn't mean that
I'm a hypocrite for taking dumps in a toilet connected to city sewage.</p>
<p>I turn away when I see depictions of amputations of gangrenous limbs in
movies too. That doesn't mean I don't think it's not medically
necessary.</p>
<p>Killing animals is actually a bad example of this because while all
cultures are disgusted by feces and amputations, in most times and
places (including this country before Bambi), killing animals was
nothing any self-respecting grown man would react to. It goes without
saying that there are many countries where people recreationally torture
dogs and cats.</p>
<p>I don't say that to say that I'd be okay with killing dogs and cats,
merely that the trained moral responses we have for them are very
localized and subjective in our own modernist viewpoint. But Millenials
have now been raised in a Disney fantasy-land where animals think and
talk like us and therefore must share the same feelings. Vegans absurdly
&quot;imagine what it'd be like&quot; to live in industrial farming as if a
chicken's birdbrain is having an existential crisis while living in a
cage.</p>
<h3 id="veganism-is-minimal-or-more-self-sufficient">&quot;Veganism is minimal or more self-sufficient.&quot;</h3>
<p>Vegans have been fruitlessly trying to meme this one on me for forever.
Starvation and death is minimal, I suppose, so it is at least true in
that sense. <strong>Veganism is ultimately the diet of only eating inedible
garnish that looks &quot;good&quot; on Instagram.</strong></p>
<p>Raising most animals is easier and more efficient than raising
vegetables. If it's too hot, potatoes don't naturally know to go move
to the shade. Yams don't eat your overgrown grass. Onions don't poop
out fertilizer. Tomatoes can't pull a simple tractor. You can't skin
dead okra and make leather out of it. You can't grind up old mustard to
make bonemeal (that's not just something in Minecraft, by the way).</p>
<p>Animals are an absolutely necessary portion of any homestead in life and
death. Listen, I like growing stuff. I like growing vegetables. But
vegetables are just not real food... They are garnish. They are sides.
They are only enjoyable insofar as they elevate your enjoyment of real
food: meat.</p>
<h3 id="veganism-is-more-efficient-or-environmental">&quot;Veganism is more efficient or environmental.&quot;</h3>
<p>People say that eating plants is more &quot;efficient&quot; because they saw an
energy pyramid diagram as a kid, which shows how many prey animals are
needed to maintain carnivorous animals. If we actually lived in a place
where there was a calorie shortage, like a desert planet where greens
couldn't grow, that might be an issue. It frankly just isn't here.
We're not exactly running out of grass to feed cows. Most people are
mowing their grass and throwing it away.</p>
<p>There are people who make really absurd environmentalist arguments
against meat as well, for example, methane from cows warms the globe.
Okay. Fine. So what does Veganism do about that? Are Vegans going to
kill the cows for us? Should we just let them starve in the woods since
we can't harvest them for meat or even milk? What about all the game we
won't be hunting? Those 50% of deer annually that we won't be
killing&mdash;won't they me causing pollution with the huge amount of
calories they need to frolic in the woods all days? Same will all other
game. Most of those arguments are cute just-so stories and they fall
apart after examination. Anyone can play that game.</p>
<h2 id="lets-just-laugh-at-this-for-a-minute">Let's just laugh at this for a minute...</h2>
<p>Alright class, look at this commonly posted vegan meme and tell me why
it's retarded:</p>

<figure class="titleimg"><a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/vegan_protein.jpeg"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/vegan_protein.jpeg" /></a></figure>

<p>&quot;Per 100 calories&quot; shows a deception so insane you should laugh.
Whoever made this image wants you to <em>believe</em> that the piece of steak
on the fork is equivalent to the tiny broccoli head on the right.</p>
<p>You can compare the nutrition of both
<a href="https://www.calorieking.com/us/en/foods/f/calories-in-fresh-or-dried-vegetables-broccoli-raw/uhZAljTASPuU9YnkyCZdFA">broccoli</a>
and
<a href="https://www.calorieking.com/us/en/foods/f/calories-in-beef-ground-beef-80-lean-20-fat-pan-browned/MJPo9HnUSnGiV2-9eBsCBw">beef</a>
at those links yourself.</p>
<p><strong>In order to get the protein in a single large bite of steak, you'll
have to eat more than half a pound of broccoli.</strong> Good luck. Now you
know why those poor impressionable girls who go vegan bloat up. And
that's only 100 calories. 2000 calorie diet? Have fun. If you're
famished, it's pretty easy to eat a big steak with 2000 calories
(around a pound and a half of matter) and it will fill you up without
any bloating or stomach pains. You'd have to eat <em>twelve pounds</em> more
or less of broccoli or equivalent greens for that. And with all that
fiber, you're going to just be pooping it all out.</p>
<p>Honestly, the human disgust response will stop you way before that.
It's easy to eat a juicy steak without or without sauce, salt and
pepper, but you'd nearly have to put a gun to someone's head to make
them eat their daily 13 pounds of indigestible garnish.</p>
<h2 id="noootruits-dont-actually-matter-anyway">Noootruits don't actually matter anyway</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Plants don't have over fifteen micro-nooootrients...&quot;
&mdash;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGenreDoesntMatter">sv3rige</a>, at
the end of every video</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of Vegan autism gets focused on replicating the consumption of
known nutrients and minerals using only plants. The image above, in
addition to being deceptive is based on a flawed idea that human
nutruition is about <em>consuming particular amounts of particular
substances</em> as if we are a perfectly predictable machine or a videogame.
This <strong>isn't just a Vegan problem</strong>, basically everyone implicitly has
this idea.</p>
<p>The reality is that those nutrients on the Nutrition Facts are a narrow
realm of what might actually be relevant for the complex organ of our
bodies. Additionally, there are many types of proteins and vitamins and
minerals that the back-of-the-box doesn't account for. The Vegan game
of saying, &quot;we can get that too&quot; is utterly pointless when you realize
we have nowhere close to a full idea of how the human body works, only
some plausible theories about the relationships between certain
nutrients and what they seem to do. As in the case of some nutrients,
like the falsely-maligned cholesterol is a good example of something two
generations of people were told to fear and reduce only for us to later
realize that our ideas about how it interacted in the body were arguably
literally backwards.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2021-02-11 00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/veganism-is-the-pinnacle-of-bugmanism/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/veganism-is-the-pinnacle-of-bugmanism/</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Why It's Bad to Have High GDP]]</title><description>![CDATA[<h2 id="to-put-it-in-other-words">To put it in other words...</h2>
<p>The common way of looking at Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is that it's
a metric of economic success: more GDP is more wealth. Wealth is good.
&quot;Poverty&quot; (meaning low <em>per capita</em> GDP) is bad. Nowadays, pretty much
everyone talks about &quot;economics&quot; like this as if this truism was
scribbled on the back walls of the cosmos.</p>
<p>This is just looking at one side of the ledger in a kind of global
double-entry accounting book. A logically equivalent way of looking at
it is that <strong>GDP is a metric of economic exchange required for survival
in society as it exists</strong>. You can say that some area &quot;produced&quot; $1
billion of output (sounds good), but you can just as easily say that $1
billion was required for that area to sustain itself (sounds bad). These
two are simply logically equivalent.</p>
<h2 id="living-on-1-a-day">Living on $1 a day</h2>

<figure class="resright"><a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/ivanov01.jpg"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/ivanov01s.jpg" title="(((They))) don't want you to know about this." /></a><figcaption>Antediluvian Hyperborea. GDP: $0 per year.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Let's dive into the Gestalt: when you hear that a family of eight lives
on less than a dollar per day (PPP adjusted), you might wonder how they
manage! To <em>actually</em> do such a thing would require buying large bags of
rice for the whole family, eat only that and live in free cardboard
boxes.</p>
<p>The reality is that that often uttered phrase means that they use less
than $1 a day in the general economy, while the rest of their
livelihood is &quot;off-the-grid&quot; or self-sufficient. They may grow food in
a family farm, hunt for food, and most of their daily needs from cooking
oils, to plates, to pottery, to soap are often made at home as well.</p>
<p>There is still &quot;an economy&quot; but often one that is barter based or
<em>socialist</em> in the real pre-socialist sense of the word: mediated by
direct face-to-face social tit-for-tat between neighbors and friends,
none of this mediated by currency being exchanged, thus it is not part
of the GDP.</p>
<p>If you read about some Bangladeshi village where the only product is
&quot;textiles&quot;, that doesn't mean that everyone there makes textiles all
day and, without a textile company, everyone would've starved to death.
It means that the only on-paper, measurable global industry practiced
there is textile manufacturing. Other villagers might farm, hunt, even
do some kind of gathering in some places. They will produce the arts and
crafts and live the way people live when you leave them alone. If your
view of the world is mediated by GDP, you're only seeing the extremely
small sliver that pops into existence when people exchange something
involving legal tender.</p>
<p>This is extremely difficult for us modern bugpeople to understand
because to be a bugman in a large city is to produce absolutely nothing
on one's own and buy literally everything you need from the store. To
us non-productive people, GDP means income which means survival. But the
further out of Bugmanville you go, the clearer the vacuousness of GDP
becomes. When you realize that most of human wealth is unmeasured by
GDP, you realize that Whig History and Steven Pinkerism is based on
shaky foundations.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>A minor example. We had a large Thanksgiving feast near my uncle's
house in very rural Florida. As it got cold in the night, we had a fire
in a repurposed old sugar cane cooking vat artfully standing on used
symmetrical cinderblock pieces. A bugman hipster might pay two hundred
dollars or more for a similar looking &quot;authentic&quot; piece of equipment.
Those $200 would be counted in the GDP. A bugman hipster might have
also bought or rented chairs for the event, &quot;contributing&quot; more to the
GDP, but my uncle, as part of the local wholesome church community,
simply borrowed some from the church. Thus our event produced basically
no GDP output in goods or services, despite being functionally
equivalent to some similar but expensive and ergo &quot;productive&quot;
&quot;Friendsgiving&quot; practiced by urbanites. In reality <em>we</em> are richer
than the bugmen hipsters who blew hundreds of dollars on a faux-folksy
party. In this case, we owned the firepit and had easy access and
permission to the chairs, thus we are more economically flexible than
they are. That GDP that they produced/expended is evidence of deeper
reliance on the economic system. That GDP output is a marker of
<em>fragility</em>, reliance on the conditions of the outside economy in the
same way that a village of Bangladeshis who abandon their traditional
way of lives to work on textiles are more fragile, despite being able to
save up for iPhones.</p>
<h2 id="what-gdp-really-measures">What GDP really measures</h2>
<p><strong>Most of the increase in GDP across the world is simply the movement
from local partially-social partially-under-the-table economies to
economies mediated by taxable currency.</strong> An economically
self-sufficient village with close social relationships and a barter
economy has 0 GDP. A township of entrepreneurs and artisans you
partially barter and partially use currency which they don't report has
0 GDP. All of these people are &quot;in poverty&quot; and &quot;earn less than a
dollar a day&quot;. And if you want to be truly self-sufficient, that means
having a personal GDP of zero.</p>
<p>More than that, pretty much everywhere, GDP is a strong indicator of
social upheaval. If you think that GDP is some eternal goodness,
remember that <em>everything &quot;good&quot; about industrialization shows up in
the GDP</em>, while at the same time, <em>everything bad about it will not show
up</em>. Or, sometimes bad things are registered as positive economic
growth: urbanization has caused mass-disease, and if that means a market
for new medical services and pharmaceuticals, great! The GDP just went
up! The Ganges is polluted due to the textile plant? That just means
more opportunities for local entrepreneurs to sell bottled water! The
GDP just went up! Are people being pushed out of fishing or other
subsistence occupations because of it? Even better! Now they have no
choice but to contribute to the GDP! With every passing year, in fact,
more and more of the GDP is produced by dealing with the problems that
our higher level of GDP have caused.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, <strong>GDP is only a measurement of how reliant a
place or country is on the global economy</strong>. Self-sufficiency has a GDP
of 0. Wasteful consooomerism has an extremely large GDP.</p>
<h2 id="planned-obsolescence">Planned obsolescence</h2>
<p>I have one of my great grandfather's early electric circular saws. It
has a bunch of gunk in it, but it still works (although I recently took
it apart to replace some old screws and springs and other little parts
to be careful). They literally do not make circular saws like it; it's
all metal, while even the fancy modern stuff is mostly plastic.</p>
<p>The &quot;unfortunate&quot; thing about it and other durable tools is that it's
&quot;bad for the economy,&quot; especially the GDP. Since that thing has been
around since maybe the 50's or 60's, that's as long as 70 years the
economy has gone without the &quot;stimulation&quot; of us having to buy another
saw.</p>
<p>Viewers of my technology videos: Which would be better for the world, if
everyone used the material equivalent of a classic American-made IBM
ThinkPad, or some Apple Laptops that are unfixable computers made of
mostly batteries designed to conk out right before the new version comes
out? Regardless, the Apple Macs that cost thousands a piece are much
better for the &quot;economy.&quot;</p>
<p>That's what I mean. If you have quality tools and do not need to
constantly throw money at the system to buy things, fix things and
otherwise waste money, you are going to be having a lower GDP. That's
just how it is.</p>
<h2 id="the-propagandistic-role-of-gdp">The propagandistic role of GDP</h2>
<p>When you don't think things through like this, GDP is supposed to
appear as an objective measure of economic goodness. You're supposed to
be looking at those GDP charts and saying, &quot;Wow, my life might be
terrible, I am not free, I am subject to forces out of my control, and I
am told I have to participate in mass-consumerism to survive, but these
charts are the facts[!], and the facts say that things are better now,
so I believe them!&quot;</p>
<p>It's legitimately surprising to me how big of a boon the idea of
increasing GDP is for Whig history and NPCs of many different
ideologies. People of the Left and Right will matter-of-factly tell me
that a plastic based economy taking over the world is still good because
the line is going up. I've heard it as a justification for everything:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't like globalization?
<ul>
<li>You're wrong, the GDP is going up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't trust state-funded institutionalized science?
<ul>
<li>You're wrong, the GDP is going up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't want child drag queens?
<ul>
<li>You're wrong, the GDP is going up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't want everything to be made of plastics and other petrochemicals?
<ul>
<li>You're wrong, the GDP is going up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't want mass pornography?
<ul>
<li>You're wrong, the GDP is going up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't want free sugary drinks since infancy?
<ul>
<li>You're wrong, the GDP is going up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you abandon the illusion of GDP, you are suddenly able to ask
whether massive technological &quot;progress&quot; has <em>actually</em> been good for
real human life and human pychology.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2021-01-22 00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/why-its-bad-to-have-high-gdp/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/why-its-bad-to-have-high-gdp/</guid>

<p>I've made a couple very useful command-line accessible Bibles for a
quick and scriptable lookup of Bible verses and passages. They exist not
only in English, but for Latin and Greek as well.</p>
<ol>
<li>English King James Version (including Apocrypha) &mdash;
<a href="https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/kjv">Github</a>,
<a href="https://gitlab.com/lukesmithxyz/kjv">Gitlab</a></li>
<li>Latin Vulgate &mdash; <a href="https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/vul">Github</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/lukesmithxyz/vul">Gitlab</a></li>
<li>Greek Septuagint &amp; New Testament &mdash;
<a href="https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/grb">Github</a>,
<a href="https://gitlab.com/lukesmithxyz/grb">Gitlab</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/kjv.git
cd kjv
sudo make install
</code></pre>
<p>Or just replace <code>kjv</code> with <code>vul</code> for the Latin version or <code>grb</code> for the
Greek.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<h3 id="single-run">Single run</h3>
<p>Run the program name followed by a passage. The text will appear to you
in your pager. Arrows or vim-keys to scroll, <code>q</code> to quit.</p>
<pre><code>kjv rev 3:9
Revelation
3:9     Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are
        Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and
        worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.
</code></pre>
<p>Note that you may also give whole books or chapters. <code>kjv genesis</code> will
give you all of Genesis. <code>kjv mat 1:1-10</code> will show only Matthew 1:1-10.
Note also that you can usually abbreviate books.</p>
<h3 id="searching">Searching</h3>
<p><code>/</code> searches for patterns. For example, <code>kjv /offering</code> will search the
whole Bible for the word &quot;offering.&quot; You may specify a book/location
before it to search only that book.</p>
<h3 id="interactive-mode">Interactive mode</h3>
<p>Just type <code>kjv</code> (or <code>vul</code> or <code>grb</code>) alone to enter interactive mode. You
can then just type verses/books without prefixing them with the command
name each time if you prefer.</p>
<h2 id="origin">Origin</h2>
<p>I forked the original software from <a href="https://github.com/bontibon/kjv">this
repository</a> which is an incomplete
English King James Version (without the Apocrypha). With the use of
coreutils and vim, I found online texts of the Apochrypha, Vulgate,
Septuagint and the <a href="http://sblgnt.com/download/">SBL New Testament</a> and
formatting them to function with this program.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2020-12-11 00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/command-line-bibles/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/command-line-bibles/</guid>

<p>If there is a single point of advice I can offer novice computer users,
it is <em>stop using modern computers</em>.</p>
<p>If you look at &quot;technology YouTube,&quot;  by which I mean the massive multi-million subscriber channels, nearly all of
it is devoted to constantly reviewing and comparing every new computer,
processor, graphics card and product. There's big money in it because
obviously all of these companies put money in it, but also if you're a
normal person, you automatically assume you need the &quot;best&quot;
technology.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-need-a-modern-computer">Do you need a modern computer?</h2>
<p>Absolutely not. More than 95% of people could be using a computer from
2008 or before without any problems. Needing a recent machine is limited
to people who:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do extreme, professional, processor-intensive video-rendering.</li>
<li>Compile massive programs and operating systems with severe time constraints.</li>
<li>Play recent triple AAA video-games on high settings.</li>
<li>Use many massive Electron apps and other inexcusably bad software
written by soydevs and other people who shouldn't be writing
software.</li>
</ol>
<p>The last two reasons aren't really real reasons at all because they are
totally unnecessary and avoidable things.</p>
<p>But to the point, watching YouTube videos and using a word processor
does not require last month's new release.</p>
<p>Every video I upload, I transcode for settings optimal for YouTube,
meaning I render each video I record. On my computer from a decade ago,
that still takes only a couple minutes. A fancy $5000 computer might be
able to do it in less than one, but it is honestly not worth the pain
associated with modern computers.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-should-a-computer-cost-a-normal-person">How much should a computer cost a normal person?</h3>
<p>Either nothing or just around $200, I say. I use a ThinkPad X220 I got
for $90 on eBay. Before that, I used another ThinkPad X220 I also got
for $90. Like anything else, <strong>if you are buying things on Amazon,
you're doing it wrong</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-pain-of-modern-computers">The Pain of Modern Computers</h2>
<h3 id="modern-computers-are-more-breakable">Modern computers are more breakable</h3>
<p>As computing has become more and more popular, companies have started to
realize that a consumer's first reaction on having their $5 wifi card die is
immediately buy a whole new computer. This means two things: (1) they don't
bother to make computers easy to repair, in fact, they make it more difficult
and (2) there is absolutely no need to make computers durable at all. In fact,
it's probably better to let computers break so you'll get yet another sale.</p>
<p>Apple is by far the most anti-social computing company because of this.
I'll let the larger tech channels show you the specifics, but every
Apple product is brilliantly designed to make it difficult to fix very
basic and otherwise fixable problems. They have quite a racket licensing
out the ability and tools to companies that want to fix their terrible
hardware. Apple even used pentalobe screws just so normal people
couldn't open their computers up with a typical screwdriver. Of course
nowadays every other computer manufacturer imitates the Apple style
where apparent &quot;sleekness&quot; is supposed to be a signal of high quality.</p>
<h3 id="modern-computers-are-increasingly-monitoring-devices-and-come-with-proprietary-junk">Modern computers are increasingly monitoring devices and come with proprietary junk.</h3>
<h4 id="the-management-engine">The Management Engine</h4>
<p>You might've heard that all Intel i3/i5/i7 processors (that is, after
the Intel Core 2 Duo) have an onboard alternate processor that is meant
to function as spyware. This is called the Intel Management Engine. It
can view your memory and connect to the internet: basically all modern
computers have this permanent back door. In older computers, say the
ThinkPad X200, you can, with a little hardware action, remove the other
processor and replace the proprietary BIOS with
<a href="https://libreboot.org">Libreboot</a> or <a href="https://coreboot.org">Coreboot</a>,
but that is <em>not possible</em> on more modern computers (you can install
Coreboot on a more modern machine, but not all of the components of the
Management Engine are removed).</p>
<p>More recent computers, however are non-removable spyware by design and,
yes, the NSA can monitor any machine with a Management Engine. There are
actually even rumors that one of the taps that the FBI under the Obama
administration put on Trump during his campaign was a Management Engine
bug.</p>
<p>Note that AMD (Ryzen) processors have what they call a &quot;Platform
Security Processor&quot; that is equivalent to the Intel Management Engine,
so you're not escaping the issue by using one of them.</p>
<h4 id="nvidia">NVIDIA</h4>
<p>Again, unless you play modern videos alone all day, you literally have
no reason to have a modern computer, especially one with an expensive
graphics card. NVIDIA is a great example because they make graphics
cards and develop proprietary drivers for them to make it harder and
harder to use them on machines that aren't running whatever the most
recent spyware variant of Windows 10 is. Linux works perfectly on all
computers ancient and modern, but if you plug some NVIDIA thing up to
it, you might lose your screen or not be able to boot. A lot of gaymers
whine about their NVIDIA products &quot;not working&quot; on Linux without
realizing <strong>that is by design</strong>. NVIDIA and other companies and all CPU
designers go out of their way to keep their source code and standards
private which makes their products tangibly worse because it is harder
for other parties to write drivers for them. Why? Because most of them
have partnerships with Microsoft.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem-of-windows">The Problem of Windows</h3>
<p>How many times have you heard a normie explain to you that their
computer is slow because it's &quot;really old&quot; and they bought it &quot;way
back in 2015?&quot; It's an absurd statement of course. Computers don't
just get magically slow... <strong>...unless they've been running
Windows.</strong></p>
<p>In the future, once even Microsoft has switched over to a purely
Unix-based backend for their operating system, we're all going to have
a good laugh about how Microsoft Windows, <em>literally the worst and least
functioning operating system ever devised</em>, was the largest consumer
market share for decades.</p>
<p>I might go into how Windows is poorly designed in another page or video,
but I want to be clear that there is no such loss of speed on any Linux
distribution, which is what you should be using. I am one of the first
to complain about the feature bloat of the Linux kernel and Linux
software, but compared to Windows, it's no contest: <strong>Linux runs fast
on old hardware</strong>. You'll know from some of my videos, however, that
I'm not <em>big</em> into &quot;Linux Evangelism,&quot; mostly because it's sort of
strident and doesn't really work with a high success rate. Using Linux
is just something that normies have been immunized against (mostly
because &quot;It's what smart people do&quot;), but I always find myself in a
position where someone's Window installation has permanently crashed
and they're at the awkward decision of having to <em>buy a license</em> to
reinstall the dysfunctional and slow operating system they've grown to
hate.</p>
<p>There is quite literally no problem that normal people have with
computers that is not immediately alleviated by installing Linux.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-people-use-thinkpads">Why do people use ThinkPads?</h2>
<p>As I said above, I use a X220 ThinkPad. Older ThinkPads are fairly popular among people who think and care about doing things effectively and economically on a computer. Why is this?</p>
<p>ThinkPads were always designed for enterprise environments, meaning the financial incentives for the manufacturer are not always planned obsolesce, but a long-standing reputation among large companies of having durable, fixable and expandable machines.</p>
<p>To replace a hard drive on the X200 requires unscrewing just a single screw. Same to replace the memory. To replace a spoiled keyboard is no more than three screws.
Modern laptops, including the degraded modern ThinkPad have abandoned this simplicity and opt for the Apple-Mac/cell phone design technique of making batteries, memory and the rest functionally soldered and irremovable.</p>
<h3 id="how-far-can-500-go">How far can $500 go?</h3>
<p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve had many things break on my laptops, but since I&rsquo;ve been using ThinkPads, it is incredibly easy to keep a working computer even after rough use. I estimate that I have never spent more than a combined total of $500 on computers, which is usually a bare minimum for what someone can buy a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; laptop for nowadays.</p>
<p>When the keyboard on my ThinkPad breaks, I can just buy a replacement keyboard for $30 or $40 and replace the old one much easier than any other model. That&rsquo;s the modularity of these computers.</p>
<p>Even in the worst case scenario when something on the motherboard makes the computer unbootable, I still get to keep my &ldquo;broken&rdquo; ThinkPad and repurpose the memory, wifi card, keyboard and everything else. I still have some parts of every laptop I&rsquo;ve had just because they do come in a lot of use. The other month, a friend&rsquo;s wifi on his desktop went out and I could replace it with one of my old ThinkPad modules.</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing you lose with modern computers. This is purposeful on the part of manufacturers, and it&rsquo;s important not to pay them huge amounts of money to incentivize this behavior. It&rsquo;s very easy to live off of 10 year old computers nowadays. The eBay-and-etc resale market is massive even thought many of us have gotten wise to the value of these old computers.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2020-12-11 00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/only-use-old-computers/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/only-use-old-computers/</guid>
<item><title>![CDATA[Science vs. Soyence]]</title><description>![CDATA[<figure class="titleimg"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/soyence.jpg" /></figure>

<p>There's nothing necessarily <em>wrong</em> with science, reason, knowledge
etc. To some degree, they're fundamental for survival in this world in
one way or another. But one of the more worrisome problems which have
arisen since the Enlightenment, and especially in the past several
years, is the fact that whenever scientific knowledge has increased,
human arrogance has accelerated even faster. This isn't a metaphysical,
moral arrogance; it's one that is more and more jeopardizing the human
cosmos.</p>
<p>We live in a pop-scientific and pop-technological world. Because common
people are constantly weighing themselves down with new gadgets and
state-of-the-art genetically engineered food, there's a tendency to
want to pay homage to the amorphous blob of &quot;knowledge.&quot; Of course,
much like the Greek Gods, we cannot seem to speak to &quot;knowledge&quot;
directly, or to mentally murky academics, but only to official
mediators: journalists and &quot;science communicators&quot; and the like.</p>
<p>The religious metaphor is intentional. Of course the actual view of
Popperian science is that scientific &quot;advancement&quot; is less of an
increase in knowledge than a decrease in falsity. We can never be sure
of what is true, but we can gradually establish what is false and
contradictory; science does exclusively the latter. Real scientific work
refutes and calls into question established fact and is in a constant
self-regeneration. Facts mean nothing in themselves.</p>
<p>And scientific models, from our models of the atom, to models of the
Earth's weather and climate, to models of our body are highly
circumstantial, and as a rule, will nearly all inevitably be proven
false. Theories are the narratives we cast over facts which have not yet
been ruled false. We know nearly nothing of how the brain works. Sure,
we know there are synapses, and we know what brains end up doing in some
circumstances, but we haven't begun to scratch the surface of how a
brain is actually engineered (computational models be damned). The same
is true of the human body and is especially true of human society.</p>
<p>Now Neil deGrasse Tyson has the annoying mantra that he repeats at every
possible opportunity, which goes something like: &quot;the good thing about
science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.&quot; First
off, I don't know what's good about that; it'd be pretty damn
convenient to live in a world where we could imagine away gravity or CO2
or cancer, but aside from this, science, actual science as a critical
methodology is manifestly <em>not</em> true and is <em>not</em> the truth. Science is
a way of marginally approaching truth by discovering falsity, and in
most endeavors, this approachment is so marginal as to be inert in all
our daily lives. There is nothing to &quot;believe in&quot; in science anyway,
because it's an exposer of <em>non</em>-truth.</p>
<p>But in pop-science, Science<sup>®</sup> is &quot;knowledge&quot; and deviation from the
scientific catechism is &quot;irrational.&quot; It's not just irrational to
dispute consensus, but irrational to <em>fail to implement it in your
personal life</em>.</p>
<h2 id="in-practice">In Practice</h2>
<p>The greatest danger of pop-science is the unquestioned assumption that
life should be led &quot;scientifically.&quot; That we should &quot;look for
evidence,&quot; &quot;question everything,&quot; and universally &quot;challenge
authority&quot; (unless that authority is a professor). The problem should
be blatantly obvious in hindsight.</p>
<p>An obvious example: in the 20th century, Western societies had to deal
with the very real problem of a bizarre increase in lung cancer rates.
We &quot;know&quot; now that smoking tobacco and other substances apparently
cause drastically higher lung cancer rates, but this was lost on the
people at the time.</p>
<p>The relationship between smoking and cancer was highly circumstantial;
there were some statistical correlations established, but as any
pop-science guru will tell us &quot;correlation is not causation!&quot; For
decades, scientifically minded people looked for evidence while millions
more died. Smoking companies took refuge in the fact that there was no
<em>mechanism</em> understood behind how smoking could cause lung cancer. With
all scientific rigor, they insisted for decades that the increase in
lung cancer was due to something else, or merely an increase in
diagnosis capacity. And <em>they were on the side of scientific
skepticism!</em></p>
<p>Only now that there is some understanding of how carcinogens in smoke
can damage the lungs can we say that the &quot;scientific consensus&quot; is
that smoking causes lung cancer. Cute, but if people had been
<em>&quot;irrationally&quot; cautious</em>, the human tragedy would've been
substantially mitigated.</p>
<p>The problem is that &quot;looking for evidence&quot; before acting or non-acting
is personally and socially dangerous. In nearly all circumstances, our
intuition (crafted by millions of years of evolution) or social norms
(which keep us to established safe routes) are much better guides to
life than the scientific consensus, despite them being &quot;irrational&quot;
(and sorry, religion is part of this too). When someone guzzles down
some newly fabricated energy drink or gallons of soda, they're nearly
certainly damaging their bodies in ways science does not yet understand.
Don't wait 40 years for some longitudinal peer-reviewed study to prove
that eating plastic is bad for you. Trust your instincts before you give
credence to some YouTuber who says inane things like &quot;There's no
evidence that...&quot;</p>
<p>My favorite little &quot;irrationality&quot; that we all commit is of course,
sleep. After millennia of trying to understand it, there is no
established scientific reason or justification for why humans &quot;need&quot;
sleep. Sure there are hypotheses (memory processing, repair, maybe even
something Freudian), but none close to common currency. In the words of
one of the world's most prominent sleep researchers, William Denent,
&quot;As far as I know, the only reason we need to sleep that is really,
really solid is because we get sleepy.&quot; Of course the absence of
logical evidence to the necessity of sleep keeps no NdGT fan from
wasting their time on the &quot;Bronze-Age Myth&quot; of the importance of
sleep.</p>
<h2 id="not-mis-understanding-complex-systems">(Not) (Mis-)Understanding Complex Systems</h2>
<p>The human body is a complex system in which every &quot;system&quot; is
overlapping, somewhat redundant, all-affecting and fundamentally beyond
linear analysis. Our scientific studies can find binary variables that
correlate with a low <em>p</em> value, but that tells us nothings about what's
actually going on and nothing about the underlying mechanisms. Again,
the same is true of the human brain and the same is true of human
<em>society</em>. Nothing is a simple input-output system.</p>
<p>What this means is that basically nothing from the world of pop-science
can <em>ever</em> affect the basics of our lives because the interaction of our
component parts are just non-amenable to any kind of generalizations
that make intuitive sense to us. Everything we do affects our bodies in
ways we can't predict so the proper strategy is always an
&quot;irrational&quot; precaution and avoidance of novelty.</p>
<p>Things, of course, get especially touchy when talking about the
&quot;rational&quot; management of society. Every good denizen of the
post-Enlightenment world, even most of those on the &quot;Right&quot; have the
idea that the economy and social relationships are simple one-to-one
hydraulic systems that can be managed like a little steam engine. Now
we've been rationally managed to hell and not back (and the solution is
always more rational management).</p>
<p>The terrible truth is that traditional social norms are <em>irrational</em> and
<em>still do</em> exist for a reason in the perennial gale of social evolution.
Social change and social progress (note the lack of scare quotes) have
always been happening, but only now do we have the naive idea that the
units of society (people) have the competence to design and contribute
to an otherwise unconscious evolution of social memes.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll give the last word on this issue to Noam Chomsky, who
somehow manages to say something clear and admirable on the subject:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Science is a very strange activity. It only works for simple
problems. Even in the hard sciences, when you move beyond the simplest
structures, it becomes very descriptive. By the time you get to big
molecules, for example, you are mostly describing things. The idea
that deep scientific analysis tells you something about problems of
human beings and our lives and our inter-relations with one another
and so on is mostly pretense in my opinion&mdash;self-serving pretense
which is itself a technique of domination and exploitation and should
be avoided. Professionals certainly have the responsibility of not
making people believe that they have some special knowledge that
others can't attain without special means or special college
education or whatever. If things are simple, they should be said
simply; if there is something serious to say that is not simple, then,
fine, that's good and interesting. We can perhaps find deep answers
to certain questions that do bear directly on issues of human interest
and concern, but that is rarely true.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="science-communicators">&quot;'Science' 'Communicators'&quot;</h2>
<p>One of the worst aspects of all of this is that this understanding of
pop-science encourages people to distrust what they know or can judge of
the world in favor of the caricature of the consensus of
institutionalized academics. People have this idea that there are these
intellectual, peer-reviewed demigods in universities who discover the
secrets to the universe and communicate them through their messengers
stationed at BuzzFeed and the Huffington Post. Betraying their infinite
wisdom would make you &quot;irrational&quot; or a &quot;fundie.&quot; The reality is
that these demigods really just went to graduate school because they
were lazy and initiativeless, and even in the abstract, most of their
real work has nothing to do with your life whatsoever. It's only the
messengers that convince you of that because it stimulates their power
trip.</p>
<p>Science journalists, much like journalists generally, are people too
incompetent and emotional to work in the private sector, too dumb to be
academics (and the standards are abysmally low these days), too full of
themselves to work in charity and too bumbling, weak and arrogant to
work in a blue collar or manual occupation. Journalism is an attractive
career to many because it demands the least rigor and honor and promises
the greatest power and influence.</p>
<p>Their self-ordained duty is to overwhelm the public with a confusion of
&quot;studies&quot; that increasingly seem to micromanage a neurotic person's
life. &quot;Studies show that&quot; classical music may help infant brain
growth, or that gluten ravages the intestines, or that simply owning
more books causes higher scholastic achievement, or that Vitamin C or
antioxidants or kale or whatever health-food <em>de jour</em> solve all the
world's problems.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the worst part is that we talk about &quot;science&quot;
as if it's some kind of anthropomophic creature with desires and
feelings and a plan for us all. It's a uniquely modern flaw to say
things like, &quot;Science tells us that...&quot; &quot;Science is about..&quot;
&quot;Science is against...&quot; Does this not strike anyone else as creepy?
The interpretation of science forced on the public is a scriptural one,
where law to live life by are codified in &quot;peer-reviewed&quot; journals and
communicated by intermediaries. 'Science's' purview is infinite and
any failure to conform is some congenital failure or reason.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2020-12-11 00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/science-vs-soyence/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/science-vs-soyence/</guid>
<item><title>![CDATA[The Fragility of Physics]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Physics has a reputation of being a uniquely &quot;scientific&quot; field. In
other fields, you might hear of the concept of &quot;Physics Envy&quot; which is
supposed to be a deep-seated desire of academics of other disciplines
for the rigorousness and elegance of physics. Only physics, so the
popular understanding goes, is truly able to abstract away from the
messiness of detail and create truly beautiful and solvent models of
their subject matters. Physics is thus the queen of the &quot;hard
sciences.&quot;</p>
<p>I object to the very idea of &quot;hard vs. soft sciences&quot; for reasons that
will soon be clear, but I think it is most important to remember that
for all its pretensions, <strong>physics is the most fragile science</strong>. That
isn't necessarily <em>bad</em>, but it's true.</p>
<h2 id="why-fragile">Why &quot;fragile?&quot;</h2>

<figure class="resright"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/purity_theology.jpg" title="The purity of theology" /></figure>

<p>Put simply, physics, partially due to its somewhat abstract nature, is
exactly that domain where our interpretation of the universe is <em>most
likely</em> to change <em>radically</em> in the event of any kind of theoretical
sea change. That is, while in other more terrestrial sciences, the data
is well-known and the theory is in debate, in physics, the opposite is
arguably true. In astrophysics, quantum mechanics, the study of gravity
or relativity, this should all be obvious.</p>
<p>Even without departing the cuddling embrace of mainstream physics, we
can actually see this clearly. What is the ultimate fate of the universe
to be? A continuous expansion of the universe until heat death? Perhaps
gravity or some other force will pull everything back in a Big Crunch?
The correct alternative is a statement of very specific and tendentious
data which changes quite a great deal with any kind of new
interpretations of what we see.</p>
<p>It's worth it to remember that for most of man's history, including
the initial development of what we nowadays call physics, the &quot;normal
state&quot; of the universe was assumed to be the state of affairs we're
familiar with on the surface of the Earth: everything falls down to the
ground and things propelled in space will slow down until they stop.</p>
<p>But modern physics now looks at the nature of our life on Earth as an
exception to the general rule of frictionless and continuous movement in
the vacuum of space. A valid question to ask is <em>how much more that we
take to be normal is a special case of reality?</em> As we encounter more
and more abberrant data, such as quantum mechanics, we might soon find
ourself unifying seemingly disparate forces in the same was that Newton
in a novel and seemingly absurd way the fact that objects fall to the
ground with the apparent fact that the Earth orbits the Sun into one new
concept: <em>Gravity</em>. Such a unification religates all our universals to a
special case.</p>
<h3 id="does-light-really-go-the-speed-of-light">Does light really go the speed of light?</h3>
<p>Physics is fragile because it is like a game of Jenga. Pull out or
change one piece and the whole thing is either reordered or simply
collapses.</p>
<p>As an example, say that within several years, we realize that the speed
of light, for some known or unknown reason, doesn't function with the
universality we assumed. Suppose that there is some kind of interaction
of light and gravity such that light is faster in some parts of the
universe. The reason isn't important. Or suppose we merely find out
that in the past, there has been a systematic principle (similar to the
Heisenberg Principle) that has miscalibrated all of our measurements of
light.</p>
<p>Even if we have minutely mismeasured, the Jenga piece of light will
radically alter everthing: our ideas of how old the universe is, our
relationships with other planets, the solvency of general relativity,
etc. You might say that there is a &quot;concordance of evidence&quot; that
attests to our single known speed of light, but another way of putting
that is that we have many other things tied into our interpretation of
light that will have to change if we realize our models of it are
flawed.</p>
<h3 id="poverty-of-data">Poverty of data</h3>
<p>Especially in the astronomical domain, it's worth remembering exactly
how circumstantial our ideas of space are. We sometime speak of the
traits of other solar systems' planets as if we've been there. But in
reality, astrophysicists guess the chemical compositions of foreign
planets based on their light frequencies and other fragile data. Any
systematic error in observation over those thousands or millions of
lightyears and we have been counting angels on pinheads the whole time.</p>
<p>People have the idea that because astrophysicists make extraordinary
claims about planets, galaxies and time periods far beyond our mortal
ken that they must have extraordinary evidence for them. That is frankly
not the case. We have a piece-meal and jury-rigged set of circumstantial
reasoning leading us to these claims. Seeing them computerized in full
color in a science documentary doesn't make them more real. It just
makes them look more official.</p>
<h2 id="physics-vs-soft-sciences">Physics vs. &quot;soft sciences&quot;</h2>
<p>I remember talking to someone over the internet who accused me of having
a low view of institutionalized science and being a dreaded
epistemological anarchist because one of my degrees is in the &quot;soft
science&quot; of linguistics. While I have a lot of bad things to say about
the current state of linguistics, as a field, it is substantially more
advanced and its findings are substantially more solid than physics. At
that, formalizing ideas in math doesn't just make something a better or
a more rigorous science anyway, which is the assumption of many people
have.</p>
<p>While linguistics undergoes theoretical changes every several
generations, the <em>data</em>, or really more importantly <em>the phenomenology</em>
of linguistics is as secure as ever across all theoretical frameworks.
That is, we know how language works. We can see abstract relationships
between morphemes and syntactic structure. Even if we totally rewrite
our narratives and theories about linguistic basics, there is no debate
about the structure of language and how basic data relates to other
data. This is absolutely the opposite of physics.</p>
<p>Physics is pretty solid on earth, and solid when you are running objects
at each other in a vacuum, but once we broach the territory of
astrophysics, relativity, gravity and more or less <em>anything else that
we as humans lack direct intuition of</em> most of the &quot;facts&quot; of physics
are theory-internal facts, and will fade away or be rendered obsolete
when the next theoretical fad comes around.</p>
<h2 id="my-standard-for-theoretical-frameworks">My standard for theoretical frameworks</h2>
<p>I think any serious scholar needs the ability to operate cognitively
with multiple different theoretical frameworks in mind.</p>
<p>For example, (on linguistics) I don't really take Generative Grammar
very seriously, in fact, despite it being on of the most well-funded
dialects of linguistics nowadays, it's pretty inert. Despite that, I
view it as very important for me to be able to process linguistic
problems within Generative Grammar and word explanations within its
ideas. It's nice to be able to say to someone &quot;this alternation is
accounted for if this DP occupies the spec of CP.&quot; I don't <em>believe</em>
in CPs or specifiers as being psychologically real, but I can recognize
the language as communicative.</p>
<p><strong>A good theoretical framework is one that can produce facts and
observations that can be recognized and explained outside of its
framework as well.</strong></p>
<p>That is, a framework should cue us in to finding utterly novel
observations and thus a new <em>phenomenology</em>. This goes against the
egocentric motivations of a lot of scientific frameworks whose
practitioners are trying to edge out &quot;the competition.&quot; Fields that
spend most of their time trying to formalize previous observations
within their own theoretical language are mostly a waste of time (this
is Generative Grammar, frankly, although due to historical ignorance,
many people in GG do not know they are re-treading steps).</p>
<p>One of the biggest issues of modern post-war institutionalized science
is that the funding and peer-review mechanism is self-reinforcing: all
fields converge to be &quot;unipolar&quot;: only one methodology or framework is
deemed &quot;scientific.&quot; This creates a community of &quot;scientists&quot; who
are more an more incestuous and generally oblivious not just to other
possibilities of inquiry, but don't even have to be aware of their own
priors or assumptions.</p>
<h2 id="the-blinders-of-positivism">The blinders of positivism</h2>
<p>As I've interacted with physicists more, I'm often <em>surprised</em> by how
irrelevant they think even the most basic theoretical awareness is.
That's &quot;philosophy&quot; for them. It's not uncommon to hear zingers like
these:</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;Science isn't about truth, it's about creating models.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Physics is about fitting equations.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;We don't do philosophy.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>Things like these are said as if they are some kind of statement of
universal and well-consented-to truth, when in reality they are absurd
Zen koans of the positivist religion. This was a loony opinion a hundred
years ago and people saying these things now <em>know</em> that they are
ludicrous. They have just become identifying marks of the social club.</p>
<p>Yep, science is about creating models... models that replicate reality,
i.e. <em>Truth</em>.</p>
<p>A scientists who doesn't do philosophy isn't a scientist: he's a
meter-reader. A philosopher who doesn't do science isn't a
philosopher: he's just a stoner. The attempt to sever these two words
from each other is part of the problem.</p>
<p>Physicists seem to be particularly touchy on this point. On one hand,
they insist that philosophy is &quot;not their thing&quot; and &quot;not related.&quot;
On the other hand, they get incredibly angry when <em>anyone else</em> dares to
either put the methodology of modern physics to any kind of
philosophical tests <em>or even</em> to look into philosophical ramifications
of their work.</p>
<p>In reality, modern scientists and positivists have their own
metaphysics, it is just an <em>implicit</em> one that they advertently or
inadvertently sneak into their theories. They can only do it because its
clumsy sterile &quot;materialism&quot; is the background-radiation of the modern
world.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2020-12-11 00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/the-fragility-of-physics/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/the-fragility-of-physics/</guid>
<item><title>![CDATA[Why I Use the GPL and Not Cuck Licenses]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Every piece of software I write I license under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html">GNU Public License
Version 3</a> (GPLv3)
unless I have forked it from something else.</p>
<p>The GPLv3 is the premiere <em>copyleft</em> license, meaning that it not
only allows users to run, modify and distribute their own versions of
what I write, but it also requires that no one in that chain of
development restrict and close-source that software: it and software
deriving from it must forever remain open, usable and sharable. Richard
Stallman, one of the minds behind the GPL has described it as a &quot;hack&quot;
of the copyright system because it uses the legal infrastructure of
copyright to ensure software is free rather than restricted.</p>
<p>But occasionally I get asked why I don't use so-called <em>permissive licenses</em> like BSD or MIT. These are free software licenses, but
they <em>do not</em> require that forked versions of the code be free and open
source software. In other words, you can take something written with a
BSD or MIT license, put it in the next version of Windows and no one
will ever know. If you did that with GPL code, you'd be in for big
legal trouble if found out.</p>
<p>I and others have recently taken to calling these permissive licenses
<em>Cuck Licenses</em>.</p>
<h2 id="why-cuck-licenses">Why &quot;Cuck Licenses?&quot;</h2>
<p>Why be mean and bully BSD and MIT licenses calling them &quot;Cuck
Licenses?&quot;</p>
<p>Quite simply, using them is precisely analogous to being cuckolded. When
you really look at it, the similarity is uncanny.</p>
<p>I understand GPL free software and its ethical vision for software. I
also understand that desire for people and businesses to <em>not</em> release
their source code for commercial and monetary benefits. What I don't
understand is simultaneously releasing free code with no requirement
that it remain free. It can now be used against you and others&mdash;if you
had moral qualms about that, you could've <em>at least</em> made money off of
it yourself.</p>
<p>Using a Cuck License <em>especially</em> for &quot;ethical reasons&quot; or &quot;because I
like open source software&quot; is beyond absurd. You're simply writing
code and effectively abandoning the privileges of intellectual property
while allowing any large corporation to come and close-source and
monetize your software and sell it back to you without any other
obligations. You have also abandoned your ability to ever complain about
IBM, Microsoft, Apple or any other tech giant because <strong>you are
literally writing their proprietary software</strong>. These companies even
sometimes take very simple code from minor projects and use it to save a
buck and a little effort.</p>

<figure class="resright"><a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/timnolet.png"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/timnolet.png" title="'Noooo! You can't use my heckin' code that I legally gave you the right to use!'" /></a><figcaption>When you license with a permissive license, you don't have a say anymore.</figcaption></figure>

<p>At the end of the day, using a Cuck License is little different from
either releasing software in the public domain or just not licensing it
(in some jurisdictions, at least). It has the pretense of a license, but
for no real function. I suppose depending on which you use, you at least
get your name on the license, but I hardly think that that's how
internet fame and glory is actually distributed anyway. As far as I'm
concerned <strong>using a Cuck License is worse for user freedom than just
releasing it in the public domain</strong>. This is because at least public
domain software can be taken and later additions can be protected by the
GPL. The legal case for doing that with a Cuck License is not so clear.</p>
<h3 id="no-whiners">No whiners!</h3>
<p>The funniest thing is when Cuck Licensers <em>complain</em> that people are
abiding by their licenses. They will <em>complain</em> that people took their
code and made money off of it. They will <em>complain</em> when they don't get
some social credit they feel like they deserve when their code is used
in a project. They will <em>complain</em> if people fork their project and it
becomes more popular than the original. They will <em>complain</em> when some
tech giant takes their code and makes spyware out of it.</p>
<p>If they were serious about stopping any of this, <em>they easily could've
by licensing their project as anything other than a code giveaway</em>. If
you want praise for some contribution, put it in the license. If you
don't want your software used for proprietary software, use the GPLv3.</p>
<h2 id="a-cuck-licenser-gets-what-he-deserves-and-we-all-pay-the-price">A Cuck Licenser gets what he deserves (and we all pay the price).</h2>
<p>One of the funniest and saddest horror stories of Cuck Licenses I can
think of is Andrew Tanenbaum, who released MINIX, an operating system,
under a BSD license. Intel silently took this software (thanks to its
license) and unbeknownst to him, used it for their Intel Management
Engine, <strong>making it the OS of the spyware microprocessor/backdoor now
running in all Intel CPUs</strong>. We all have a permanent NSA backdoor
because of the Intel Management Engine&mdash;all made possibly by Cuck
License cuckery.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/intel/">Only many, many years later was this even revealed to
Tanenbaum.</a> Read that blog post of his
as he slowly externalizes his mixed feelings, tinged with guilt. After
all, on the &quot;bright&quot; side, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I guess that makes MINIX the most widely used computer operating
system in the world, even more than Windows, Linux, or MacOS.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, what a proud achievement. But regardless, Tanenbaum already feels
some regret about the fact that his permissive license allowed Intel to
withhold this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This was a complete surprise. I don't mind, of course, and was not
expecting any kind of payment since that is not required. There isn't
even any suggestion in the license that it would be appreciated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The
only thing that would have been nice is that after the project had
been finished and the chip deployed, that someone from Intel would
have told me, just as a courtesy, that MINIX was now probably the most
widely used operating system in the world on x86 computers. That
certainly wasn't required in any way, but I think it would have been
polite to give me a heads up, that's all.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="resright"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/cia.png" title="A glow-in-the-dark CIA gamer" /></figure>

<p>You can feel the regret. <strong>With Cuck Licenses, you get the worst of two
worlds:</strong> You get no credit for your work, nor money for licensing fees
like other proprietary software and your software will be used to
violate your and other users' privacy when it is used in closed-source
environments. Oh, no... copes incoming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Many people (including me) <strong>don't like the idea of an all-powerful
management engine in there at all</strong> (since it is a possible security
hole and a dangerous idea in the first place), but that is Intel's
business decision and a separate issue from the code it runs. A
company as big as Intel could obviously write its own OS if it had
to.&quot; <em>emphasis added</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Tanenbaum had released MINIX under the GPL, we <em>wouldn't be</em> at the
mercy of Intel's business decision. They would've had to release the
source code for the microprocessor, keeping user privacy ensured and
irradicating the permanent spyware liability all computers have
nowadays.</p>
<p>If they wouldn't want to do that, they'd have to just write an
operating system themselves. Tanenbaum is right, they obviously
<em>could've</em> taken the time and money to write an OS themselves if they
had to, but they <em>didn't have to</em>, <strong>because a BSD license cuck wrote
it for them</strong>. Thanks a lot, sucker! Now our computers are being
monitored at a lower start-up cost and we have you to thank. It
would've been a lot <em>more</em> respectable to <em>not</em> use a permissive
license and instead license it proprietarily if he has no moral issues
with proprietary software: he could've <em>at least</em> gotten Intel to pay
him to use his operating system. Heck, if he had used the GPL and if
they took it anyway, he could become an insta-millionaire by suing them
right now.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is perhaps lost on Tanenbaum, who finishes up his
blog post with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If nothing else, this bit of news reaffirms my view that the
Berkeley license provides the maximum amount of freedom to potential
users.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Maximum amount of freedom to potential users&quot; is somehow
mass-surveilance of every computer user thanks to the BSD license.
Thanks for your contribution to &quot;freedom.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="the-freedom-that-cuck-licenses-preserve">The Freedom that Cuck Licenses &quot;preserve&quot;</h2>
<p>&quot;Freedom&quot; is an incoherent buzzword if you don't define it. There are
some people who might argue that the fact that they can't kill and
steal freely is a violation of their &quot;freedom.&quot; That's very true in
some sense.</p>
<p>In the same way, the GPL (unlike Cuck Licenses) &quot;violates&quot; the freedom
of all people to close-source code and hide it from the public and (in
effect) do annoying or privacy-violating things with it.</p>
<p>The goal of the Free Software Movement, defended by copyleft licenses
like the GPL is for all software writers and users to live in an
environment of publicly auditable, editable and exchangable code. The
goals of the Open Source movement have a similar goal, albeit often
guided by practical considerations.</p>

<figure class="resright"><img alt="Cuck-licensers write proprietary software for free." src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/janny.jpg" /><figcaption>He does it for free.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Cuck Licenses, however, undermine those goals. They will <em>say</em> that they
maximize freedom by placing no requirement on those who distribute When
you release any code under a Cuck License, you are simply writing free
commercial code for corporations that will inevitably use it against
you. You might as well just <em>actually get a job with them</em> so you can
get paid for what you do instead of just getting cucked. When you
release code under the GPL, you write free software that benefits other
people who write free software.</p>
<p>The Free Software Foundation and the GPL people have correctly realized
that just being &quot;permissive&quot; with licenses is unworkable in the
current environment. The legal infrastructure incentivizes and defends
proprietary software and gives it a systematic financial advantage. The
GPL is a viral antidote to that. Obviously if all software were free and
no laws protected &quot;intellectual property&quot; in publicly obtainable
software, <em>everything</em> would be &quot;permissively licensed.&quot; We don't
live in that world. The GPL and other &quot;copyleft&quot; licenses are ways of
undermining and disincentivizing and making impossible the
close-sourcing of software. Not using the GPL and using a cuck license
is just the same as writing proprietary because <em>you literally are</em>
because all of your software can be snatched up and proprietarily
licensed.</p>
<h2 id="bbuut-the-gpl-isnt-enforceable">&ldquo;B...buut the GPL isn't enforceable!&rdquo;</h2>
<p>I've heard some people pass around the idea that somehow the GPL is
unenforceable. After all, if you have close source software, how can
anyone really tell what's going on? In some cases, that might be true
if you have perfect op-sec. That wouldn't be the case for the Intel
Management Engine above, and that wouldn't be the case for Windows XP,
whose source code recently leaked.</p>
<p>I have known people in industry writing proprietary software and
worrying about the GPL is real. The &quot;virus&quot; of GPL taking over
everything and making it free is something people have to take heed of.
I'm sure there is some level of GPL-violation going on in some places
at least, just because lifting simple routines or copy-and-pasting some
things from GPL with significant enough changes could go unseen even if
leaked, but integrating larger GPL programs would be nearly an
impossibility.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, though, what does it matter? What is a totally
unenforced GPL? It's just a Cuck License&mdash;Isn't that what license
cucks want? So why should they care? At their very best, BSD and MIT
licenses are only what GPL might be at its very worst.</p>
<p>The GPL is a permanent liability for any company that crosses it. Some
companies might be so bold to lift GPL code and hide it, but there is
always a risk and a worry that prevents its general violation.</p>
<h2 id="addendum">Addendum</h2>
<h3 id="are-copyleft-licenses-always-best-even-for-freedom">Are copyleft licenses always best even for freedom?</h3>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Here's a question I got about this article that I'll reproduce here
because it touches on something good.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[personal details omitted for anonymity]

However, I read your article, and I can see your point. I have an idea for an
Operating System and due to your arguments, I would definitely license that
under the GPL, as well as any new programs I write. I might even change most or
all of my current programs to GPL, with the exception of that bc, which needs
to remain BSD since it is default in FreeBSD now.

That said, I have a library I am working on, and my experience is that
libraries under the GPL do not get used, unless a commercial license is offered
as well, and often, not even then. You can see this with glibc, which has a
special linking exception and the fact that the LGPL is fairly popular for
libraries.

First question: what is your opinion on the linking exception and the LGPL? Are
they Cuck Licenses? I mean, they do require that the library and any
modifications be put under the LGPL, which means that the library remains libre
software. However, they can also be put into proprietary code, which is the
entire reason you call MIT and BSD licenses Cuck Licenses.

Basically, it seems as though you are correct when it comes to licensing
programs themselves. But it gets murkier when talking about libraries.

[other personal details omitted]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This was my response to this email explaining this finer point.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Yeah. There are sometimes times when it is tactically better to license
things under a permissive license if for institutional reasons:
mass-adoption is required and companies and such might be unnerved by
the GPL. Libraries might often be like that. So it's not necessarily a
purity-spiralling point.

RMS actually advised that ogg/vorbis should use a cuck license to
maximize adoption (it originally used the LGPL, but switched to BSD):

https://lwn.net/2001/0301/a/rms-ov-license.php3

It's thanks to this that it has now become a usable and wide-spread
format, used now on nearly every proprietary web service because of its
small-size, good fidelity and general superiority.

So yeah, if you're writing a standalone program, I'd use the GPL, but I
would choose licenses ultimately in terms of which would maximize the
possibilities for users of using free-software. In some circumstances,
that means using a cuck license. Same is true of the LGPL. I think
GNU/FSF recommend LGPL only to be used when it is competing with a
proprietary library, and if that's usually what you are writing, you
might end up writing a lot in the LGPL.

<item><title>![CDATA[Hedonism, Asceticism and the Hermetic Answer]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>The modern world more or less gives you the philosophical choice of
either <em>Hedonism</em> or <em>Asceticism</em>. You never really hear it
in those terms, but that's how it is.</p>
<p><strong>Hedonism living for pleasure.</strong> Your default lifestyle is eating
whatever, watching Netflix and playing video games irrespective of how
late it is. You watch porn, masturbate, have sex as much as you can and
any consequences of any of this are just facts of life which you view as
either out of your control or worth the suffering. You might not use
drugs because you are worried of the hedonistic damage it can cause, but
you're at least &ldquo;chill&rdquo; with people who do. At a basic level, modern
society is hedonistic because it more or less openly holds as highest
moral value what can stimulate people the most. You know this is the
case because anyone who <em>condemns</em> hedonistic behavior will immediately
be judged as &ldquo;judgemental.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Asceticism is supposed to be the &ldquo;smart&rdquo; alternative.</strong> Asceticism is
rejecting pleasure, normal life and anything else enjoyable in the world
as morally inferior to some higher non-physical ideal. Buddhism, which
rejects the physical world, has become a popular meme philosophy in the
West and is highly acetic. Vegans are acetic: they abandon basic life
for their own principles and intense vegans will eventually start
talking about &quot;transcending&quot; and &quot;vibrations&quot; and non-sense. Look at
the anti-global warming movements and they fall perfectly, almost
neurotically into this category. Asceticism come in many forms nowadays,
but it is always a reaction to the indulgences of hedonism.</p>
<h2 id="the-poetic-worldview">The Poetic Worldview</h2>
<p><a href="https://renaissanceastrology.com/hermestrismegistus.html"></a></p>

<figure class="resright"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/hermes.png" /><figcaption>Hermes Trismegistus, author of the Hermetic Corpus</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Poetic Worldview is the solution. Don't worry, it has nothing to do
with poetry.</p>
<p>The Greek word that <em>poetry/poetic</em> comes from actually is just a
generic word for <em>make, create, produce</em>. The word &quot;poetry&quot; originally
just meant something like &quot;creative output.&quot;</p>
<p>This view is tied into early Platonism and monotheism. The physical
universe is a creation or manifestation or &quot;the One&quot; or &quot;the Source&quot;
or really [God]{.dfn}. God is the ultimate creator, and an individual is
<strong>good</strong> insofar as [he reflects this creative tendency of God]{.dfn}.
We see it expounded in the Hermetic Corpus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The other name of God is Father, again because He is the
that-which-maketh-all. The part of father is to make.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.gnosis.org/library/grs-mead/TGH-v2/th205.html">To
Asclepius</a>
(17), from the <a href="http://www.gnosis.org/library/hermet.htm">Hermetic
Corpus</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Poetic Worldview, <strong>the highest moral goal is creation</strong>. That
can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>affecting the world,</li>
<li>improving what is around you,</li>
<li>having children,</li>
<li>making money not to spend it on pleasures, but to make something new
and great with it,</li>
<li>writing or making something useful or edifying for others,</li>
<li>clearing up misconceptions that get in other people's way in
accomplishing these things.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the Poetic worldview, hedonism is evil because it is expending
otherwise creative energy into nothing of consequence. Racking up
video-game achievements that no one will ever know or care of but you,
watching pornography, pursuing fleeting relationships, impulsively
wasting time browsing the internet and fiddling with social media.</p>
<p>This passive and impulsive pleasure-seeking reduces someone's ability
to live as intended, instead, they are prisoners to their lusts and
conveniences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But whatsoever human souls have not the Mind as pilot, they share in
the same fate as souls of lives irrational. For [Mind] becomes
co-worker with them, giving full play to the desires towards which
[such souls] are borne,&mdash;[desires] that from the rush of lust
strain after the irrational; [so that such human souls,] just like
irrational animals, cease not irrationally to rage and lust, nor ever
are they satiate of ills. For passions and irrational desires are ills
exceeding great; and over these God hath set up the Mind to play the
part of judge and executioner.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.gnosis.org/library/grs-mead/TGH-v2/th225.html">About the Common
Mind</a> (4),
from the <a href="http://www.gnosis.org/library/hermet.htm">Hermetic Corpus</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hedonism is additionally harmful because <em>it isn't even hedonistic</em>.
It's clumsy and self-destructive. Spend your life from ages 16-23
playing videogames, masturbating and smoking weed and you have destroyed
your capacity to enjoy life, sex and have normal interactions with
normal people. Your capacity for enjoyment ends and you fall into
asceticism as a cope.</p>
<p><strong>Asceticism is just as evil</strong> because it sees this issue with the
hedonistic lifestyle and tosses up its hands in surrender. It
internalizes the lie that wasteful and sinful living is somehow
obviously funner&mdash;when they see they aren't actually having fun, they
throw the whole world away.</p>
<p><strong>Most ascetics are liars anyway.</strong> They pretend to reject pleasure and
worldly things, but they often just seek it in perverted or
unconventional ways. There are men who call themselves MGTOW (Men going
their own way) who &quot;swear off&quot; women. In reality, most of them are
just desperate porn-addicted men who just can't get the girl they want.</p>
<p>Contrary to all of this, having a Poetic view proposes that the more
moral and also most enjoyable life is one where one is constantly
creating something new out of what he is given. In Hermetic thinking
(and, well, Christian thinking) man must hold God as the idea to
emulate. Since God's principle feat is creation from nothing, our goal
is to celebrate that creation by making something new and productive
from the raw materials we have.</p>
<p>Asceticism views the material world <em>as a mistake or illusion</em> which
leads people to reject life itself. The Poetic view is that the physical
world is a <strong>reflection of its spiritual state</strong>, and what you do in the
physical world reflects your spiritual stature.</p>
<p>The Poetic view is <em>somewhat</em> similar to Nietzsche's <em>Will to Power</em>,
which was an attempt to unite both human and material
sciences under the idea that the ideal is maximizing one's output on
the external world. Will to Power is a little more morally ambivalent
though; it can include destruction, while Poeticism merely values
creative power.</p>
<h2 id="distractions-are-literally-evil">Distractions are literally evil.</h2>
<p>This is why <em>I highly condemn wasteful activities like videogames and pornography and social media.</em> They are principally habits that
divert your natural energies into something absolutely sterile. <strong>Many
people ask me &ldquo;What can I do to be more productive?&rdquo;</strong> and I have to say
that the most important thing is to <strong>remove inert distractions and
habits</strong>.</p>
<p>Due to bureaucratic workplaces and bureaucratic education, there are
many modern people who <em>just don't know what it means to be
productive</em>. Most of their lives might be someone trying to fill their
day with busywork. Since the normal enjoyable ritual of creative output
is unknown to them, this causes a kind of aimlessness and the <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/files/unabomber.pdf">feelings
of inferiority</a> that comes with that.</p>
<p>But in truth, you live at <strong>an ideal period</strong> in that you can have a
highly impactful and ergo <em>poetic</em> effect on the world using internet
technology and the higher material standard of living. The only trick is
to sidestep the distractions of hedonism that turns you into a passive
consumer and the apathy of asceticism.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2020-09-03 00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/hedonism-asceticism-and-the-hermetic-answer/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/hedonism-asceticism-and-the-hermetic-answer/</guid>

The plan of Christ is to reunite man with God's order, in the same way that Stoics attempted to submit to divine <em>Logos</em>.</p><h1>More...</h1><ul><li>The <em>Not Related!</em> website: <a href="https://notrelated.xyz"></a>notrelated.xyz</a></li><li>Donations will be read in the middle of each episode: <a href="https://donate.notrelated.xyz">donate.notrelated.xyz</a></li></ul>]]</description><pubDate>2020-07-31 04:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://notrelated.xyz/audio/s02/S02E02_-_Stoicism_and_Christianity_Trust_the_Logos.ogg</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://notrelated.xyz/audio/s02/S02E02_-_Stoicism_and_Christianity_Trust_the_Logos.ogg</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Against Method and For 'Pseudoscience']]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Paul Feyerabend argued for 'Epistemological Anarchism': that in order to do truly good science, one can't rule out alternative methods, <em>ad hoc</em> hypotheses, mythology, religion and wishful thinking. Using the example of Galileo, he shows how science's greatest strides are made by deliberately being "unscientific" in the way that court scientists tend to think nowadays.</p><p>Epistemological Anarchism is a total rejection of the so-called "demarcation problem": the attempt by early 20th century philosophers to distinguish "science" from other realms. It overturns the assumptions of logical positivism and returns us to the conception of knowledge held by antiquity, the scholastics, the Renaissance and everyone else: science can't rule out its perceived opponents by technicality or it would have also undermined the very "pseudoscientists" that developed us our scientific conceptions of today.</p><details>📚 See readings and other media.<p><em>Note that pay-walled academic articles may be obtained by feeding their URLs to sites like Sci-Hub.</em></p><ul><li><em>Against Method</em> (Paul Feyerabend)</li><li><em>Conjectures and Refutations</em> (Karl Popper)</li><li><em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em> (Thomas Kuhn)</li><li><a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hooft101/fringe-oct-2017.pdf">"The importance of recognising fringe science"</a> (Gerald t'Hooft)</li></ul></details><h1>More...</h1><ul><li>The <em>Not Related!</em> website: <a href="https://notrelated.xyz"></a>notrelated.xyz</a></li><li>Donations will be read in the middle of each episode: <a href="https://donate.notrelated.xyz">donate.notrelated.xyz</a></li></ul>]]</description><pubDate>2020-06-05 04:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://notrelated.xyz/audio/s02/S02E01_-_Against_Method_and_For_Pseudoscience.ogg</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://notrelated.xyz/audio/s02/S02E01_-_Against_Method_and_For_Pseudoscience.ogg</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Politics matters most to slaves.]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Now onto the second point I didn't get to <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/why-do-i-so-rarely-talk-about-politics-on-my-channel">in my post
yesterday</a>:
politics only matters so much when you're a slave. Or as I put it
there, &quot;You will need politics less than you think.&quot;</p>
<p>That is to say that if you live in a city where your every action is
watched, if you use proprietary software and communicate only via social
media services, if you have no marketable skills because you have some
inert degree and questionably productive and definitely replaceable job
and a large company, you need politics quite a great deal.</p>
<p>Your entire existence in the system is based on being a good boy within
the established boundaries of what is deemed by the mass media to be
socio-politically appropriate. <em>Maybe</em> you've gone into debt, but you
<em>definitely</em> rely the whole &quot;system&quot; for all the basics. If you don't
think you do, just ask yourself whether your life has changed for the
better after the Coronachan Panic of 2020.</p>
<p>What's the alternative? Well, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRVmfx4EWI0">boomer rants viewers might see some of
this coming</a>...</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that both the daily ins-and-outs of politics
and the overarching trends of politics matter very little the more
independent your are of the system. Earlier, I always mumbled about how
conservaboomers seemed a little too apathetic about the cultural changes
being forced on them. This social engineering still is the most serious
problem in all technologically-complex mass-media societies, but I must
admit for people who choose personal independence and independence for
their families and local communities, it is much less of a problem.</p>
<p>When I was plugged into the system, minorly red-pilled and generally
peeved because I actually paid attention to the media as something other
than to laugh at, I found the idea of Political &quot;Exit&quot; pretty cucky.
How much sense does it make to leave the &quot;political process&quot;
altogether? Sounds like giving up.</p>
<p>It sounds like giving up because the &quot;political process&quot; is something
internal to the media system at large. That's why even when the
political process does something the media doesn't like (like electing
the Orange Boomer, for example), its actions are immediately rendered
inert by fakery.</p>
<p>The actual solution is creating and participating in organic society,
which still very much exists outside the purview of the media and NGOs
and the like. People still need plumbers. No one is going to fire a
plumber because he says trannies are mentally ill men in
dresses&mdash;otherwise there'd be no plumbers. Or electricians, or
builders or anyone who actually does anything productive. It'd just be
HR, journalists and professors left... and some open source developers
who write more codes of conducts than they do software. Do you think
they'll be able to feed you?</p>
<p>Exiting the system is actually the opposite of surrender. Why would you
think the solution is something like voting or even &quot;owning the libs&quot;
or something publicly advertised as a solution? The actual solution is
building an alternative. Or maybe <em>rebuilding</em> the alternative.</p>
<p>Do you really want to make your boss rich if you think he'd turn around
and betray you because of a media witchhunt? It's better for you to be
doxxed and fired now rather than wait 20 years for it, getting more
ensconced in the insanity. Start becoming more independent now.</p>
<p>A lot of people LARP about what they're going to do when they take over
&quot;the system&quot; by revolution. Revolution, the idea of abrupt enforced
change, however, is fundamentally their idea and if you buy it, you're
going to keep running your head into a wall.</p>
<p>Being independent, living out of the city and the Matrix, however, is
simultaneously like transporting yourself back in time to when things
were saner, but at the same time, transporting yourself into the future
where &quot;the system&quot; has already collapsed and we're already
rebuilding. Be a part of it now rather than later.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2020-05-09 00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/politics-matters-most-to-slaves/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/politics-matters-most-to-slaves/</guid>

In this episode we review a large lump of scientific papers, few having made it into popular culture or general knowledge so far, but all painting a picture of human prehistory that is much deeper and longer than the old theorists behind recent Out-of-Africa migration theories.</p><p>We talk about human settlements in unexpected places and unexpected times, hidden genetic lineages and Neanderthal seafaring, language and construction. Too often do the "Well, <em>actually!</em>" crowd focus on listening to partial evidence instead of using their head, and we see how this has harmed the theories in the field of paleo-history. Soon, we'll move the microscope closer to home and talk about what early humans might've been up to all that time...</p><details>📚 See readings and other media.<p><em>Note that pay-walled academic articles may be obtained by feeding their URLs to sites like Sci-Hub.</em></p><ul><li>Smith et al. 2018. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25967">Humans trived in South Africa through the Toba eruption about 74,000 years ago</a>.

<item><title>![CDATA[When You're Too Rational to Be Rational!]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Are humans rational? What would that even mean? Does it mean we follow the laws of formal logic, or does it mean we only care about getting a positive end result? Some modern psychologists, often in the vein of <em>the Heuristics and Biases Program</em> (&agrave; la Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky) often implicitly assume that these are the same thing, that humans are often gravely miscalibrated in our sense of reason. We are logically broken. Some, proponents of <em>Libertarian Paternalism</em>, propose that this illogicalness should be actively mitigated by governmental policy and <em>Nudging</em> (see Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler's book <em>Nudge</em>).</p><p>But another line of thought, <em>Ecological Rationality</em> holds that what seems "irrational" about human behavior is only an artifact of when we fail to look at our decision-making in improper circumstances in the laboratory. What aspects of our psychology <em>seem</em> irrational are often mechanisms based in the wisdom of real-life risk, and far more trust-worthy than the recommendations of psychologists and behavioral economists. Sometimes even, our irrational mind is much smarter than we are.</p><details>📚 See readings and other media.<p><em>Note that pay-walled academic articles may be obtained by feeding their URLs to sites like Sci-Hub.</em></p><ul><li><em>Rationality for Mortals</em> (Gerd Gigerenzer)</li><li><em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> (Daniel Kahneman)</li><li><em>Nudge</em> (Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein)</li><li><em>What Darwin Got Wrong</em> (Jerry Fodor and Massimo Piatelli-Palmarini)</li><li><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3132220">"Libertarian Paternalism"</a> (Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein)</li><li><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00497.x">Environments That Make Us Smart: Ecological Rationality</a> (Peter Todd and Gerd Gigerenzer)</li></ul></details><h1>Timecodes</h1><pre>00:00	Rationality for Big-Braned Mortals

In our cocoon of electronic toys and United Nations statistics about how great the world is, it might sound absurd to say that by many of the most crucial metrics, human life has become measurably worse since man adopted agriculture. Our bodies, our metabolism, our social structure, our psychology and our deepest desires are built for paleolithic life, but now that that life has been nearly entirely abandoned, we find ourselves thoroughly unfit for the marvelous technology that defines our new environment, and environment which is changing far faster than we can keep up.</p><p>Even worse, the comfort of modernity is putting us in potentially disastrous evolutionary circumstances. We are accumulating harmful mutations, while at the same time, becoming more mentally cloistered.

<item><title>![CDATA[The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Inspired by the vastly different mindset and cultural and religious structure of ancient civilizations, the psychologist Julian Jaynes put for the radical notion of the <em>Bicameral Mind</em>, which posits that ancient people, indeed <em>all</em> people in their more natural environment are not actually conscious.</p><p>Consciousness, to Jaynes, was a mental habit that gradually developed in the period after the Bronze Age collapse, around 1200 BC. Before that, the two hemispheres of the brain were separate, and mental deliberation appeared to people as divine inspiration.</p><p>As utterly mad as this theory first sounds, the cultural, psychological, archaeological and linguistic evidence for it is grounds for more than a pause.
