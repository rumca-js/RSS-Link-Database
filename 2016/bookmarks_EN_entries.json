It was the great NPR Tiny Desk Takeover by Blue Man Group.\n\nIf you've not seen this performance ensemble and their production in New York, Las Vegas, Orlando, Boston, Chicago or Berlin, then you've missed a night of magical fun. These Blue Men may never say a word, but the performances make for poignant looks at who we are as humans. They also make unusual music on instruments of their own design.\n\nJosh Rogosin, our engineer for the Tiny Desk, first saw them in their early days, some 25 years ago at New York's Astor Place Theatre. He told me how the Blue Men would retrofit some of their theatrical magic \u2014 including their custom-made instruments, confetti cannons and streamers \u2014 to fit this small desk space.\n\nEvery band that plays the Tiny Desk must work within the restrictions of the space. So instead of installing their entire signature PVC instrument, what ended up behind the desk was about a third of it. On the right side of the desk, their Shred Mill makes its internet debut: It's a drum machine triggered by magnets that changes rhythm depending where they are placed on the home-made variable-speed conveyor belt. They also invented something called a Spinulum, whose rhythmic tempo is controlled by rotating a wheel that plucks steel guitar strings. (You can read a full description on the instruments below.)\n\nIn the end the Blue Men and their dressed-down accompanists performed a Tiny Desk concert like no other. I've been familiar with their music since my days as director of All Things Considered in the 1990s, when I would play their tunes between news stories. Seeing all this come to life (and I know this is true for Josh, as well) was simply unforgettable. From the unique sounds of the PVC to the strumming sounds of the Spinulum to their \"Meditation For Winners\" mantras, you'll get a taste of why this troupe's art is so universal and so much fun.\n\nTHE INSTRUMENTS\n\n(as told to us by the Blue Man Group)\n\nChapman Stick: A combination of a guitar, a bass guitar, and a washboard, the Chapman Stick is 10 strings and all neck. While it can be played with fingers, we often bow the Stick with a bass string. This method, pioneered by Blue Man Group, is called the Mandelbrot Stick Technique.\n\nCimbalom: An old hammered chromatic string instrument from Hungary that we gave a plywood update to. It's normally played gently with soft mallets, but Blue Man Group hits it aggressively with drumsticks.\n\nShredmill: Making its internet debut, this new Blue Man Group creation is a treadmill-shaped, electro-mechanical sequencer that a Blue Man (or anyone else) can use to create rhythmic patterns. Placing and/or moving the Shred Mill's tiny little magnets in order to change the sequence (\"shredding\") is dangerously addictive. If you are ever presented with the opportunity to shred, proceed at your own risk.\n\nSpinulum: Have you ever watched Wheel of Fortune and thought to yourself, \"I wonder what would happen if I took that wheel, shrunk it down to about a foot in diameter, mounted it to a stand, and replaced that little white flipper with steel guitar strings?\" Us too! The Spinulum is a brand new Blue Man Group instrument that is part slide guitar, part bicycle wheel, and 100 percent dynamite!\n\nPVC: Blue Man Group's signature instrument is comprised of several lengths of polyvinyl chloride pipe that make an almost synthesizer-like sound when struck with a closed-cell foam rubber paddle. This performance only includes the center, high-octave section of the PVC. This is not because we have a problem with the other sections of the PVC. We actually really like them. There just wasn't enough space. It's a tiny desk.\n\nMIDI PVC: The signature Blue Man Group PVC instrument shrunk down and electrified.\n\nSET LIST:\n\"Vortex\"\n\"The Forge\"\n\"Meditation For Winners\"\n\nBlue Man Group's Three is available now: \niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/three/id1086603889\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Three-Blue-Man-Group/dp/B01BZGFX5Y\n\nCREDITS:\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Josh Rogosin, Niki Walker; Blue Man Group Producer: Anita Shah; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Niki Walker, Colin Marshall, Nick Michael, Kara Frame, Claire Hannah Collins; Blue Man Group Music & Creative Director: Jeff Turlik; Blue Man Group Director: David Bray; Production Assistant: CJ Riculan; Special Thanks: Blue Man Group Crew; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTJfITfbYNA", "date_published": "2016-10-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://addisstandard.com", "title": "Letter to the Editor: Why Dr. Tedros Adhanom should not lead the World Health Organization - Addis Standard", "description": "Letter to the Editor: Why Dr. Tedros Adhanom should not lead the World Health Organization - Addis Standard", "link": "https://addisstandard.com/letter-editor-dr-tedros-adhanom-not-lead-world-health-organization/", "date_published": "2016-09-27 20:52:39+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["who", "tedros adhanom"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCBHu7LsKiwiYViR230RtsCA", "title": "Black Lives Matter vs All Lives Matter Supporters (Social Experiment)", "description": "Support me here https://www.patreon.com/JoeySalads\nSubscribe to my Political Commentary Podcast Here https://www.youtube.com/user/JoeySalads2\n*LIKE/SUBSCRIBE, New Video Every MONDAY! 917-540-8768*\nWatch Newest video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqeX4GTSLVA\n\nDISCLAIMER: To Adhere to the new youtube guidelines of safety, everyone in this video fully consented and signed a waiver/release form.

Much of their sound is layered atop a soulful hip-hop foundation; from there, your safest bet is to call it a hodgepodge of genres in the best way possible. Guitarist Jose Rios and bassist Kelsey Gonzalez inject a hard-rock edge into the Hi-Tek-produced \"Come Down,\" this set's opening number. When you hear them play the first few jazz chords of \"Heart Don't Stand A Chance,\" it's hard to simply call this R&B.\n\nIt's been a slow build for .Paak, who released a few mixtapes before his 2014 debut album Venice. This year has marked his official breakout with Malibu, on which he did what so many in his position fail to do: He capitalized. After bursting into the spotlight with his appearances on Dr. Dre's Compton LP, he immediately prepped the release of Malibu. The album sculpted an entirely new lane for Anderson .Paak. He can rhyme with best of 'em, and his vocal styling, reminiscent of '70s and '80s greats, is invigorating when set against today's tender R&B elite. Before all that, he's a drummer-slash-bandleader.\n\nI've experienced three separate presentations of this band. First, there's the recorded version, on which .Paak collaborates with some of hip-hop's finest producers. Then, their tight stage show hits you in the chest with 90-plus minutes of pure energy. In the midst of a whirlwind tour, they stopped by the Tiny Desk and reworked three cuts from Malibu, along with an audience request that shocked even them. They stripped down and pulled back just enough to fill the room.\n\nMalibu is available now:\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/malibu/id1065681363?app=itunes&ign-mpt=uo%3D4\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Malibu-Anderson-Paak/dp/B0192ZU8TG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1471013450&sr=8-1&keywords=Anderson+.Paak+malibu+Music\n\nSet List:\n\"Come Down\"\n\"Heart Don't Stand A Chance\"\n\"Put Me Thru\"\n\"Suede\"\n\nCredits:\nProducers: Bobby Carter, Niki Walker, Abby O'Neill; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Niki Walker, Claire Hannah Collins, Nickolai Hammar; Production Assistant: Sophie Kemp; Photo: Cameron Robert/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ferZnZ0_rSM", "date_published": "2016-08-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "title": "Coal Burning Causes the Most Air Pollution Deaths in China, Study Finds", "description": "Coal Burning Causes the Most Air Pollution Deaths in China, Study Finds", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/world/asia/china-coal-health-smog-pollution.html", "date_published": "2016-08-18 07:59:12+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["co2", "climate change", "pollution"]}, {"source": "https://www.eff.org", "title": "With Windows 10, Microsoft Blatantly Disregards User Choice and Privacy: A Deep Dive | Electronic Frontier Foundation", "description": "With Windows 10, Microsoft Blatantly Disregards User Choice and Privacy: A Deep Dive | Electronic Frontier Foundation", "link": "https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/08/windows-10-microsoft-blatantly-disregards-user-choice-and-privacy-deep-dive", "date_published": "2016-08-17 08:55:28+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["privacy", "technofeudalism", "windows", "microsoft"]}, {"source": "https://www.washingtontimes.com", "title": "Black Lives Matter cashes in with $100 million from liberal foundations - Washington Times", "description": "Black Lives Matter cashes in with $100 million from liberal foundations - Washington Times", "link": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/16/black-lives-matter-cashes-100-million-liberal-foun/", "date_published": "2016-08-16 20:44:57+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["politics", "black lives matter", "manufacturing consent"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCOgQVjZAVjwwHKOuBnpqqhg", "title": "Racism in America Small Town 1950s Case Study Documentary Film", "description": "Racism in the United States has been a major issue since the colonial era and the slave era. Legally sanctioned racism imposed a heavy burden on Native Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latin Americans. European Americans (particularly Anglo Americans) were privileged by law in matters of literacy, immigration, voting rights, citizenship, land acquisition, and criminal procedure over periods of time extending from the 17th century to the 1960s. Many non-Protestant European immigrant groups, particularly American Jews, Irish Americans, Italian Americans, as well as other immigrants from elsewhere, suffered xenophobic exclusion and other forms of discrimination in American society.\n\nMajor racially structured institutions included slavery, Indian Wars, Native American reservations, segregation, residential schools (for Native Americans), and internment camps. Formal racial discrimination was largely banned in the mid-20th century, and came to be perceived as socially unacceptable and/or morally repugnant as well, yet racial politics remain a major phenomenon. Historical racism continues to be reflected in socio-economic inequality. Racial stratification continues to occur in employment, housing, education, lending, and government.\n\nThe 20th century saw a hardening of institutionalized racism and legal discrimination against citizens of African descent in the United States. Although technically able to vote, poll taxes, acts of terror (often perpetuated by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, founded in the Reconstruction South), and discriminatory laws such as grandfather clauses kept black Americans disenfranchised particularly in the South but also nationwide following the Hayes election at the end of the Reconstruction era in 1877. In response to de jure racism, protest and lobbyist groups emerged, most notably, the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) in 1909.\n\nThis time period is sometimes referred to as the nadir of American race relations because racism in the United States was worse during this time than at any period before or since. Segregation, racial discrimination, and expressions of white supremacy all increased. So did anti-black violence, including lynchings and race riots.\n\nIn addition, racism which had been viewed primarily as a problem in the Southern states, burst onto the national consciousness following the Great Migration, the relocation of millions of African Americans from their roots in the Southern states to the industrial centers of the North after World War I, particularly in cities such as Boston, Chicago, and New York (Harlem). In northern cities, racial tensions exploded, most violently in Chicago, and lynchings--mob-directed hangings, usually racially motivated\u2014increased dramatically in the 1920s. As a member of the Princeton chapter of the NAACP, Albert Einstein corresponded with W. E. B. Du Bois, and in 1946 Einstein called racism America's \"worst disease.\"\n\nThe Jim Crow Laws were state and local laws enacted in the Southern and border states of the United States and enforced between 1876 and 1965. They mandated \"separate but equal\" status for black Americans. In reality, this led to treatment and accommodations that were almost always inferior to those provided to white Americans. The most important laws required that public schools, public places and public transportation, like trains and buses, have separate facilities for whites and blacks. (These Jim Crow Laws were separate from the 1800-66 Black Codes, which had restricted the civil rights and civil liberties of African Americans.) State-sponsored school segregation was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1954 in Brown v. Board of Education. Generally, the remaining Jim Crow laws were overruled by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act; none were in effect at the end of the 1960s.\n\nSegregation continued even after the demise of the Jim Crow laws. Data on house prices and attitudes toward integration from suggest that in the mid-20th century, segregation was a product of collective actions taken by whites to exclude blacks from their neighborhoods. Segregation also took the form of redlining, the practice of denying or increasing the cost of services, such as banking, insurance, access to jobs, access to health care, or even supermarkets to residents in certain, often racially determined, areas. Although in the United States informal discrimination and segregation have always existed, the practice called \"redlining\" began with the National Housing Act of 1934, which established the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCW58RCgqOQ", "date_published": "2016-08-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["archive"]}, {"source": "https://www.bbc.com", "title": "France church attack: Priest killed by two 'IS militants' - BBC News", "description": "France church attack: Priest killed by two 'IS militants' - BBC News", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36892785", "date_published": "2016-07-26 07:36:49+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-GB", "tags": ["france", "islam", "immigration", "christianophobia"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbL8uh2Fba3lYN-8Ff9h_VQ", "title": "Eric Clapton - Tokyo, Japan (Budokan) - Feb 25 2009 - Full Concert", "description": "There's a related video with just the solos here: https://youtu.be/WtRYVjfBaTw", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eO7oknTaltE", "date_published": "2016-07-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://www.lifezette.com", "title": "The Left\u2019s New Weapon: \u2018Diversity and Inclusion\u2019", "description": "The Left\u2019s New Weapon: \u2018Diversity and Inclusion\u2019", "link": "https://www.lifezette.com/2016/07/lefts-new-weapon-diversity-inclusion/", "date_published": "2016-07-14 15:47:42+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["propaganda", "inclusion", "diversity", "equity"]}, {"source": "https://www.fiercebiotech.com", "title": "Profusa awarded $7.5M DARPA grant to work on implantable biosensors | Fierce Biotech", "description": "Profusa awarded $7.5M DARPA grant to work on implantable biosensors | Fierce Biotech", "link": "https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medical-devices/profusa-awarded-7-5-million-darpa-grant-to-work-implantable-biosensors", "date_published": "2016-07-12 20:14:30+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["biometric", "profusa", "chip"]}, {"source": "https://www.statnews.com", "title": "Pfizer agrees to opioid marketing deal to escape a lawsuit by Chicago - STAT", "description": "Pfizer agrees to opioid marketing deal to escape a lawsuit by Chicago - STAT", "link": "https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2016/07/06/pfizer-opioids-chicago-painkiller/", "date_published": "2016-07-06 20:56:30+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["pfizer", "big pharma"]}, {"source": "https://theintercept.com", "title": "Chilcot Report: Tony Blair Told George W.

Bird's early music, from the late '90s, was steeped in hot jazz and blues music from the early days of the phonograph, then later shifted to new technologies using loop pedals to layer voice, whistling and violin. His lyrics often have a calculated quality, filled with abundant wordplay and observations.\n\nThis year, Bird made one of his most personal albums, Are You Serious. So it felt appropriate that he would play some of his most personal work in this most intimate of settings, the Tiny Desk.\n\nFor this performance of three new songs, Bird came with a stripped-down acoustic band: just drums, upright bass and acoustic guitar, with Bird himself on violin. It functioned something like a hot jazz ensemble, with no effects pedals; just the songs, front and center, sounding perfect.\n\nAre You Serious is available now:\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/are-you-serious/id1079570545\nAmazon: http://www.amazon.com/Are-You-Serious-Andrew-Bird/dp/B01BG0SWIE\n\nSet List:\n\"Are You Serious\"\n\"Roma Fade'\"\n\"Capsized\"\n\nCredits:\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Niki Walker; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Niki Walker, Kara Frame, Colin Marshall; Production Assistant: Jackson Sinnenberg; Photo: Brandon Chew/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGAzPtwUJJU", "date_published": "2016-05-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCVaWPGAQtNEWQEvb7d5jQrw", "title": "\u25ba Best of 8-bit Electro Gaming Mix September 2015 \u25c4 ~(\uffe3\u25bd\uffe3)~ | Xefox Music", "description": "I reuploaded this mix because i love it ~(\uffe3\u25bd\uffe3)~\nXefox Music is the creator of this Mix so credits to him for making such a beautiful mix. \n\nhere the link to Xefox Music: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRs41MXZpAhXgiD4KjTjabg/featured\n\nand to his new 8-bit Mix :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DGh_kjpROk\n\nfor the pic: http://vashperado.deviantart.com/art/s-p-a-c-e-o-u-t-264782890\n\npic with animations : http://imgur.com/N0haYzT\n\nDownload: http://www.mediafire.com/download/6zp2wmad9s5r52j/8-Bit_Electro_Gaming_Mix_Sept_2015__.mp3\n\n\u25baTrackslist\u25c4\n00:00 - Vexento - Pixel Party\n02:49 - Lensko - Cetus\n07:35 - Monstaz. - Popcorn Funk\n11:38 - AdhesiveWombat - 8 Bit Adventure (SpikedGrin Remix)\n15:50 - Dreams - Bitcoin \n19:29 - PrototypeRaptor - Mode 7\n24:14 - Nitro Fun - Final Boss\n29:27 - Televisor - Old Skool (Nitro Fun Remix)\n33:04 - Distrion & Electro-Light - Rubik \n36:23 - Panda Eyes & Teminite - Adventure Time\n42:26 - Loki - Absurdity\n44:43 - Nitro Fun - New Game\n49:01 - TheFatRat - Time Lapse\n52:01 - Panda Eyes - Antipixel\n\n\nAbsolutely no copyright infringement is intended.

What he and his backup singers, The Hamiltones, do would be better classified as a musical purge, with a stage show that can double as couples therapy and church service. Their warm harmonies have the ability to shrink theaters and stadiums, so we knew this intimate setting was perfect for them.\n\nFollowing a spot at the final In Performance show of the Obama presidency, the singer, The Hamiltones and his band made their way over to our offices to give us a dose of what's to come, as well as a heavy helping of what fans have grown to love about him.

In fact, she came to the Tiny Desk with an untitled new one \u2014 since given the name \"Funeral Pyre\" \u2014 and she appropriately introduced it as \"Sad Song #11.\" But Baker's shimmering electric-guitar picking, the purity of her voice and the yearning way she sings make each of her songs lovely and memorable rather than merely somber. She takes raw emotions and weaves them into perfect bits of memorable poetry like this, from the song \"Good News\":\n\nIn the thin air my ribs creak\nLike wooden dining chairs when you see me\nAlways scared that every situation ends the same\nWith a blank stare\n\nFor fans of Torres, another Tennessee musician, there's a similar intensity to that electric guitar and lonesome sound.

When he finished those tunes, he asked the crowd for requests, at which point he banged out two favorites on piano: \"Emaline,\" which dates back to the '80s, and a foot-stomper from his second album with Ben Folds Five, \"One Angry Dwarf And 200 Solemn Faces.\" It's a memorable performance recounting memorable moments from second grade and beyond, as simple and direct as its closing line: \"Kiss my ass.\"\n\nSo There is available now:\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/so-there/id1018447558\nAmazon: http://www.amazon.com/So-There-Ben-Folds/dp/B011KF8BJK\n\nSet List:\n\"Phone In A Pool\"\n\"Not A Fan\"\n\"Capable Of Anything\"\n\"Emaline\"\n\"One Angry Dwarf And 200 Solemn Faces\"\n\nCredits:\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Walker, Niki Walker; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Walker, Julia Reihs; Photo: Jun Tsuboike/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNMms_zGbnI", "date_published": "2016-02-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://www.umweltbundesamt.de", "title": "Lifetime of electrical appliances becoming shorter and shorter", "description": "Reasons for early replacement are varied \u2013 UBA recommends a minimum period of service life", "link": "https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/press/pressinformation/lifetime-of-electrical-appliances-becoming-shorter", "date_published": "2016-02-15 14:27:49+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["climate change", "right to repair"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCg7L1ILzEAbg9XJbFV9fxlA", "title": "Vitas -
