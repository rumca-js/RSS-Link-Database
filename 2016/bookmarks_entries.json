When most people think of anonymity, they usually think of the internet, the trolls who dwell in the comments sections on articles or on Reddit, but the importance of anonymity in America goes back further than you might expect. Benjamin Franklin, James Madison, and other political activists during the American Revolution used anonymous pen names while writing politically controversial books and essays. They concealed their identities to protect themselves from retaliation and ensure that readers judge their work based on the merits of their arguments, not their identity. These works are celebrated today as heroic weapons in the defense of liberty, but without anonymity, the founding fathers would have been hanged for treason for broadcasting their ideas in the 13 colonies.\n\n\n Even though our world is vastly different from 1776, anonymity remains essential today. It offers protection to those who are most at risk of experiencing retaliation for their actions or beliefs such as those who support potentially controversial organizations. As Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens put it, \"Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority.\" For example, in 1956, the Alabama attorney general demanded that the NAACP reveal the names and addresses of all their members as a way to bully them out of the state. This intimidation tactic was appealed all the way to the US Supreme Court and was struck down, but highlights the importance that anonymity played in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n\n Today, in an effort to make the internet more transparent, some want to require internet commenters to reveal their names online, and it's not just the internet, some are pushing for legislation that would force causes and advocacy groups to reveal the identities of anonymous supporters. While this may sound like a good idea on the surface, anonymity is crucial for a meaningful right to free speech. When we think about anonymity, we often think about its negative uses, but fail to consider the LGBTQ student seeking confidential advice about coming out to their parents, the young pregnant woman seeking reproductive health, the depressed college student seeking mental health support from an online community, or someone with a controversial political opinion who supports a cause.\n\n\n The first amendment protects speech and privacy regardless of whether the speech is culturally accepted or rejected. Every American has the right to privacy and anonymity. Without it, anyone with unpopular things to say would feel less safe saying those things. What do you think?

Legally sanctioned racism imposed a heavy burden on Native Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latin Americans. European Americans (particularly Anglo Americans) were privileged by law in matters of literacy, immigration, voting rights, citizenship, land acquisition, and criminal procedure over periods of time extending from the 17th century to the 1960s. Many non-Protestant European immigrant groups, particularly American Jews, Irish Americans, Italian Americans, as well as other immigrants from elsewhere, suffered xenophobic exclusion and other forms of discrimination in American society.\n\nMajor racially structured institutions included slavery, Indian Wars, Native American reservations, segregation, residential schools (for Native Americans), and internment camps. Formal racial discrimination was largely banned in the mid-20th century, and came to be perceived as socially unacceptable and/or morally repugnant as well, yet racial politics remain a major phenomenon. Historical racism continues to be reflected in socio-economic inequality. Racial stratification continues to occur in employment, housing, education, lending, and government.\n\nThe 20th century saw a hardening of institutionalized racism and legal discrimination against citizens of African descent in the United States. Although technically able to vote, poll taxes, acts of terror (often perpetuated by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, founded in the Reconstruction South), and discriminatory laws such as grandfather clauses kept black Americans disenfranchised particularly in the South but also nationwide following the Hayes election at the end of the Reconstruction era in 1877. In response to de jure racism, protest and lobbyist groups emerged, most notably, the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) in 1909.\n\nThis time period is sometimes referred to as the nadir of American race relations because racism in the United States was worse during this time than at any period before or since. Segregation, racial discrimination, and expressions of white supremacy all increased. So did anti-black violence, including lynchings and race riots.\n\nIn addition, racism which had been viewed primarily as a problem in the Southern states, burst onto the national consciousness following the Great Migration, the relocation of millions of African Americans from their roots in the Southern states to the industrial centers of the North after World War I, particularly in cities such as Boston, Chicago, and New York (Harlem). In northern cities, racial tensions exploded, most violently in Chicago, and lynchings--mob-directed hangings, usually racially motivated\u2014increased dramatically in the 1920s. As a member of the Princeton chapter of the NAACP, Albert Einstein corresponded with W. E. B. Du Bois, and in 1946 Einstein called racism America's \"worst disease.\"\n\nThe Jim Crow Laws were state and local laws enacted in the Southern and border states of the United States and enforced between 1876 and 1965. They mandated \"separate but equal\" status for black Americans. In reality, this led to treatment and accommodations that were almost always inferior to those provided to white Americans. The most important laws required that public schools, public places and public transportation, like trains and buses, have separate facilities for whites and blacks. (These Jim Crow Laws were separate from the 1800-66 Black Codes, which had restricted the civil rights and civil liberties of African Americans.) State-sponsored school segregation was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1954 in Brown v. Board of Education. Generally, the remaining Jim Crow laws were overruled by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act; none were in effect at the end of the 1960s.\n\nSegregation continued even after the demise of the Jim Crow laws. Data on house prices and attitudes toward integration from suggest that in the mid-20th century, segregation was a product of collective actions taken by whites to exclude blacks from their neighborhoods. Segregation also took the form of redlining, the practice of denying or increasing the cost of services, such as banking, insurance, access to jobs, access to health care, or even supermarkets to residents in certain, often racially determined, areas. Although in the United States informal discrimination and segregation have always existed, the practice called \"redlining\" began with the National Housing Act of 1934, which established the Federal Housing Administration (FHA)."}, {"page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": true, "title": "SwiftKey suspends cloud syncing after private data leak", "artist": null, "language": "en", "comments": [], "user": "rumpel", "dead": false, "album": null, "page_rating": 0, "permanent": false, "vote": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "age": 0, "link": "https://www.androidauthority.com/swiftkey-suspends-service-data-leak-706680", "source": "https://www.androidauthority.com", "tags": ["cloud computing", "data leak"], "date_published": "2016-07-31T15:12:58+00:00", "page_rating_votes": 0, "thumbnail": null, "description": "SwiftKey suspends cloud syncing after private data leak"}, {"page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": true, "title": "France church attack: Priest killed by two 'IS militants' - BBC News", "artist": null, "language": "en-GB", "comments": [], "user": "rumpel", "dead": false, "album": null, "page_rating": 0, "permanent": false, "vote": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "age": 0, "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36892785", "source": "https://www.bbc.com", "tags": ["christianophobia", "france", "islam", "immigration", "religion"], "date_published": "2016-07-26T07:36:49+00:00", "page_rating_votes": 0, "thumbnail": null, "description": "France church attack: Priest killed by two 'IS militants' - BBC News"}, {"page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": true, "title": "The Left\u2019s New Weapon: \u2018Diversity and Inclusion\u2019", "artist": null, "language": "en-US", "comments": [], "user": null, "dead": false, "album": null, "page_rating": 0, "permanent": false, "vote": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "age": 0, "link": "https://www.lifezette.com/2016/07/lefts-new-weapon-diversity-inclusion", "source": "https://www.lifezette.com", "tags": ["equity", "diversity", "inclusion", "propaganda"], "date_published": "2016-07-14T15:47:42+00:00", "page_rating_votes": 0, "thumbnail": null, "description": "The Left\u2019s New Weapon: \u2018Diversity and Inclusion\u2019"}, {"page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": true, "title": "Profusa awarded $7.5M DARPA grant to work on implantable biosensors | Fierce Biotech", "artist": null, "language": "en", "comments": [], "user": "rumpel", "dead": false, "album": null, "page_rating": 0, "permanent": false, "vote": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "age": 0, "link": "https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medical-devices/profusa-awarded-7-5-million-darpa-grant-to-work-implantable-biosensors", "source": "https://www.fiercebiotech.com", "tags": ["chip", "profusa", "biometric"], "date_published": "2016-07-12T20:14:30+00:00", "page_rating_votes": 0, "thumbnail": null, "description": "Profusa awarded $7.5M DARPA grant to work on implantable biosensors | Fierce Biotech"}, {"page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": true, "title": "Pfizer agrees to opioid marketing deal to escape a lawsuit by Chicago - STAT", "artist": null, "language": "en-US", "comments": [], "user": "rumpel", "dead": false, "album": null, "page_rating": 0, "permanent": false, "vote": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "age": 0, "link": "https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2016/07/06/pfizer-opioids-chicago-painkiller", "source": "https://www.statnews.com", "tags": ["big pharma", "pfizer"], "date_published": "2016-07-06T20:56:30+00:00", "page_rating_votes": 0, "thumbnail": null, "description": "Pfizer agrees to opioid marketing deal to escape a lawsuit by Chicago - STAT"}, {"page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": true, "title": "Chilcot Report: Tony Blair Told George W.

It is a full-time sport in tribal societies.\n[McManus]But, I had some idea as we got global and tribal we were going to try to -\n\n[McLuhan]The closer you get together, the more you like each other? There is no evidence of that in any situation that we have ever heard of. When people get close together, they get more and more savage and impatient with each other.\n\n[McManus]Why is it? Is it because of the nature of man?\n[McLuhan]His tolerance is tested in those narrow circumstances very much. Village people are not that much in love with each other. The global village is a place of a very arduous interfaces and very abrasive situations.\n\n[McManus]Do you see any pattern of this in, for example the desires of Quebec to separate?\n\n[McLuhan]I should think that they are feeling very abrasive about the English community and about the way the American south felt about the Yankee north a hundred years ago.\n\n[McManus]Is this going to be a pattern right around the world?\n\n[McLuhan]Apparently, separatisms are very frequent all over the globe at the present time. Every country in the world is loaded with regionalistic and nationalistic little groups.\n\n[McManus]But in Quebec for example, like do you define it as the quest for identity?\n\n[McLuhan]Yes, all forms of violence are quests for identity. When you live out on the frontier, you have no identity. You are a nobody. Therefore, you get very tough. You have to prove that you are somebody. So you become very violent. Identity is always accompanied by violence. This seems paradoxical to you? Ordinary people find the need for violence as they lose their identities. It is only the threat to people\u2019s identity that makes them violent. Terrorists, hijackers - these are people minus identity. They are determined to make it somehow, to get coverage, to get noticed.\n\n[McManus]And all this is somehow an effect of the electronic age?\n\n[McLuhan]No, but people in all times have been this way. In our time, when things happen very quickly, there\u2019s very little time to adjust to new situations at the speed of light. There is little time to get accustomed to anything. Even radio has sent tribal societies around theglobe up the wall with intensity of feeling. One of the major violence makers of our century has been radio. Hitler was entirely a radio man and a tribal man.\n\n[McManus]Then, what does television do to that tribal man?\n\n[McLuhan]Well, I don\u2019t think Hitler would have lasted long on TV. Like Senator Joe McCarthy, he would have looked foolish. McCarthy was a very hot character and like Nixon, he made a very bad image on television. He was far too hot a character. He would have been much better on radio.\n\n[McManus]The investigations now of the CIA, the FBI and even our own, God forbid, RCMP, has this anything to do with the electronic age?\n\n[McLuhan]Yes, because we now have the means to keep everybody under surveillance. No matter what part of the world they are in, we can put them under surveillance. This has become one of the main occupations of mankind, just watching other people and keeping a record of their goings on.\n\n[McManus]And invading privacy.\n\n[McLuhan]Yes, in fact, just ignoring it. Everybody has become porous. The light and the the message go right through us. At this moment, we are on the air. We do not have any physical body. When you\u2019re on the telephone or on radio or on T.V., you don\u2019t have a physical body - you\u2019re just an image on the air. When you don\u2019t have a physical body, you\u2019re a discarnate being. You have a very different relation to the world around you. I think this has been one of the big effects of the electric age. It has deprived people really of their identity.\n[McManus]So that\u2019s what this is doing to me?\n\nMore information:\n\nTranscripts: https://hotbookworm.wordpress.com/2016/06/03/marshall-mcluhan-1977-violence-as-quest-for-identity/"}, {"page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": true, "title": "Is my phone powered by child labour? - Amnesty International", "artist": null, "language": "en", "comments": [], "user": "rumpel", "dead": false, "album": null, "page_rating": 0, "permanent": false, "vote": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "age": 0, "link": "https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2016/06/drc-cobalt-child-labour", "source": "https://www.amnesty.org", "tags": ["smartphone", "hardware", "slave labour"], "date_published": "2016-06-01T11:21:53+00:00", "page_rating_votes": 0, "thumbnail": null, "description": "Is my phone powered by child labour? - Amnesty International"}, {"page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": true, "title": "'Windows 10 nagware: You can't click X.
