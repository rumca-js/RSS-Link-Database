When I heard about it, I asked, \"What did the fax say?\"  Parody ensued.\n\nHere's an article about North Korea's threatening fax to South Korea - \nhttp://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/12/north-korea-sends-very-threatening-message-by-fax/\nRead about Kim Jong Un and Dennis Rodman's bromance - http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/02/dennis-rodman-north-korea-kim-jong-un\n\nSTEVEN'S NOTES:\nMaking a parody of Ylvis' comedy music video seems like a thing I wouldn't ever do...   but Toby told me it was funny, so I laughed.  Apparently Dennis Rodman is good friends with Kim Jong Un, so hopefully this spoof doesn't offend him.  If it does, I might be able to sneak my way into Tobuscus' will.  What does the will say?  Hahahah.. I laughed way too hard at myself just now.\n\nKim Jong Un's\nStressing out.\n\nKilled his uncle just last week.\n\nPyongyang sucks.  Communism blows.\nDennis Rodman doesn't know.\nThey want to kill like everyone.\nKim Jon Un goes Mu Ha Ha.\n\nThey send a note the way they know how.\n\nWhat does the fax say?\n\nBEEP brrbrbrrb\n\nWHAT THE FAX SAY?\n\nBeep BRB BEEP BA DEE BEEP\n\nWHAT THE FAX SAY?\n\nNo paper have to reload (repeat)\n\nWHAT THE FAX SAY?\n\nMurder murder everyone kill kill kill murder gonna die.\n\nMur murder kill kill kill kill murder kill\n\nWHAT THE FAX SAY?\n\nIs it wise for me to post\nthis parody video?\n\nIf they saw, they would kill\neveryone I'd ever known.\n\nFortunately, they do not have\nany access to YouTube.\nCause it was banned by Kim Jong Un's dad.\n\nIf you're caught they'll use deadly for or or or orce\n\nThere are exceptions of cour our our our our ourse.\n\nWhat does the fax say?\n\nBack in my day I was awesome.  Used to be all the rage.  People used to fax but not anymore.\n\nWHAT THE FAX SAY?\n\nSomeone just please use me.  I will send a fax for free.  Just please please please use me I'm lonely.\n\nBEE A HEE A HEE\n\nSHUT UP FAX\n\nSorry\n\nWHAT THE FAX SAY?\n\nSomeone USE MEEEEE\n\nWHAT DOES THE FAX SAY?\n\nThe thing about the fax.  It is obsolete.\nNo one uses them anymore. Not since the 90s.\n\nWe use computers now.  Can I send you a phone?\nYou can have my old iPhone 3.  But there's no retinal display.\n\nBut you'll probably be okay though.\n\nIt's relatively really good.\n\nYou'll have the best phone in town.\n\n(I want dat display tho.  The retinal display tho.)\n\nFor us it's pretty slow.\n\nI want to ship my obsolete iPhone to your home.\n\n(gimme the good display tho.)\n\nWritten/Sung by Toby Turner / Tobuscus\nInstrumentals by Terabrite - http://youtube.com/terabrite  \n\n\u00a9 2013 Tobuscus", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxDgQJBVJxg", "date_published": "2013-12-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["music", "funny"]}, {"source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "title": "Five Eyes", "description": "Five Eyes", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes", "date_published": "2013-12-21 14:41:21+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["surveillance", "nsa", "five eyes"]}, {"source": "https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/20/5231006/nsa-paid-10-million-for-a-back-door-into-rsa-encryption-according-to", "title": "NSA paid $10 million to put its backdoor in RSA encryption, according to Reuters report", "description": "NSA paid $10 million to put its backdoor in RSA encryption, according to Reuters report", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/20/5231006/nsa-paid-10-million-for-a-back-door-into-rsa-encryption-according-to", "date_published": "2013-12-20 17:23:06+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["surveillance", "nsa", "big brother", "privacy"]}, {"source": "https://www.reuters.com", "title": "Exclusive: Secret contract tied NSA and security industry pioneer | Reuters", "description": "Exclusive: Secret contract tied NSA and security industry pioneer | Reuters", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-rsa-idUSBRE9BJ1C220131220", "date_published": "2013-12-20 07:26:32+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["privacy", "surveillance", "manufacturing consent", "big brother", "nsa", "encryption", "crypto wars"]}, {"source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "title": "PRISM", "description": "test", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM", "date_published": "2013-12-11 20:58:07+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["surveillance", "big brother", "all time"]}, {"source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "title": "Global surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present)", "description": "test", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)", "date_published": "2013-12-11 20:57:41+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["surveillance", "all time"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCBpH9uGYnjck8xHuD3xH1qQ", "title": "The Fountain Explained - A Theory/Explanation on the Plot of The Fountain", "description": "The Fountain Explained - A Theory/Explanation on the Plot of The Fountain", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdzlCZ69APc", "date_published": "2013-12-04 20:21:28+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-EN", "tags": ["fountain", "movies"]}, {"source": "https://www.zdnet.com", "title": "NSA spies on its own 'Five-Eyes' spy partners", "description": "NSA spies on its own 'Five-Eyes' spy partners", "link": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/nsa-spies-on-its-own-five-eyes-spy-partners/", "date_published": "2013-11-20 14:40:44+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["five eyes", "surveillance", "nsa"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCoBKu5XNqQkPIRv0QYSVeKQ", "title": "Lazerhawk ~ Redline Full Album", "description": "I couldn't find this album anywhere in its entirety, so I made and posted this baby.
