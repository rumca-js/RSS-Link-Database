It spawned several sequels, including Pinball Fantasies, Pinball Illusions and Slam Tilt.\n\nThe game's four tables each had a theme, as do most real life pinball & Panchinko machines. The version of Pinball Dreams bundled with the Amiga 1200 had a bug which rendered most of Beat Box's advanced features non-functional.\n\n\"Ignition\", themed around a rocket launch, planets, and space exploration. The Expert Software's Pinball 2000 port of the game renamed this table \"Rocket\".\n\n\"Steel Wheel\", themed around steam trains and the Old West.\n\n\"Beat Box\", themed around the music industry, charts, bands and tours.\n\n\"Nightmare\", themed around a graveyard, ghosts, demons, nightmares and generally evil things. Unlike the other tables in the game, the name of the table in the menu did not reflect the name displayed on the table itself\u2014\"Graveyard\".
