She was 18 when I first saw her in New York City, and now the Norwegian singer is 19; take a look at this Tiny Desk Concert, and her sense of innocence and discovery still rings as true as ever.\n\nAurora has just one EP and some singles out so far, and ever since seeing her at CMJ in 2014, I've been eager for her debut album. Early next year, we should finally have it \u2014 as well as more chances to see Aurora live, as she plans on touring the U.S. in the spring.\n\nRunning With The Wolves is available now. iTunes:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/running-with-the-wolves-ep/id987008667\nAmazon: http://www.amazon.com/Running-With-Wolves-Ep-AURORA/dp/B00WTJK47Y\n\nSet List\n\"Runaway\"\n\"Murder Song (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)\"\n\"Running With The Wolves\"\n\nCredits\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Walker; Audio Engineer: Brian Jarboe; Videographers: Morgan Walker, Morgan McCloy; Production Assistant: Lani Milton; Photo by Hadas/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desks, subscribe to our podcast:\nhttp://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evBgLWQwAFA", "date_published": "2015-11-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC1mFW0Nibo8d6eh9_abm31w", "title": "How to Control What People Do | Propaganda - EDWARD BERNAYS | Animated Book Summary", "description": "How to Control What People Do | Propaganda - EDWARD BERNAYS | Animated Book Summary", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q-3qwEDyPM", "date_published": "2015-10-26 16:07:21+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["edward bernays", "disinformation", "misinformation", "propaganda"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert", "description": "October 09, 2015 by PATRICK JARENWATTANANON \nArtists don't usually tell long, rambling stories at the Tiny Desk, and if they do, those stories don't usually make the final cut. But this one felt different. It was about the time Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah, a young black man, says he was stopped by New Orleans police late at night for no reason other than to harass and intimidate him. And how his pride almost made him do something ill-advised about it. And how he finally channeled that pent-up frustration into a piece of music whose long-form title is \"Ku Klux Police Department.\"\n\n\"K.K.P.D.\" was the emotional peak of the septet's performance, though it wasn't a new tune. That's notable, because Scott stopped by the Tiny Desk on the very day his new album came out. It was played by something of a new band, though: Flutist Elena Pinderhughes, saxophonist Braxton Cook and guitarist Dominic Minix are new, younger additions to the group. It had new textures, too: Drummer Corey Fonville (another new member) used a djembe as a bass drum, and also brought a MIDI pad so he could emulate the sound of a drum machine. The effect was something like an evocation of African roots, juxtaposed with a trap beat.\n\nThe first two numbers were, in fact, from Scott's new album Stretch Music. That's his name for the particular type of jazz fusion he's up to: something more seamless than a simple collision of genre signifiers; something whose DNA is already hybridized and freely admits sonic elements which potentially \"stretch\" jazz's purported boundaries. (You may note that he showed up in a Joy Division sleeveless T-shirt and gold chain.) It's sleek and clearly modern, awash in guitar riffs, but also bold and emotionally naked. Scott is particularly good at getting you to feel the energy he sends pulsing through his horn, and he never shies away from going all-in on a solo. The least we could offer was to let him explain himself in doing so.\n\nStretch Music is available now. \niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/stretch-music-introducing/id1024394279\nAmazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01399S7GC?keywords=christian%20scott%20stretch%20music&qid=1444351505&ref_=sr_1_1&sr=8-1\n\nSet List\n\"TWIN\"\n\"West Of The West\"\n\"K.K.P.D.\"\n\nPersonnel\nChristian Scott aTunde Adjuah, trumpet; Elena Pinderhughes, flute; Braxton Cook, alto saxophone; Lawrence Fields, piano; Dominic Minix, guitar; Kris Funn, bass; Corey Fonville, percussion\n\nCredits\nProducers: Patrick Jarenwattananon, Morgan Walker; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographer: Morgan Walker, Nick Michael, Cameron Robert; Production Assistant: Julia Reihs; photo by Julia Reihs\n\nFor more Tiny Desk Concerts, subscribe to our podcast:\nhttp://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVJjmyFfuts", "date_published": "2015-10-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCHuLYgw4dGbC2BuZQqPWV1g", "title": "Noam Chomsky - Manufacturing Consent", "description": "Noam Chomsky - Manufacturing Consent", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTBWfkE7BXU", "date_published": "2015-10-15 16:13:28+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["noam chomsky", "corporatocracy", "manufacturing consent", "social media", "propaganda", "all time"]}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "The Website Obesity Crisis", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm\">https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm</a></p><p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34466910\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34466910</a></p><p>Points: 36</p><p># Comments: 6</p>", "link": "https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm", "date_published": "2015-10-09 15:10:49+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["internet", "webdev"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC_DzFn0bLaSR_EvaAh8FKZA", "title": "Pinball Dreams (PC/DOS) 1992, 21th Century Entertainment, Spidersoft", "description": "Pinball Dreams is a pinball simulation video game developed by Digital Illusions CE (DICE) and originally released for the Amiga in 1992.

As a singer, he once led the bluegrass band The SteelDrivers, and more recently stepped into the solo spotlight with Traveller, his debut album. It's the kind of country record that gets better the more you wear it in: When NPR Music named it one of our favorite albums of the first half of 2015, critic Ann Powers compared it to a \"soft denim jacket ... pulled out time after time, lending comfort, suiting every occasion, with treasure stuffed in every pocket.\"\n\nIt's easy to understand why other singers took to his songs \u2014 Stapleton writes lyrics that sound classic but never dated \u2014 but his softly creaking voice gives them the home they deserve. And even though those songs stand plenty well on their own, it's nice to have a little support. When Stapleton stepped behind the Tiny Desk to play selections from Traveller, he was joined by his wife Morgane on harmony vocals. Between patient, detailed songs of devotion to love, Los Angeles and liquor, they paused for banter about the summer heat in D.C. and the large number of guitars Chris owns (\"Not supposed to tell that part,\" he said to Morgane).\n\nWatch him hide behind a large hat, a beard and a battered vintage guitar; watch her smile at him during \"More Of You\" with a combination of admiration and affection. Like the songs themselves, their performance is full of private moments worth sharing widely.\n\nTraveller is available now.

I'm not a pop music lover, not a lover of songs with obvious hooks, so when I heard the big fat chorus that starts off Genevieve's \"Colors,\" I thought, \"uh-oh.\" What wound up drawing me in first was her voice \u2014 powerful with a tiny bit of rasp and a sweet smile in her phrasing. And then that perfectly positive message, worded in a way that gave me chills:\n\"Your life is your design, so go ahead design it. Your star is in the sky, so go ahead align it. Cause you're forever lost until you go and find it.\"\nThe truth in those words needed to be shouted from rooftops and that chorus, that hooky thing that generally is my turnoff, became a giant turn-on. Then I went and saw Genevieve perform on a sunny day outdoors in Austin. That SXSW performance gave me a new glimpse of her talent, especially the many ways she could sing, all with great conviction. So I invited her to my desk and she came armed not with the band she had in Austin but simply with an accompanist, Chris Faller, and her voice. To anyone in that room \u2014 and for you watching this Tiny Desk \u2014 her promise is undeniable.\n\nSet list\n\"Colors\" 1:03\n\"The Enemy\" 5:56 \n\"Authority\" 10:09\n\nCredits\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Maggie Starbard; Audio Engineer: Neil Tevault; Videographers: Maggie Starbard, Morgan McCloy; Production Assistant: Annie Bartholomew; photo by Morgan McCloy/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ4Hum70sTk", "date_published": "2015-06-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "www.cbsnews.com", "title": "4 reasons YouTube still doesn't make a profit", "description": "", "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/4-reasons-youtube-still-doesnt-make-a-profit/", "date_published": "2015-05-27 12:04:50+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["youtube", "algorithm"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC5hWk56PCwg1D11kDgtMg_w", "title": "A old man's advice", "description": "A old man's advice", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhckVlgYZJE", "date_published": "2015-05-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["motivation"]}, {"source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "title": "Why Don't We Hear About Soros' Ties to Over 30 Major News Organizations? | Fox News", "description": "Why Don't We Hear About Soros' Ties to Over 30 Major News Organizations? | Fox News", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/why-dont-we-hear-about-soros-ties-to-over-30-major-news-organizations", "date_published": "2015-05-07 12:40:31+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["manufacturing consent", "elites", "george soros", "media", "billionaires"]}, {"source": "https://www.pewresearch.org", "title": "5 key takeaways from State of the News Media 2015 | Pew Research Center", "description": "5 key takeaways from State of the News Media 2015 | Pew Research Center", "link": "https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/29/5-key-takeaways-from-state-of-the-news-media-2015/", "date_published": "2015-04-29 14:09:05+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["digital media", "digital transformation", "legacy media", "media"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "DakhaBrakha: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert", "description": "People always ask me, \"What's your favorite Tiny Desk Concert?\" Well, right now it's the one recently performed by DakhaBrakha. The creative quartet from Kiev, Ukraine make music that sounds like nothing I've ever heard, with strands of everything I've ever heard. There are rhythms that sound West African and drone that feels as if it could have emanated from India or Australia. At times, DakhaBrakha is simply a rock band whose crazy homeland harmonies are filled with joy. All the while, they play tight-knit tunes featuring accordion, drums, reeds and shakers while wearing tall, Marge Simpson-looking wool hats that made me jealous.\n\nI want the world to see this Tiny Desk Concert more than any other right now.

For his winning submission, he performed \"Lost In A Crowd\" in a freight elevator in Oakland. It was his passion, his voice and his backing band that landed him an invitation to perform behind my desk. We're proud of our choice.\n\nAs we learned after choosing him as our winner, Fantastic Negrito \u2014 a.k.a. Xavier Dphrepaulezz, pronounced dee-FREP-ah-lez \u2014 has a remarkable backstory. One of 15 children, he grew up in a strict home, and later signed a contract with Interscope Records in the '90s. That deal fell apart, though, and soured him on music-making. Then, a near-fatal car crash put him in a coma, and eventually left him without the proper use of his hands; he struggled with physical therapy for years to get some movement from what he now calls \"The Claw.\"\n\nThese days, bolstered by a new outlook on life and music, he's reawakened and reemerged under the name Fantastic Negrito. You'll see that newly rediscovered purpose in his eyes and hear it in his voice, as he performs this Tiny Desk Concert with his fantastic band. -- BOB BOILEN\n\nSet List\n\"Lost In A Crowd\" 0:00\n\"Night Has Turned To Day\" 6:30\n\"An Honest Man\"  9:51\n\nCredits\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Maggie Starbard; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Colin Marshall, Nick Michael, Maggie Starbard; Assistant Producer: Morgan McCloy; photo by Morgan McCloy/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYjwsFz8iM", "date_published": "2015-03-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCTyEKPXJjmtpYentN9gen7Q", "title": "J.S.

Bach's most infamous and popular works. I first had the idea of playing this piece in 2013 after hearing an old Russian transcription performed by the incredible Varvara Ivanova, but couldn't get hold of that version due to it being out of print. I loved the power this piece brings to the harp and was determined to try it for myself as I'm a huge fan of anything where I get to play LOUD! The process of adapting the piece for the harp and preparing for this performance took 18 months and many, many practice hours! Its first public performance was as the opening piece of my Masters final recital at the Royal Academy of Music, London in July 2014. Yes I know, how crazy was I to open my recital with this...I then had to play for a further 35 minutes!\n\nAll notes in this transcription are Bach's - there are a few moments where certain notes have been omitted where it was impossible to play, but nothing has been added or embellished in terms of pitches or rhythms. My aim in transcribing this was to be as accurate and respectful to the original as I possibly could, whilst also exploring the greater dynamic possibilities with regards to quiets, crescendos and diminuendos that are possible on the harp. I absolutely loved recreating the sound of different manuals/stops in certain repeated passages of the fugue - this is achieved by playing lower in the strings before returning back to the middle where I'd normally play.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#jsbach #toccata #baroque", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPmKRtWta4E", "date_published": "2015-02-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["music"]}, {"source": "https://preslav.me", "title": "What\u2019s with the 50/72 rule?", "description": "What\u2019s with the 50/72 rule?", "link": "https://preslav.me/2015/02/21/what-s-with-the-50-72-rule/", "date_published": "2015-02-21 09:57:43+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-us", "tags": ["programming", "git"]}, {"source": "https://www.gawker.com", "title": "Billionaire Pervert Jeffrey Epstein and His Famous Friends: A Primer", "description": "Billionaire Pervert Jeffrey Epstein and His Famous Friends: A Primer", "link": "https://www.gawker.com/billionaire-pervert-jeffrey-epstein-and-his-famous-frie-1679246399", "date_published": "2015-01-22 19:55:29+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-EN", "tags": ["billionairs", "jeffrey epstein", "elites"]}, {"source": "https://allthatsinteresting.com", "title": "Chinese Cancer Villages Show The High Human Cost Of Industrialization", "description": "Chinese Cancer Villages Show The High Human Cost Of Industrialization", "link": "https://allthatsinteresting.com/chinese-cancer-villages", "date_published": "2015-01-22 08:04:30+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["co2", "climate change", "pollution"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCp-KSsgIfeYZe5bh5xYymbA", "title": "Fury Of The Furries OST -
