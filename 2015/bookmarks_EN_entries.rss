<item><title>![CDATA[Aurora: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert]]</title><description>![CDATA[November 09, 2015 by BOB BOILEN  The first time I saw Aurora sing, it appeared so new to her that each note, and each hand gesture accompanying each note, seemed like a discovery and an adventure for the singer. She was 18 when I first saw her in New York City, and now the Norwegian singer is 19; take a look at this Tiny Desk Concert, and her sense of innocence and discovery still rings as true as ever.

Aurora has just one EP and some singles out so far, and ever since seeing her at CMJ in 2014, I've been eager for her debut album. Early next year, we should finally have it — as well as more chances to see Aurora live, as she plans on touring the U.S. in the spring.

<item><title>![CDATA[Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert]]</title><description>![CDATA[October 09, 2015 by PATRICK JARENWATTANANON 
Artists don't usually tell long, rambling stories at the Tiny Desk, and if they do, those stories don't usually make the final cut. But this one felt different. It was about the time Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah, a young black man, says he was stopped by New Orleans police late at night for no reason other than to harass and intimidate him. And how his pride almost made him do something ill-advised about it. And how he finally channeled that pent-up frustration into a piece of music whose long-form title is "Ku Klux Police Department."

"K.K.P.D." was the emotional peak of the septet's performance, though it wasn't a new tune. That's notable, because Scott stopped by the Tiny Desk on the very day his new album came out. It was played by something of a new band, though: Flutist Elena Pinderhughes, saxophonist Braxton Cook and guitarist Dominic Minix are new, younger additions to the group. It had new textures, too: Drummer Corey Fonville (another new member) used a djembe as a bass drum, and also brought a MIDI pad so he could emulate the sound of a drum machine. The effect was something like an evocation of African roots, juxtaposed with a trap beat.

The first two numbers were, in fact, from Scott's new album Stretch Music. That's his name for the particular type of jazz fusion he's up to: something more seamless than a simple collision of genre signifiers; something whose DNA is already hybridized and freely admits sonic elements which potentially "stretch" jazz's purported boundaries. (You may note that he showed up in a Joy Division sleeveless T-shirt and gold chain.) It's sleek and clearly modern, awash in guitar riffs, but also bold and emotionally naked. Scott is particularly good at getting you to feel the energy he sends pulsing through his horn, and he never shies away from going all-in on a solo. The least we could offer was to let him explain himself in doing so.

Stretch Music is available now.

<item><title>![CDATA[Pinball Dreams (PC/DOS) 1992, 21th Century Entertainment, Spidersoft]]</title><description>![CDATA[Pinball Dreams is a pinball simulation video game developed by Digital Illusions CE (DICE) and originally released for the Amiga in 1992. It spawned several sequels, including Pinball Fantasies, Pinball Illusions and Slam Tilt.

The game's four tables each had a theme, as do most real life pinball & Panchinko machines. The version of Pinball Dreams bundled with the Amiga 1200 had a bug which rendered most of Beat Box's advanced features non-functional.

"Ignition", themed around a rocket launch, planets, and space exploration. The Expert Software's Pinball 2000 port of the game renamed this table "Rocket".

"Steel Wheel", themed around steam trains and the Old West.

"Beat Box", themed around the music industry, charts, bands and tours.

"Nightmare", themed around a graveyard, ghosts, demons, nightmares and generally evil things. Unlike the other tables in the game, the name of the table in the menu did not reflect the name displayed on the table itself—"Graveyard". Some ports of the game (notably the GameTek port to the Game Boy) name this table "Graveyard" in the menu as well.]]</description><pubDate>2015-10-09 00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSaohyJ_E2w</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSaohyJ_E2w</guid>

Much has happened for Gina Chavez since I first saw her at an unofficial SXSW showcase about five years ago: two albums, fan and industry recognition, this year's Austin Music Award for Austin Musician Of The Year. Chavez's music has developed over the years, just as it should.

What hasn't changed is the intense openness and warmth of her performances. From that hot spring afternoon in Austin to this recent Tiny Desk Concert, it always feels as if she's performing just for me. And, of course, you get the sense that everyone else in the audience feels the same. See for yourself, and if you don't know her already, I dare you to walk away and not become a fan.

<item><title>![CDATA[Chris Stapleton: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert]]</title><description>![CDATA[September 14, 2015 by JACOB GANZ 
As a songwriter in Nashville, Chris Stapleton has written hits for Kenny Chesney, George Strait and Darius Rucker. As a singer, he once led the bluegrass band The SteelDrivers, and more recently stepped into the solo spotlight with Traveller, his debut album. It's the kind of country record that gets better the more you wear it in: When NPR Music named it one of our favorite albums of the first half of 2015, critic Ann Powers compared it to a "soft denim jacket ... pulled out time after time, lending comfort, suiting every occasion, with treasure stuffed in every pocket."

It's easy to understand why other singers took to his songs — Stapleton writes lyrics that sound classic but never dated — but his softly creaking voice gives them the home they deserve. And even though those songs stand plenty well on their own, it's nice to have a little support. When Stapleton stepped behind the Tiny Desk to play selections from Traveller, he was joined by his wife Morgane on harmony vocals. Between patient, detailed songs of devotion to love, Los Angeles and liquor, they paused for banter about the summer heat in D.C. and the large number of guitars Chris owns ("Not supposed to tell that part," he said to Morgane).

Watch him hide behind a large hat, a beard and a battered vintage guitar; watch her smile at him during "More Of You" with a combination of admiration and affection. Like the songs themselves, their performance is full of private moments worth sharing widely.

Traveller is available now. (iTunes) (Amazon)

Set List
"More Of You"
"When The Stars Come Out"

<item><title>![CDATA[Genevieve: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert]]</title><description>![CDATA[It's often true that the songs we wind up loving most are the ones that surprise us. I'm not a pop music lover, not a lover of songs with obvious hooks, so when I heard the big fat chorus that starts off Genevieve's "Colors," I thought, "uh-oh." What wound up drawing me in first was her voice — powerful with a tiny bit of rasp and a sweet smile in her phrasing. And then that perfectly positive message, worded in a way that gave me chills:
"Your life is your design, so go ahead design it. Your star is in the sky, so go ahead align it. Cause you're forever lost until you go and find it."
The truth in those words needed to be shouted from rooftops and that chorus, that hooky thing that generally is my turnoff, became a giant turn-on. Then I went and saw Genevieve perform on a sunny day outdoors in Austin. That SXSW performance gave me a new glimpse of her talent, especially the many ways she could sing, all with great conviction. So I invited her to my desk and she came armed not with the band she had in Austin but simply with an accompanist, Chris Faller, and her voice. To anyone in that room — and for you watching this Tiny Desk — her promise is undeniable.

<item><title>![CDATA[DakhaBrakha: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert]]</title><description>![CDATA[People always ask me, "What's your favorite Tiny Desk Concert?" Well, right now it's the one recently performed by DakhaBrakha. The creative quartet from Kiev, Ukraine make music that sounds like nothing I've ever heard, with strands of everything I've ever heard. There are rhythms that sound West African and drone that feels as if it could have emanated from India or Australia. At times, DakhaBrakha is simply a rock band whose crazy homeland harmonies are filled with joy. All the while, they play tight-knit tunes featuring accordion, drums, reeds and shakers while wearing tall, Marge Simpson-looking wool hats that made me jealous.

I want the world to see this Tiny Desk Concert more than any other right now. It's refreshing to hear the power of acoustic music and the many worlds of sound still waiting to be explored. -- BOB BOILEN

<item><title>![CDATA[Death Cab For Cutie: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert]]</title><description>![CDATA[Death Cab For Cutie came as a trio: Ben Gibbard sang, Nick Harmer played bass, and we wheeled in our piano for Zac Rae. This intimate set included two new songs — including "Black Sun," the first single from their new album Kintsugi.

The album title refers to the Japanese art of reassembling broken pottery and making the breakage part of the newly formed pot. Death Cab For Cutie, a groundbreaking band formed in 1997, has gone through its own rebuilding of sorts. Chris Walla, a founding member of the band, has left, after contributing music to Kintsugi, but that's his farewell offering.

Death Cab For Cutie is still strongly defined by Gibbard's words, and that couldn't be more evident in this beautifully stark performance, which also includes "No Room In Frame" from Kintsugi, as well as two stripped-down favorites from the past. One, "Your Heart Is An Empty Room," is from Plans, while a beautiful love song from Transatlanticism, "Passenger Seat," moistened more than a few eyes in the crowd.

Set List
"Black Sun" 0:07
"No Room In Frame" 5:13
"Your Heart Is An Empty Room" 9:23
"Passenger Seat" 14:00

<item><title>![CDATA[Fantastic Negrito: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert]]</title><description>![CDATA[It says a lot that, with almost 7,000 entries to choose from, we selected Fantastic Negrito as the winner of our Tiny Desk Concert Contest. For his winning submission, he performed "Lost In A Crowd" in a freight elevator in Oakland. It was his passion, his voice and his backing band that landed him an invitation to perform behind my desk. We're proud of our choice.

As we learned after choosing him as our winner, Fantastic Negrito — a.k.a. Xavier Dphrepaulezz, pronounced dee-FREP-ah-lez — has a remarkable backstory. One of 15 children, he grew up in a strict home, and later signed a contract with Interscope Records in the '90s. That deal fell apart, though, and soured him on music-making. Then, a near-fatal car crash put him in a coma, and eventually left him without the proper use of his hands; he struggled with physical therapy for years to get some movement from what he now calls "The Claw."

These days, bolstered by a new outlook on life and music, he's reawakened and reemerged under the name Fantastic Negrito. You'll see that newly rediscovered purpose in his eyes and hear it in his voice, as he performs this Tiny Desk Concert with his fantastic band. -- BOB BOILEN

My own transcription of one of J.S. Bach's most infamous and popular works. I first had the idea of playing this piece in 2013 after hearing an old Russian transcription performed by the incredible Varvara Ivanova, but couldn't get hold of that version due to it being out of print. I loved the power this piece brings to the harp and was determined to try it for myself as I'm a huge fan of anything where I get to play LOUD! The process of adapting the piece for the harp and preparing for this performance took 18 months and many, many practice hours! Its first public performance was as the opening piece of my Masters final recital at the Royal Academy of Music, London in July 2014. Yes I know, how crazy was I to open my recital with this...I then had to play for a further 35 minutes!

All notes in this transcription are Bach's - there are a few moments where certain notes have been omitted where it was impossible to play, but nothing has been added or embellished in terms of pitches or rhythms. My aim in transcribing this was to be as accurate and respectful to the original as I possibly could, whilst also exploring the greater dynamic possibilities with regards to quiets, crescendos and diminuendos that are possible on the harp. I absolutely loved recreating the sound of different manuals/stops in certain repeated passages of the fugue - this is achieved by playing lower in the strings before returning back to the middle where I'd normally play.

Sumetckaya 

Who is riding? Who is riding? Look, who is riding?
These are our skobari riding on a lamemare.
 
Skobari are funny people,
They come home from the fair -
Some are unclothed,some are bare,
Some are head broken.


Do your best and
Play me funny "Skobar",
Oh make me feel good, so the belly doesn’t ache,
Oh have mercy on me, sinner.

Do your best and play so good,
So that legs are kicking,
And so that snotty punks
Wouldn’t jump around.
I want to prance,
I want to hoof it,
But frankly speaking,
I want to come to blows
Who is that lad,
Hopping and dancing,
He’d better watch out
For an aspen log.
 
I was going for a whoopee,
My daddy tossed me a nickel,
My mommy whispered:
“Don’t get wasted, you little fool!”.

I was born reckless,
I don’t cherish anything,
If my head is chopped off,
I will tie a log instead.

I am braking, I am bending.
I will say I’m feeling sick,
You’d bring me half-a-litter,
I need no doctors anymore.

If you tell us we are drunkards,
You can go and bite me,
We’ve been drinking on our own money,
We got no alms from anyone.

They’ve been beating me, 
Trying to punch me in the eye,
Instead they hit me in the shoulder, 
So I am standing laughing out loud.
 
I can’t be upset anymore, 
I can’t weep any longer,
Give me some time to be joyful and have fun.

My girlfriend has braids down to her waist,
We’ve been fighting with my friend for these very braids.  
 
You my friend, you proud eagle,
See what you’ve done to me,
You have brought me to the dark forest,
You have brought me to the prison.

We’ve been playing, 
We’ve been fighting,
Now we have to sit behind iron bars,
And see the freedom far away.

The prison of Petrograd,
The one with curvy stairs,
We’ve been locked up with my friend,
We’ve been singing songs with him.
 
Play, my friend, and I will be singing,
So that my belly wouldn’t ache,
Let the people judge us,
Let’s get merry behind bars.]]</description><pubDate>2015-01-21 00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JQ0xnJyb0A</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JQ0xnJyb0A</guid>
