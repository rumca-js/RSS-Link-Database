  <p id="8Hglf9"><em>Gran Turismo</em> creator Kazunori Yamauchi isn’t ruling out a PC port for the long-running racing sim franchise. In <a href="https://www.gtplanet.net/gran-turismo-on-pc-could-happen/">an interview with <em>GTPlanet</em></a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gran-turismo-7-ceo-says-the-team-is-looking-into-a-pc-port">via <em>Eurogamer</em></a>) during the <em>Gran Turismo </em>World Finals on Sunday, Yamauchi told the outlet that the Polyphony Digital development team is “looking into” bringing the series from PlayStation to PC.</p>
<p id="eIqtGq"><em>“Gran Turismo</em> is a very finely tuned title,” Yamauchi told <em>GTPlanet</em>, while also expressing some concern about getting the game to consistently run in 4K at 60 frames per second across all platforms. “It’s not a very easy subject, but of course, we are looking into it and considering it.”</p>

<p id="1IYMRV">The Libero’s design is pretty clever. It actually hangs <em>upside down </em>when hooked to the included partition hanger, and then flips right side up when set atop your desk. LG says it automatically adjusts its screen orientation when flipped, and it also comes with a detachable webcam (along with two webcam ports), so you can partake in video calls no matter how it’s mounted.</p>

  <p id="ETNP0b">As a radio host for Canada’s 91.5 The Beat, Kat Callaghan struggled to keep her role as TikTok’s new text-to-speech voice under wraps. When her voice appeared on the app last year, listeners started sending her countless TikToks pointing out the similarities. “Have you heard this? It kind of sounds like you,” she recalls listeners saying.</p>
<p id="UiPKut">But it wasn’t until last month that Callaghan confirmed what her listeners had long suspected: “Finally, I can tell you guys,” she said in a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@voiceofkat/video/7156223256549281030?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">TikTok video</a>, the first she’d ever posted. “It is me.” The video went viral almost immediately, amassing more than 45 million views since it went live.</p>
<p id="mgAylE">Callaghan’s voice, known as “Jessie” in the app, has become a popular way for creators to convey their thoughts...</p>

  <p id="bCQd2m">Friday afternoons growing up meant a trip to the video store. It was an utter thrill, like a little weekly Christmas, where my mom would turn my sister and me loose among the laminated, empty VHS boxes to pick out something to rent for the weekend. And as a rare treat, she would sometimes relent to our whining and let us take home the Holy Grail of rentals: a Sega console. A teenage Video Update<em> </em>employee would retrieve it for us and make sure that the controllers and cords were all accounted for in a massive, nuclear-code-style suitcase. </p>
<p id="sxBVCQ">That’s what carrying an entire game console looked like in 1993. Things are a little different now. A few weeks ago, I packed our game console to take it along on a family vacation. This time, it all...</p>
