<p>The academic’s look at truth, democracy and art has its heart very much in the right place. But too often it’s fighting old battles rather than grasping the modern reality of untruths</p><p>‘I came into the world to the soundtrack of history,” says Simon Schama as his new series begins, explaining that he was born on 13 February 1945, when Nazi rockets were falling on London and allied bombs were devastating Dresden. If that sounds like a Partridgean piece of self-aggrandisement, it’s forgivable: the three-part Simon Schama’s History of Now (BBC Two) is unabashedly a personal overview of the postwar era, and the art and literature that shaped it.</p><p>Episode one, subtitled Truth and Democracy, deals with what Schama sees as an era-defining battle between totalitarianism’s suppression of truth and artists’ unextinguishable yearning to tell it. An admiring glance at Picasso’s Guernica leads into an assessment of the disinformation battle running alongside the Spanish civil war, and how being on the wrong end of fascist lies inspired George Orwell to turn propaganda into dystopian fiction. Then, as the hot war of the 1930s and 40s turns cold, we’re in the Soviet Union in the late 50s, where Boris Pasternak knew the dissident sentiments within his epic novel Doctor Zhivago would lead to it being censored, but persevered and, following an exciting series of incidents involving smuggled manuscripts and CIA-backed publications abroad, won the Nobel prize.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/27/simon-schamas-history-of-now-review-this-highly-personal-show-is-simplistic-and-outdated">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It turned out Germany did have a No 9, after all. His name is Niclas Füllkrug, he is 29, less than a month into his international career, and when it mattered most there he was: coming on as a substitute to give his country hope of staying in the World Cup. With seven minutes to go in just his third game for the <em>Mannschaft</em>, he thumped a rising shot beyond Unai Simón to level the score here and offer them a lifeline, immediately running to the touchline and into the arms of Hansi Flick.</p><p>On a night when some of the jeopardy and drama had been taken from this game six hours earlier – Costa Rica’s surprise victory against Japan meaning Germany took a step back from the edge of the abyss – Füllkrug’s goal gives them something more solid to hold on to.

<p>Manchester United were already reportedly keen to buy winger before the World Cup, where he has already scored two goals</p><p>In a tent amid Doha’s university campus, the player to take lessons from was sitting to Cody Gakpo’s right. Daley Blind knows the value of a searing World Cup debut: he was 24 when the Netherlands beat Spain 5-1 in a modern classic eight years ago and the first of his two assists was for Robin van Persie’s extraordinary body-flipping header. “It was a great game, maybe that game changed my life,” Blind said. “We’ll see about that for everyone who is in the tournament.”</p><p>That outcome already seems nailed on for Gakpo. His teammate had been asked to make a comparison with the winger’s outstanding first week at Qatar 2022, which has brought two goals and directly earned a stuttering side four points. It is hardly a secret Gakpo is destined for higher echelons than those inhabited by PSV Eindhoven but football’s month-long showpiece remains the most significant validator to global eyes. He has blazed on to the scene and the Netherlands’ prospects may, to a large extent, depend on him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/27/versatile-cody-gakpo-in-life-changing-form-for-stuttering-netherlands">Continue reading...</a>

Rather, it hadn’t exactly gone well for her – awfully, actually – and by the time she was a 20-something comedian carving out a career in New York City, it was a period of her past she was desperate to forget.</p><p>To say she’d totally buried the memories, Wilson reckons, might be overly dramatic. “It’s more that I knew it was shitty, and that it impacted me,” the 26-year-old explains over Zoom from her Upper West Side apartment. At 15, she’d appeared on the TV talent show, was treated brutally, had her dreams crushed yet was dragged further into the competition’s gruelling rounds. It’s fair to say a path to pop stardom wasn’t forthcoming. “It was total humiliation,” she says, “so I tried to put it in a box and never go back to it.” If the topic came up in conversation, Wilson would shut it down – “Yeah, it was crazy;” “I know, right?” – giving stock answers to end it. “It was to the point that only eight months into therapy did I first mention it,” says Wilson. Unsurprisingly, her therapist believed it warranted a chat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/27/how-emily-wilson-turned-her-teenage-x-factor-humiliation-into-comedy-gold">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Georgian-German author’s account of the relationship between siblings who share a father swerves into geopolitical drama to jolting effect</p><p>The overseas success of Georgian-German novelist Nino Haratischvili’s 900-page epic <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/04/the-eighth-life-for-brilka-by-nino-haratischivili-review">The Eighth Life</a></em> (2019), which followed a single Georgian family through the tumult of the 20th century, has prompted the translation of this shorter, more intimate 2011 novel about an on-off sexual relationship between two adoptive siblings.<br /><br />Set largely in Hamburg, it’s narrated by 36-year-old Stella, a slipshod journalist at “a medium-sized, mediocre newspaper” whose editor promises to put her in charge of the culture section if she can focus. But work – not to mention her husband and six-year-old son – soon go by the wayside when her ex-lover, Ivo, a war reporter raised as her brother, arrives in town after eight years incommunicado.</p><p>Haratischvili’s scenario will appeal to fans of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/29/adele-leila-slimani-review">Leïla Slimani’s </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/29/adele-leila-slimani-review">Adèle</a></em>, which also involves a half-arsed hack whose clandestine sex life brings release from domestic and professional obligations. Stella’s appeal as a narrator rests on her chilly blasts of ennui. Here she is on her sister, a children’s author: “I found the staid conventionality she radiated almost intolerable.” And her husband, Mark, an award-winning documentary-maker? “I hated him for… his sympathetic manner, his strong sense of responsibility, his blamelessness.” When he serves wine in crystal glasses, she tells us damningly that he “always fetched these glasses with a view to us having special sex later on”.<br /><br />Stella mixes her frank account of the to-do stirred up by Ivo’s return – hotel-room assignations, missed school pick-ups, a him-or-me ultimatum from Mark – with the story of how she and Ivo grew up together after her philandering father slept with his mother. But as we yo-yo between time frames to see the fallout from their adolescent lust, Stella tiptoes teasingly around more deeply buried secrets, not least her part in the tragedy that first brought Ivo into her family.<br /><br />While the novel’s sexual voltage buoys you through its twists and turns, Haratischvili isn’t out only to portray middle-class marital and maternal strife. When Ivo urges Stella to join him on assignment to the Caucasus with an exiled musician he got to know in New York, the jolting gear shift into geopolitical drama crams practically another novel’s worth of characters into a quarter of the book’s length. For readers of <em>The Eighth Life</em>, it’s a return to expected turf, but it also feels like authorial bet-hedging about where the story’s strengths lie.</p><p><em>My Soul Twin</em> by Nino Haratischvili (translated by Charlotte Collins) is published by Scribe (£16.99).

<p>(Nettwerk)<br />Mieke mines a rich seam of nostalgia and loss – and her extensive travels – on a dreamlike second album</p><p>It’s often joked that hearing about other people’s dreams is boring. While the scattered poetics of <a href="https://annamieke.com/">Anna Mieke</a>’s lyrics are indeed dreamlike, the mesmeric artistry of her second album, <em><a href="https://annamieke.bandcamp.com/">Theatre</a></em>, means that Mieke’s images, her sense memories, start to feel like your own: from “trees evergreen blinking in the car lights” to “plastic flowers cast across the Tarmac”. In part, it’s the power of the words themselves (one imagines Mieke’s notebook crammed with scribbled gems). But it’s also the music: rippling Spanish guitar fingerpicking and swirling melodies; delicate piano notes and flickers of clarinet.</p><p>Born in Wicklow, Ireland, Mieke spent part of her childhood in New Zealand, later moving to Bulgaria, Bangladesh, Switzerland and Spain, and her songs teem with motifs from her travels. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-Z24vEMGwE">Go Away from My Window</a> is one highlight among many; a salty heartbreak ballad where her river-clear voice dips in and out of classical Indian phrasing. When memories are mined, there’s often a mixture of nostalgia and loss – we can never be fully back in the moment – and Mieke’s songs are coloured by this. “Nothing’s ever meant to stay the same,” she sings on Mannequin, a sigh rather than a lament. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/27/anna-mieke-theatre-review-the-irish-singer-songwriters-spellbinding-follow-up">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The prizewinning author’s timely, precise study traces our attempts to understand the units that have such an impact on our health</p><p>In spring 1858, the German scientist Rudolf Virchow published an unorthodox vision of the nature of living organisms. In his book, <em>Cellular Pathology</em>, he argued that the human body was simply “a cell state in which every cell is a citizen”. From a single originator, all other cells are derived, he argued, and when their function is disturbed, disease will often ensue.</p><p>The origins of Virchow’s arguments are intriguing. A reclusive, progressive, soft-spoken physician who had eschewed a career in the church because he thought his voice too weak for preaching, he championed the cause of public health and promoted free thinking. His views led to frequent clashes with German authorities. He became particularly incensed over their failures to tackle outbreaks of typhus and denounced them in print. For his pains, Virchow was forced to resign from his hospital post in Berlin.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/27/the-song-of-the-cell-by-siddhartha-mukherjee-review-mysteries-of-the-building-blocks-of-life">Continue reading...</a>

When Toni Crews died at 30 of a very rare cancer, her parents were determined to carry out her last request – and allow a documentary team unprecedented access. Here, they share why filming the dissection of their daughter’s body will benefit so many others<p>Nestled together on the sofa, in the front room of their home on the Kent coast, Jo and Jason Crews are scrolling through a stream of Facebook comments. The evening before we meet, they’d shared a heartfelt post on a private Facebook page – an update for their tightknit community of grieving family and friends – with the latest news of their late daughter Toni’s remarkable posthumous journey. Overwhelmed with emotion, Jo reads out a few of the responses: “Even though she’s no longer here, this is her legacy,” reads one. “She’s so brave, very giving right until the end,” says another. We’re all firmly in lump-in-throat territory from the get-go.</p><p>In July 2020, when she was just 30 years old, Toni died from a rare form of cancer. The eldest of three sisters, she was raised in the house where we are now sitting. In her final few months, it was here that Toni returned to. As parents, Jo and Jason’s loss is unimaginably vast; the love they feel for their daughter clear in every sentence uttered. And yet, somehow, while navigating this deep tragedy, they have also been tirelessly at work, making every effort – however hard it felt at times – to see through their daughter’s last wishes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/nov/27/her-dying-wish-why-toni-crews-chose-to-let-her-dead-body-be-filmed">Continue reading...</a>

## The Tories are tearing themselves apart over housing – but this is another crisis of their own making | John Harris

<p>Twelve years of decaying public services mean any sensible conversation about much-needed new housing is impossible</p><p>In the corner of Somerset where I have lived for nearly 15 years, life in late-Tory England grinds on.

<p>Alexandre Koberidze’s beguiling tale of love at first sight plays out against the backdrop of the 2018 Russian tournament</p><p>In what is possibly the most gloriously offbeat piece of World Cup counter-programming ever attempted, the utterly beguiling <em>What Do We See When We Look at the Sky?</em>, by Georgian director Alexandre Koberidze, arrives in UK cinemas. Set in the city of Kutaisi, against the backdrop of the previous World Cup, the film is a playfully meandering, rangy story that threads together teasing hints of magical realism, a tale of love at first sight, talking drainpipes and sentient surveillance cameras, and the football-watching preferences of the local stray dog population.</p><p>Central to the story are Lisa and Giorgi, a pharmacist and a footballer respectively, who meet by chance and arrange a date the following day. But an evil eye observes and curses them: both change appearance overnight. There’s a languid kind of magic to Koberidze’s approach, which, with its enchanting score, digressive montages and sparse dialogue, has roots in silent cinema but also feels refreshingly and genuinely original.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/27/what-do-we-see-when-we-look-at-the-sky-review-a-georgian-world-cup-winner-alexandre-koberidze">Continue reading...</a>

Even in an age of xG, hot takes and style entitlement, that’s still the most important thing. The result was another reminder that what age taketh away, experience giveth.</p><p>Another victory today against Morocco would put Belgium into the last 16 with a game to spare. Morocco played pretty well in their 0-0 draw with Croatia, but it was another World Cup game without a victory. Their last was against Scotland, which gives you an idea of long it’s been.

And he uses the full eye-popping scope of cinema to ensure that the film entirely escapes its theatrical origins. With its peppy colour palette and cartoonish quality, there’s a kinship with the appealingly stylised, hyperreal quality of the <em>Paddington</em> films in this version of <em>Matilda</em>, which follows a previous (1996) non-musical film version of the book, directed by Danny DeVito.</p><p>Production design aside, highlights include the very assured Alisha Weir in the title role and a game Emma Thompson sporting tombstone dentures and military fatigues as a monstrous version of Miss Trunchbull.

<p>Wine might be widely drunk, but there is still an idea, however old-fashioned, that it’s bourgeois to drink it</p><p>Mixed news last week for wine drinkers. Research by scientists at Rush Medical Center in Chicago<strong> </strong>claims that<strong> </strong>a glass of red with dinner could slash your risk of developing dementia. Just don’t start too young, say rival researchers at the Uniformed Services University in Maryland, who claim that children who are given even a sip of <em>l’eau rouge</em> – water reddened by wine – are more likely to end up with addiction problems.</p><p>Perhaps the answer, then, is for the children to drink natural wine, which might be at least good for their digestive system, according to another study. Or barolo, the preferred grape of “emotionally stable” drinkers, according to an investigation into links between wine preference and personality by researchers at Italian universities. Either way, if you are among the 60% who are now “sober curious” – intention, rather than action, being the operative here – the chances are you’ll be decanting your cellars into your moisturiser, as Brad Pitt does with his new wine-inspired skincare line, Le Domaine. So long as everyone avoids Buckfast wine. Sales are up in Scotland, leading some to (incorrectly) fear an increase in crime.

The new season olive oil is here and it’s at the heart of every supper<p>Dad used to criticise us children when we said we “loved” certain foods, as it sounded discordant to his Italian ears. Love was reserved for people. But it is with actual love that my father tends to some 100 Tuscan olive trees and makes the olive oil our whole family eats all year. He also delivers three special bottles of olive oil to our house for the kids with printed labels that say something like: “This bottle of olive oil is made for the sole enjoyment of my grandchild…” Elsa says it just clicks (her words) with everything. Even food she doesn’t like, such as broccoli. She’s not wrong.</p><p>My brother and his children have helped with this year’s harvest and rushed a few first bottles of the thick green oil to us. The typical tasting notes are cut-grass, raw artichokes and a hot peppery finish in the throat that can take your breath away.

She married Colin Tennant, later Lord Glenconner and the owner of Mustique, an island in the West Indies, in 1956. They had five children together, of whom three survive. Her son Charlie, a former heroin addict, died of hepatitis in 1996. Her son Henry died of Aids in 1990. She was appointed lady in waiting to Princess Margaret in 1971. Her first book, a memoir called <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/24/lady-in-waiting-anne-glenconner-review">Lady in Waiting</a></em>, was published in 2019 and became a surprise hit.

As football fever takes hold, one young fan is more interested in the cuddles than the goals<p>‘I want to watch football,’ my son announces as he arrives in from school. This is a surprise, to say the least. I love football, but lack the channels to watch many matches before his bedtime, so his experience of it in our house has been relatively meagre, and has provoked near perfect complacency within him in all that time. Now, he’s been turned on to the beautiful game by football-mad schoolfriends, who appear to be the kind of four-year olds who rank their weekend’s accumulators, and squabble over Gareth Southgate’s selections.</p><p>His interest is so low, in fact, that he’s previously had a hard time differentiating football from all other programming he dislikes, which he terms the ‘news’. The ‘news’ is anything that isn’t CBeebies, including <em>The Crown</em>, <em>Bargain Hunt</em> and any of the 8,000 Netflix series my wife watches featuring attractive teens with magic powers and inscrutably complex personal relationships.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/27/its-coming-home-the-beautiful-game-arrives-in-the-oreilly-household">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For our festival-averse film critic, movies about concerts and musicians are essential viewing – and he believes we are living through a golden age for the form</p><p>Reviewing <em>Summer of Soul</em> in the <em>Observer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review">New Review</a></em> last year, I suggested that it might be “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/18/summer-of-soul-review-questlove-documentary-harlem-cultural-festival-1969">the best concert film ever made</a>”. Since then, I’ve rewatched the movie umpteen times and come to the conclusion that it’s actually my favourite pop music documentary of all time. That should tell you two things about my obviously very personal list of great pop docs: first, that concert movies and rock docs are both part of the same generic continuum, interwoven and often inseparable; second, that although many of the most celebrated examples of the genre hail from the 60s and 70s, I believe we are living through a golden age of pop music docs.</p><p>A cursory glance at my list will reveal that several of my highest ranking entries are from the recent past. Yet in the case of films such as <em>Summer of Soul, Amazing Grace</em> and <em>The Beatles:</em> <em>Get Back</em><em>, </em>they are also archival works that revisit material originally generated for previous film and TV projects many decades ago. Just as Peter Jackson’s <em>The Beatles:</em> <em>Get Back</em> embraced the medium of long-form television to counterbalance the fraught air of the 1970 cinema release <em>Let </em><em>It Be</em>, so <em>Amazing Grace</em> used modern technology to rescue previously unsalvageable footage of Aretha Franklin that Sydney Pollack shot for an abandoned feature in the early 70s. As for <em>Summer of Soul</em>, it’s a perfect combination of cultural archaeology and forward-looking celebration.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/27/the-top-20-music-documentaries-chosen-by-mark-kermode-summer-of-soul-beatles-get-back-peter-jackson-bowie">Continue reading...</a>

Rishi Sunak is rehearsing reasons for voters to choose his party again with MPs wavering over standing at the next election<p>What will the Tories say to voters at the next election? They’ll be pitching for a historic fifth term, which is ambitious even in the best of times. That there have been three prime ministers in this term alone is one of the least dramatic points of this period. The current occupant of Number 10, Rishi Sunak, is trying to persuade his MPs to stick with him at least until that election, with many of the brightest and best <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/25/tory-mps-gary-streeter-and-dehenna-davison-wont-stand-at-next-election" title="">considering quitting</a> before they get shoved by their voters. In less than two years’ time, Sunak will be advancing an argument for why the electorate should stick with him, too. But what can he possibly say?</p><p>Once a party is in government its best election pitch is to say to voters that it’s safest to stay with the devil they know, rather than risking the opposition party. Party leaders tend to point to everything they’ve achieved, before asking voters for more time to finish the job. Sunak has two problems with this. He doesn’t have a lot to point to in the way of Conservative achievements from the past decade and a bit. It’s also not entirely clear what the job is that only the Tories can finish, given his focus on fixing a mess made far worse by his own party.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/27/what-is-the-tory-party-legacy-after-so-many-years-in-power-pretty-thin-gruel">Continue reading...</a>

The Scottish leader must take heed of changing views on the treatment of gender dysphoria<p>It would be lovely to live in a world where everyone had good intentions.

<p>The director of the Oscar-winning The Shape of Water has turned the timeless fable into a magical Mussolini-era parable</p><p>Death and fascism may not seem ideal subjects for a life-affirming fantasy animation for grownup children of all ages. Yet Mexican maestro Guillermo del Toro, whose 2017 masterpiece <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/18/the-shape-of-water-review-guillermo-del-toro-sally-hawkins">The Shape of Water</a></em> won the Oscar for best picture, brings his monstrous cinematic skills to bear on Carlo Collodi’s timeless fable with miraculous results, turning it into a Mussolini-era parable about a “lethal form of control and paternity”. Using the tactility of stop-motion animation to lend splintery weight (both physical and emotional) to the story, Del Toro and co-director Mark Gustafson, whose credits include <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/25/fantastic-mr-fox-review">Fantastic Mr Fox</a></em> (2009), conjure a tale of war and childhood that nods its wooden head towards Mary Shelley while thematically sitting alongside Del Toro’s Spanish-language masterpieces <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/aug/17/artsfeatures5">The Devil’s Backbone</a></em> (2001) and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/nov/26/sciencefictionandfantasy.thriller">Pan’s Labyrinth</a> </em>(2006).</p><p>Along with co-writer Patrick McHale (Matthew Robbins gets a “screen story” credit), Del Toro resituates Collodi’s source in the between-the-war years of the 20th century. Carpenter Geppetto (voiced by David Bradley) has lost his beloved son, Carlo, in the Great War. One night, drunk on grief, he cuts down the tree by Carlo’s grave and builds a ramshackle puppet (<a href="https://www.madcreator.com/">Gris Grimly</a>’s illustrations provide structural inspiration) to replace his lost child. When a blue spirit breathes life into the puppet, Geppetto is initially terrified of the whirling dervish unleashed in his home. But the pair soon settle down, with Pinocchio (Gregory Mann) helping Geppetto repair the huge crucified Christ that hangs like a tortured marionette in the church where congregants shriek about demonic puppets. “Everybody likes <em>him</em>,” says Pinocchio, pointing up at what looks like a prop from Ken Russell’s <em>The Devils </em>(1971)<em>. </em>“He’s made of wood too. Why do they like him and not <em>me</em>?”</p><p>In cinemas now and <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80218455">on Netflix from 9 December</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/27/guillermo-del-toros-pinocchio-review-a-superbly-strange-stop-motion-animation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Behind the outcry about waiting times lies the anxiety that our cherished GP system will, in the words of one Gloucester doctor, ‘soon reach a threshold where there is a collapse’. We witness life on the frontline</p><p>Last week, I went to Gloucester to see a doctor. I was armed with headlines that placed the city and its surrounding county at the sharpest end of the current crisis in general practice. More than <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/westcountry/2022-11-03/we-are-facing-the-perfect-storm-gp-on-rising-pressures-faced-by-nhs">30,000 patients</a> in Gloucestershire had to wait more than a month for a GP appointment in September, a figure that had doubled in a year. Meanwhile, since the pandemic, doctors and nurses and reception staff have been leaving jobs and partnerships in <a href="https://www.gponline.com/nhs-course-shortfall-11000-gps-within-decade/article/1791669">unprecedented numbers</a>. (There is a current shortfall of at least 4,200 GPs across England, with notable gaps in the south-west.)</p><p>Dr Bob Hodges, a veteran of the frontline of primary care, had invited me to his Gloucester practice to witness the more complicated reality behind those headlines. Hodges is a big, gentle man with an easy smile, one of nine partners at the Aspen medical practice near the centre of the city, and vice-chair of the local medical committee that represents the county’s GPs. He wears hospital scrubs because he doubles as a subspecialist in dermatology doing minor operations. He gets in early. “Either it’s paperwork before patients or vice versa,” he says, “and we have a late clinic until 8pm so usually I’m too knackered to do the admin after the last patient.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/27/stress-exhaustion-1000-patients-a-day-english-gp-nhs-collapse">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Magnum photographer’s image of a family in Sicily recalls Fellini and Visconti in its romantic depiction of everyday Italian life</p><p><a href="https://www.magnumphotos.com/newsroom/bruno-barbey-1941-2020/">Bruno Barbey</a> chanced upon this family defying gravity on their dad’s scooter in Palermo in 1963. The French-Moroccan photographer had been travelling in Italy for a couple of years by then, restless for exactly this kind of image, with its seductive mix of humour and authenticity. Has there ever been a better articulation of contrasting roles in the patriarchal family? Father sitting comfortably in his jacket and cap and smiling for the camera, while behind him his possibly pregnant wife sees trouble ahead, as she and their three kids and their big checked bag compete for precarious discomfort.</p><p>Barbey, then 22, had gone to Italy to try to find pictures that captured “a national spirit” as the country sought to rediscover the dolce vita in cities still recovering from war. He travelled in an old VW van and in Palermo in particular he located scenes that might have been choreographed for the working-class heroes of the Italian neorealist films, the self-absorbed dreamers of Fellini and Visconti (<em>The Leopard</em>, the latter’s Hollywood epic set in Sicily was released in the same year). Barbey’s camera with its wide angle lens picked up the detail of vigorous crowd scenes among street children and barflies and religious processions. His book, <em>The Italians</em>, now republished, is a time capsule of that already disappearing black-and-white world of priests and mafiosi and nightclub girls and nuns.</p><p><em><a href="https://delpireandco.com/en/produit/les-italiens/">Les Italiens</a></em><a href="https://delpireandco.com/en/produit/les-italiens/"> (French edition) by Bruno Barbey is republished by delpire &amp; co</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/nov/27/the-big-picture-cinematic-snapshot-of-a-disappearing-world-in-postwar-italy-bruno-barbey-magnum">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Beatles biographer evokes the energy and glamour of the 1960s in this droll and vivid account of his years on the Sunday Times Magazine</p><p>The old line that if you remember the 60s you really weren’t there is given a proper pasting by this clear-sighted and intricately detailed memoir. It crash lands right into the middle of that fabled decade and makes sure we’ll never forget it either. Philip Norman (born 1943), biographer of the Beatles, has the journalist’s vital gift of recall – faces, places, tones of voice – but also the funny bones of a satirist. <em>We Danced </em><em>on Our Desks</em> might be the drollest account of life on a 1960s newspaper since Michael Frayn’s <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/towards-the-end-of-the-morning-9780571315871">Towards </a></em><em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/towards-the-end-of-the-morning-9780571315871">the End of the Morning</a></em>.</p><p>What the book straightaway makes clear is how slow, for most, the 60s were to catch fire. The glum 50s had made very poor kindling. The teenage Norman worked shifts at Ryde pier pavilion on the Isle of Wight, where his ex-RAF father was manager and an alcoholic bankrupt. His mother had abandoned ship long before. Such were the straits that Norman couldn’t afford a badge for his school blazer, while home was the upstairs of a derelict pub he shared with a grandmother who sold rock (16 tons per summer) on the esplanade. It’s a childhood comprising Dickens and Patrick Hamilton, but the bright boy survived to leave school with A-levels and the prospect of a job on the <em>Hunt</em><em>s Post</em>, wangled for him by his mother.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/27/we-danced-on-our-desks-by-philip-norman-review-an-unbeatable-portrait-of-a-writer-finding-his-voice">Continue reading...</a>

Whether it’s a crunchy chardonnay from Australia or the 70s trend for ‘nouveau’, it seems that what’s in and what’s out in wine is a cyclical as the high street<p><strong>Domaine Bel Avenir Beaujolais Nouveau, Beaujolais, France 2022 (£13.33, or £12 as part of a mixed case of 6 bottles, <a href="https://wickhamwine.co.uk/">wickhamwine.co.uk)</a> </strong>Trends in wine are as cyclical as any other product, although a single spin of the wine world’s wheel of fashion does seem to take rather longer than the Mark Cavendish-at-full-pelt split-second it takes for clothes and music to move from new to beyond the pale to sophisticated retro. It took a while, for example, for wine’s trend setters to get around to rescuing the reputation of the exuberantly fruity, fresh-off-the-press 1970s and 1980s favourite “nouveau” wines of Beaujolais. But thanks in large part to the natural wine scene – which has championed the gluggable drinkability (or glou-glou as the French have it) of wines made using the same carbonic maceration winemaking technique that gave (and gives) Beaujolais nouveau its easy fruitiness – nouveau has become trendy again over the past decade. And Domaine Bel Avenir’s contribution from this year’s harvest brings a bright burst of berry to remind us sceptics why it was so popular in the first place.</p><p><strong>Errazuriz Estate Reserva Merlot, Curicó Valley, Chile 2021 (£9.99, or £8.99 as part of a mixed case of six bottles, <a href="https://www.majestic.co.uk/">majestic.co.uk</a>) </strong>Grape varieties are particularly susceptible to swings in fashion. Chardonnay is the obvious example: an enormous hit when the first buttery, tropically fruited Australian and California versions appeared in the 1980s, it was subject to a ferocious critical backlash in the 1990s and 2000s, despite being responsible for some of the greatest white wines (white burgundy, champagne) in the world. The red equivalent may well be merlot, which for a time in the 1990s and early noughties was the go-to soft and fruity red, but never really recovered from the reputational savaging it received (or was perceived to receive) in the 2004 wine-themed movie, Sideways. All of which seems a bit daft when you taste a suavely plump and plummy example such as Errazuriz’s, which shares many of the qualities of wines made from the grape variety that has replaced merlot in many drinkers’ repertoires, malbec, but with rather more depth and satisfyingly grainy texture than you usually find at this sort of price.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/nov/27/remember-merlot-why-grapes-varieties-in-and-out-of-fashion">Continue reading...</a>

New analysis reveals the least affluent need urgent government support this winter<p>This year will go down as a year of hardship for so many people: 2022 brought spiking energy bills and record levels of inflation that have eroded people’s incomes. But as former prime minister Gordon Brown warns in today’s <em>Observer</em>, next year will be harder still and hardest for low-income households, including less affluent pensioners, low-paid parents and their children and people with disabilities.</p><p>This is the result of Britain’s recession, forecast by the Bank of England to last <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/03/bank-england-warn-uk-economy-longest-recession-100-year-raise-rate-three-percent" title="">two years,</a> and energy bills that are forecast to continue to rise as government support with energy costs falls. From next April, the government’s energy price guarantee will become less generous, <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/energy-price-cap" title="">capping the average bill at £3,000</a> rather than £2,500 a year and the universal £400 worth of support that was paid to all households in winter 2022 will be withdrawn. To offset this reduction, the government has increased the level of targeted support at those in receipt of means-tested benefits: all pensioners and those receiving disability benefits will get <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/up-to-600-for-pensioners-arrive-in-bank-accounts-from-today" title="">£300</a> and £150, as they did last year, and people on means-tested benefits will get a one-off payment of <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2022/11/Help-today-squeeze-tomorrow.pdf" title="">£900</a>, up from £650 last year. So there is less support to go round, but it is more targeted on low-income households.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/27/observer-view-fuel-poverty-lowest-paid-freezing-government-support">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fears for safety of Ukraine’s nuclear plants amid repeated attacks; Kyiv launches ‘grain from Ukraine’ scheme; Belarus foreign minister dies</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>There are growing fears Russia’s relentless targeting of Ukraine’s electricity grid will threaten the safety of the country’s nuclear power plants</strong>, in the wake of the unprecedented emergency shutdown on Wednesday. Petro Kotin, the president of Ukraine’s nuclear power company, Energoatom, said all safety mechanisms had worked as intended on Wednesday but two generators were damaged in the process.</p><p>Ukrainian authorities are gradually restoring power, aided by the reconnection of the country’s four nuclear plants, but <strong>millions of people are still without heat or electricity</strong> after the most devastating Russian air strikes of the war.</p><p><strong>Russia kept up its onslaught on Ukrainian cities</strong> on Saturday with an attack on Dnipro which injured six people and destroyed seven houses, said the regional governor, Valentyn Reznichenko.</p><p><strong>Thirty-two civilians have been killed in Kherson since 9 November</strong>, when Russian forces withdrew from the southern city they had occupied for eight months, the Kyiv Independent quoted Ukraine’s national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, as saying.
