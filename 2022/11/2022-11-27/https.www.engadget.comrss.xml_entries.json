Workman Publishing \u00a9 2022</p><hr /><h2>How Sex Is Repressed Online</h2><p>Human and algorithmic censorship has completely changed the power structure of who gets to post what types of adult content online. This has played out as independent sex workers struggling to avoid getting kicked off of sites like Instagram or Twitter just for existing as people\u2014while big companies like Brazzers, displaying full nudity, have no problem keeping their accounts up.</p><p>Despite Facebook\u2019s origins as Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Hot-or-Not rating system for women on his Harvard campus, the social network\u2019s policies on sexuality and nudity are incredibly strict. Over the years, it\u2019s gone through several evolutions and overhauls, but in 2022 forbidden content includes (but isn\u2019t limited to) \u201creal nude adults,\u201d \u201csexual intercourse\u201d and a wide range of things that could imply intercourse \u201ceven when the contact is not directly visible,\u201d or \u201cpresence of by-products of sexual activity.\u201d Nudity in art is supposedly allowed, but artists and illustrators still fight against bans and rejected posts all the time.</p><p>That\u2019s not to mention \u201csexual solicitation,\u201d which Facebook will not tolerate. That includes any and all porn, discussions of states of sexual arousal, and anything that both asks or offers sex \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d and also includes sexual emojis like peaches and eggplants, sexual slang, and depictions or poses of sexual activity.</p><p>These rules also apply on Instagram, the photo-sharing app owned by Facebook. As the number one and two biggest social networks in the US, these dictate how much of the internet sees and interacts with sexual content.</p><p>In the earliest archived versions of Facebook\u2019s terms of use, sex was never mentioned\u2014but its member conduct guidelines did ban \u201cany content that we deem to be harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, vulgar, obscene, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable.\u201d This vagueness gives Facebook legal wiggle room to ban whatever it wants.</p><p>The platform took a more welcoming approach to sexual speech as recently as 2007, with Sexuality listed as one of the areas of interest users could choose from, and more than five hundred user-created groups for various discussions around the topic. But the platform\u2019s early liberality with sex drew scrutiny. In 2007, then\u2013New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo led a sting operation on Facebook where an investigator posed as teens and caught child predators.</p><p>As early as 2008, it started banning female breasts\u2014specifically, nipples. The areola violated its policy on \u201cobscene, pornographic or sexually explicit\u201d material. In December 2008, a handful of women gathered outside the company\u2019s Palo Alto office to breastfeed in front of the building in protest (it was a Saturday; no executives were working).</p><p>As of 2018, Facebook lumped sex work under banned content that depicts \u201csexual exploitation,\u201d stating that all references and depictions of \u201csexual services\u201d were forbidden, \u201cinclud[ing] prostitution, escort services, sexual massages, and filmed sexual activity.\u201d</p><p>A lot of this banned content is health and wellness education.</p><p>In 2018, sexuality educator Dr. Timaree Schmit logged in to Facebook and checked her page for SEXx Interactive, which runs an annual sex ed conference she\u2019d held the day before. A notification from Facebook appeared: She and several other admins for the page were banned from the entire platform for thirty days, and the page was taken down, because an \u201coffending image\u201d had violated the platform\u2019s community standards. The image in question was the word SEXx in block letters on a red background.</p><p>The examples of this sort of thing are endless and not limited to Facebook. Google AdWords banned \u201cgraphic sexual acts with intent to arouse including sex acts such as masturbation\u201d in 2014. Android keyboards\u2019 predictive text banned anything remotely sexual, including the words \u201cpanty,\u201d \u201cbraless,\u201d \u201cTampax,\u201d \u201clactation,\u201d \u201cpreggers, \u201cuterus,\u201d and \u201cSTI\u201d from its autocomplete dictionary. Chromecast and Google Play forbid porn. You can\u2019t navigate to adult sites using Starbucks Wi-Fi. For a while in 2018, Google Drive seemed to be blocking users from downloading documents and files that contained adult content. The crowdfunding site Patreon forbids porn depicting real people, and in 2018 blamed its payment processor, Stripe, for not being sex-friendly. Much of this followed FOSTA/SESTA.</p><p>This is far from a complete list. There are countless stories like this, where sex educators, sex workers, artists, and journalists are censored or pushed off platforms completely for crossing these imaginary lines that are constantly moving.</p><p>Over the years, as these policies have evolved, they\u2019ve been applied inconsistently and often with vague reasoning for the users themselves. There is one way platforms have been consistent, however: Images and content of Black and Indigenous women, as well as queer and trans people, sex workers, and fat women, experience the brunt of platform discrimination. This can lead to serious self-esteem issues, isolation, and in some cases, suicidal thoughts for people who are pushed off platforms or labeled \u201csexually explicit\u201d because of their body shape or skin color.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just sick of feeling like something is wrong with my body. That it\u2019s not OK to look how I do,\u201d Anna Konstantopoulos, a fat Instagram influencer, said after her account was shut down and posts were deleted multiple times. Her photos in bikinis or lingerie were deleted by Instagram moderators, while other influencers\u2019 posts stayed up and raked in the likes. \u201cIt starts to make you feel like crap about yourself.\u201d</p><p>In spite of all of this, people project their full selves, or at least a version of themselves, onto Facebook accounts. Censorship of our sexual sides doesn\u2019t stop people from living and working on the internet\u2014unless that is your life and work.</p>", "persistent": false}]
