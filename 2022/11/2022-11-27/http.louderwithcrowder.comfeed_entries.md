And while not specified on the website, I'm guessing it's "or else."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">IRS has stated that Americans must report payments on Venmo, PayPal over $600, per MarketWatch.<br />â€” unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) <a href="https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1596584754304126976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The government agency is targeting transactions that involve "part-time work, side gigs, and selling goods." Basically, the gig economy. If you work on your own without the government taking taxes right out of your check, or without a union taking donations to the Democrat Party right out of your wages, the IRS is very interested in your earnings.</p><p>By now you're saying to yourself, <em>"But Brodigan, I'm not a millionaire or a billionaire. I was told that Biden looking to increase taxes on the middle class was misinformation. What the deuce?"</em></p><p>Two things. One, LOL... you said "butt Brodigan." B, I'm not a journalist or an expert. I'm not qualified to tell you what is or isn't misinformation. However, there are some things I find interesting you might find of interest yourself.</p><p>- Democrats snuck lowering the threshold to $600 in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. Critics called the bill "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dan-crenshaw-stimulus-bribe" target="_blank">bribing us with our own money.</a>" If you opposed this part of the Biden agenda, you were told you didn't want to help taxpayers by sending them stimulus checks.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>- Funding for 87,000 new IRS employees was snuck into the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/irs-going-for-middle-class" target="_blank">Inflation Reduction Act</a>. If you opposed this part of the Democrat agenda you were told you didn't want to reduce inflation.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>- PayPal, which is willing to work with the Administration, tried sneaking in a penalty that <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/paypal-terms-changed" target="_blank">they will take up to $2500 out of your account over what they call "misinformation."</a> Whether what they call "misinformation" is the same as what the Administration defines as "misinformation" is unclear. But I know that you know that I know that you know.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

Few people have become such a disappointment to those of us who discovered girls and puberty in the 80s. Milano has become the literal worst. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rose-mcgowan-alyssa-milanos-metoo-hypocrisy" target="_blank">Even her liberal actress co-stars call her out</a>. Now she is signaling her virtue at Elon Musk. The former actress isn't leaving Twitter. She would cease to exist if she did. But she's giving back her Tesla.</p><p>Funny, because she once signaled her virtue about Tesla AND Elon Musk.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Dear <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@elonmusk</a>, My @TeslaMotors model x just arrived.

Since then Elon Musk has bought Twitter and said free speech is cool. 99% of the time, issue by issue, I'd bet money Elon still agrees with Milano politically. But he doesn't agree 100%. "Hatred" and "white supremacy" are the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/legal-influencer-tiktok" target="_blank">talking points distributed</a> by the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-free-beacon" target="_blank">shadowy progressive dark money groups</a>. Milano recited her lines and says she is scrapping her Tesla and taking a stand against hatred and white supremacy... by buying a Volkwagon.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>By now you can guess where this is going...</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I gave back my Tesla.<br /><br />I bought the VW ev.<br /><br />I love it.<br /><br />Iâ€™m not sure how advertisers can buy space on Twitter.

</p>
<p>Alyssa Milano claims Elon Musk supports hatred and white supremacy in buying Twitter. She sells her Tesla, the other company Musk owns. Milano than used the money to buy a Volkswagon, a company that ACKSHUALLY WAS founded on hatred and white supremacy.</p><p>Isn't it ironic? Elon thinks...</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">ðŸ¤£ðŸ’¯<br />â€” Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1596597968634642433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>This brings us to our exit question:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">POLL: Alyssa Milanoâ€™s best performanceâ€¦<br />â€” Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1596852438694494208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Some days you signal your virtue.
