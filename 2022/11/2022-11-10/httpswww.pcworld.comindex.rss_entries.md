<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>This year has been a good one for SSD sales&mdash;and it looks like Black Friday deals are only going to get better. Some prices on this type of storage drives have already fallen to tantalizing lows, and we&rsquo;re still a couple of weeks out from the main event.</p>



<p>Still, not every SSD deal you&rsquo;ll see is a true bargain. It pays to be armed with knowledge, whether that&rsquo;s tips on how to shop or just a list of the best deals. You&rsquo;ll find both below. Not sure if you should buy now or wait? Read up on our advice on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402867/should-you-wait-for-black-friday-to-upgrade-your-pc.html">when to buy your PC parts</a> during this November discount frenzy.</p>



<h2 id="best-early-black-friday-deals-on-ssds">Best early Black Friday deals on SSDs</h2>



<p>You can already snag a few eye-popping bargains in early November, especially if you happen to live near a Micro Center. Getting a 2TB PCIe 3.0 for just $80 is a screaming deal, and one that&rsquo;s been going fast. Just a handful of locations have stock available.</p>



<p>But there are other great discounts available online. You can pick up a 2TB SATA SSD&mdash;great as a more budget but still plenty-fast boot drive&mdash;for just $100. On the opposite end of the capacity spectrum, a 256GB SSD can be had for a mere $17. It&rsquo;s a perfect deal for upgrading old PCs (especially if you&rsquo;re turning <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393375/how-to-turn-a-laptop-into-a-chromebook.html">laptops into Chromebooks</a>, which require very little storage).</p>



<p>One note on the Crucial P2: It&rsquo;s on the slower side for a PCIe Gen 3, but should work well as a secondary drive for photos, game files, etc. It&rsquo;ll run faster than a 1TB SATA SSD at about the same sale price.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Black Friday will fall on November 25th, 2022. But like in years past, the deals have already begun ahead of that date&mdash;you can find discounts and bargains now.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>The best Black Friday deals drop prices on SSDs from reliable brands. A good discount starts around 15 to 20 percent&mdash;and a great deal will be 30 percent or more. Typically, the bigger bargains are higher capacity SSDs (2TB or higher).</p>



<p>For the specific brands to watch, stick with known names like Samsung, Crucial, SK Hynix, Western Digital, Kingston, and Sabrent. TeamGroup and PNY are also options. The further afield you go, the more likely you&rsquo;ll end up with underperforming (aka slow) drives.</p>



<p>Pay attention to the model, as well. You can often find multiple drives from a single vendor on sale. The usual sweet spots are discounts on high-performing drives rarely on sale and steep price cuts on budget models. This year we should finally see sizable reductions on high-capacity drives (2TB and up), too.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>So far, the best deals have been on 2TB drives (both NVME and SATA varieties), but there are already great deals on other common capacities (1TB, 500GB, 256GB) as well. So far, manufacturers with less brand-name recognition are going first with their mega-deals (Inland, Teamgroup, XPG), but we expect to see discounts for the bigger brands in the coming weeks. You won&rsquo;t miss out by not waiting, though.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>When looking to buy a smartwatch there are a few things you should consider. First and foremost, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure that the smartwatch is compatible with your smartphone&rsquo;s OS. Buying an Apple Watch only to figure out that it won&rsquo;t work with your Android phone is a bummer to say the least. </p>



<p>Next you should decide what features you want in your smartwatch. Are you a fitness buff? Then choosing a smartwatch with fitness tracking features such as workout tracking, heart rate monitoring, and GPS are great things to have. FitBit and Garmin are the leaders here.</p>



<p>Or are you looking for a smartwatch with a vast library of apps to use? If so, your best bet is to go with an Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy model, as they currently have the largest app rosters available. One other feature you&rsquo;ll want to take into consideration is personalization options. Things such as swappable watch bands and color options can be important if you want different styles for your smartwatch.</p>

## Black Friday graphics card deals: What to expect and early sales

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Black Friday is usually a great time to pick up hardware deals, but it&rsquo;s been a rough couple of years for bargain hunters. Chip shortages, the cryptocurrency boom, and worldwide supply chain issues have made the last two Black Fridays especially bleak for graphics card shoppers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But with these factors more or less behind us, and with new cards from all three major GPU manufacturers motivating retailers to discount older cards, it&rsquo;s finally time to look for some deals. So, if you&rsquo;re hoping to find a high-power RTX 30 series from Nvidia or Radeon 6000 series from AMD, or maybe a cheaper option from newcomer Intel, it might finally be time to pull the trigger.</p>



<p>Because retailers are trying to clear out stock to make room for next-gen cards, almost all of these deals come with free codes for new PC games. Some also have &ldquo;click here to clip coupon&rdquo; offers for even deeper discounts. So, even those marked at retail prices have a little something to sweeten the deal. </p>

<p>Black Friday 2022 is on Nov 25. But if you&rsquo;re looking to score a deal, there&rsquo;s no need to wait, as the GPU sales have already begun.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s kind of a big question. The answer is generally &ldquo;whichever one you want and can afford.&rdquo; But there are a lot of factors that go into which card is actually practical for you, not the least of which is whether your PC can physically hold or power up the GPU you choose. Make sure to read PCWorld&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">rankings of the best graphics cards of 2022</a> to make informed decisions.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="should-i-buy-nvidia-amd-or-intel">Should I buy Nvidia, AMD, or Intel?&nbsp;</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>All modern desktop graphics cards connect via the PCI-Express slot on your desktop computer&rsquo;s motherboard. As long as you have one slot free (and the required number of slots open to plug it into your computer case), it&rsquo;ll work. The difference between Nvidia and AMD is pretty slim at most price points. Unless you&rsquo;re interested in a particular feature of one brand, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393414/nvidia-rtx-retrospective-what-two-years-of-ray-tracing-and-dlss-got-us.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX effects</a> or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394725/amd-radeon-fidelityfx-super-resolution-games-gpus-launch.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AMD&rsquo;s FidelityFX SuperResolution</a>, either will do fine. </p>



<p>Intel&rsquo;s brand new Arc cards are a different proposition. The company is competing aggressively on price, making these cards a bargain, at least for newer games. But <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/search?q=arc+review#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=arc%20review&amp;gsc.page=1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Intel&rsquo;s drivers are still immature</a> compared to AMD and Nvidia, especially if you&rsquo;re playing older titles.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="is-my-desktop-compatible-with-a-new-graphics-card">Is my desktop compatible with a new graphics card?&nbsp;</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>It&rsquo;s time to break out the tape measure. Almost all modern desktops can fit at least some kind of external graphics card, as long as they have at least one PCIe slot on the motherboard. But before buying a new card, make sure your case can fit it, both in length (measured in millimeters) and in slots (the number of eternal notches at the rear of the case, not physical PCIe connections) it needs.&nbsp;Most mid-range cards use two slots, but <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1072925/custom-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-4080s-graphics-cards-insane.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">more powerful ones can use three or even four</a>.</p>



<p>You also need to make sure that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/539143/how-to-pick-the-best-power-supply-for-gaming.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">your computer&rsquo;s power supply can handle the additional watts</a> drawn by the new GPU, and that it has the correct power connections to supply electricity to it. If not, you can always upgrade your power supply, too.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="how-much-should-i-spend-on-a-new-gpu">How much should I spend on a new GPU?&nbsp;</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Generally speaking, the more you spend on a graphics card, the more powerful it will be&mdash;the better the effects and the more frames you can push in AAA games. A $1,000 card isn&rsquo;t necessarily twice as good as a $500 card, but it&rsquo;ll definitely be a lot better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there&rsquo;s such a thing as too much. If your computer is six or seven years old, the &ldquo;bottleneck&rdquo; of performance might be your processor or RAM, so spending four digits on a new card wouldn&rsquo;t be wise.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<h3 id="should-i-upgrade-the-rest-of-my-computer-too">Should I upgrade the rest of my computer too?&nbsp;</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>It depends. If you&rsquo;re upgrading to a really powerful graphics card, you definitely want to make sure that your power supply can handle it. If you haven&rsquo;t upgraded any of the major components in a while, it might be time for a system overhaul, too. That usually means <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/search?q=am4+upgrade#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=am4%20upgrade&amp;gsc.page=1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a new processor, motherboard, and sometimes RAM</a>, though AMD AM4 motherboards can slot in relatively new CPUs without needing any other new components.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure you want to drop that much on new hardware, you can always upgrade the GPU, do some testing in your favorite games, and see if you have the performance increase you want. If not, you can upgrade the other components as needed.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Black Friday 2022 will fall on Friday, November 25th. However, many retailers have already started to offer great discounts on dash cams.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>When purchasing a dash cam, you will want to focus on a few important features such as video capabilities, recording options, and other handy nice-to-haves. Video capabilities will be the most important aspect of your decision. You&rsquo;ll want to consider whether you need front and rearview or just front view. Also, check the resolution&mdash;we recommend at least 1080p, but premium 4K resolution dash cams really make a difference if you can swing the extra cost. </p>



<p>Additionally, you will want to take a look at the field of view. The sweet spot is between 120 to 140 degrees field of view, as anything less might miss important things and anything more may cause a fish-eye distortion to the recordings.</p>



<p>Next, you will want to decide on the recording options you need. Continuous loop recording automatically overwrites older recordings at specified intervals (unless saved) in order to minimize storage requirements. There is also incident recording, which uses motion detection and triggered impact detection to record possible accidents. </p>



<p>As for storage options, you will generally find that there are two options to choose from: cloud storage and microSD card storage. Cloud storage isn&rsquo;t as common, but it can be nice to have if you&rsquo;re worried about losing a physical memory card. Otherwise, a microSD card will be the most common option.</p>



<p>Finally, you should consider any other handy features that a particular dash cam might provide. These include GPS navigation, phone connectivity, parking monitoring, night vision, and speed detection. All of these will depend on your personal preference, but should be taken into account before purchase.</p>

<p>In the United States, insurance companies generally don&rsquo;t offer discounts for customers with dash cams installed. That said, the cameras do have their upsides: If you get into an accident, the video evidence can be used to prove you weren&rsquo;t at fault. To this extent, dash cams can be useful for capturing evidence of car theft, vandalism and of course run-of-the-mill accidents.</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Consumers shopping for Black Friday bargains on computers should consider Chromebooks a capable alternative. Interested? We&rsquo;ve curated the best deals on Chromebooks from major retailers, focusing only on machines that offer respectable hardware at legitimate discounts.</p>



<p>Chromebook sales have plunged in the days since students snapped them up during the pandemic. That means Chromebook makers are relatively desperate to unload inventory, and suddenly, <em>good</em> Chromebooks are on sale. That was the case during Amazon&rsquo;s Prime Early Access Sale in October, and you can expect more of the same in the days leading up to Black Friday.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Early Black Friday sales have already begun at several retailers. The &ldquo;Black Friday&rdquo; deals season is like Halloween or Christmas, meaning that actually lasts several weeks.</p>

<p id="block-655858d2-a221-44fc-936b-0e71165b3393">We still expect low-end Chromebooks&mdash;say, those with a 768p screen, Intel Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM and 16GB of SSD storage&mdash;to be priced about $100. And if they get much below $100, they become essentially a stocking stuffer for most people.</p>



<p id="block-63e8ba4c-46f5-4356-9687-b1f0fe8ae426">That said, look for these specs in a <em>respectable </em>Chromebook: an Intel Celeron N4000 chip or higher, 8GB of RAM, and a 1080p screen. A Pentium Silver N6000 processor is a step up from that. A Core m3-8100Y <em>isn&rsquo;t</em>, but may still be satisfactory.</p>



<p id="block-b1c0e16d-beb1-4fc4-a291-a8787aca009b">More memory (that is, 8GB rather 4GB of RAM) will allow for more browser tabs and a smoother browser experience. A 1080p screen will offer a comfortable laptop-like viewing experience. Onboard storage really doesn&rsquo;t matter all that much, though at least 32GB is preferable storing for apps, screenshots, and the like.</p>



<p id="block-b0e95528-e4be-46a2-a464-c119b38776e0">If you&rsquo;re familiar with our lengthy <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402141/chromebooks-versus-windows-laptops-which-should-you-buy.html">laptops versus Chromebooks explainer</a>, you know that one of the potential gotchas is buying a Chromebook whose <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6220366?hl=en&amp;xcust=2-1-1377179-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">support window</a> expires soon.

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>The iPad is the 800-pound gorilla of the tablet market, and Apple knows it. It remains one of the best-selling pieces of consumer electronics ever, so trying to find discounts on the latest and greatest models is an exercise in patience. But if you&rsquo;re likely to find any deals, it&rsquo;s on Black Friday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, the iPad comes in six different models. From smallest to largest: the iPad Mini (6th gen, 8.3 inches), the iPad (9th gen, 10.2 inches and the last with the Home Button design), the newer iPad (10th gen, 10.9 inches), the iPad Air (5th gen, 10.9 inches), the smaller iPad Pro (5th gen, 11 inches), and the larger iPad Pro (4th gen, 12.9 inches). All come with Wi-Fi standard, and can be upgraded with extra storage and a cellular connection, and are offered in at least two color choices.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Is your iPad broken, or does it feel slow and sluggish? Then yeah, you should probably buy a new one. If not, feel free to wait a year or two. Apple&rsquo;s software support for its tablets is second to none, and you&rsquo;re probably not going to miss out on anything huge with an older model so long as it&rsquo;s still working fine.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>That&rsquo;s a matter of taste. The iPad Mini is a wonderfully portable little tablet, but at 8.2 inches, it&rsquo;s not much bigger than the biggest smartphones out there. The largest iPad Pro is huge&mdash;big enough to replace a laptop if you add a keyboard, but that also makes it a lot less portable. The 10-to-11-inch range seems to be the sweet spot for most users. If you&rsquo;re unsure, head to your nearest electronics store&mdash;it almost certainly has most of the models on display.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="do-i-need-an-ipad-pro">Do I need an iPad Pro?&nbsp;</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>For most people, the answer is &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The iPad Pro is a lot more expensive than the Air or the standard iPad, and that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s using a much more powerful processor, plus extra features like Face ID and Thunderbolt connections. It also has access to more powerful multitasking. But all of this isn&rsquo;t really helpful if you mostly use an iPad as a reading or watching device. Unless you&rsquo;re trying to replace a full laptop with an iPad, keep that extra money for a nice case or bag.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="how-much-storage-does-my-ipad-need">How much storage does my iPad need?&nbsp;</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>That really depends on what you do with it. If you&rsquo;re mostly surfing the web, answering emails, and watching streaming video, then the basic 64GB-128GB of storage should be more than enough for you. But if you&rsquo;re constantly downloading high-end games or saving HD video to your tablet, you&rsquo;ll want some more.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Do you want to take your tablet on trips and leave your phone at home? Then, yes, you could probably use the cellular upgrade (LTE on the 9th-gen iPad, 5G on everything else). If not, then no, you don&rsquo;t need it&mdash;you can use tethering on your smartphone or local Wi-Fi pretty much all of the time. Also, be aware that cellular iPads need a separate data plan (and a monthly charge) in order to work off of Wi-Fi.&nbsp;</p>

(Especially if you&rsquo;re signing digital paperwork frequently.) Keyboards are more situational, and really only useful in the same situation as a full laptop.

<p>The Lenovo Legion 5 Pro tics off a lot of boxes. It offers fantastic gaming performance, a wide range of connectivity options, a rugged design, and so much more. The pricing is competitive, too. This machine is more than capable and the best bang for your buck.</p>

<p>The Legion 5 Pro has an Intel Core i7-12700H CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of SSD storage. According to our tester, the laptop &ldquo;screamed at 148 frames-per-second&rdquo; during the <em>Rise of the Tomb Raider</em> benchmark. The non-touch IPS display has a resolution of 2560&times;1600 and a maximum refresh rate of 165Hz. The display is also bright, but it&rsquo;s not as colorful as others we&rsquo;ve seen. Overall, we feel the pros far outweigh the cons here.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for strong gaming performance at an affordable price, the Asus VivoBook Pro 15 OLED is a fantastic choice. According to our tester, this laptop can easily handle &ldquo;gaming, streaming, and day-to-day productivity.&rdquo; It has an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of NVMe PCIe SSD storage. You may need to drop down to medium or high graphics when playing newer AAA titles. That said, this machine should be able to run older games just fine. The OLED panel is also superb and battery life is great. In fact, it lasted over 11 hours on a single charge during our battery-life benchmark. That&rsquo;s impressive for a gaming laptop. There are a few minor nitpicks to be aware of, though.</p>

<p>The fingerprint scanner is downright finicky and the overall aesthetic is uninspiring. The port selection isn&rsquo;t too diverse, either. If you can live with those caveats, the VivoBook Pro 15 OLED is an absolute joy to use and well worth considering. If you&rsquo;re interested in more budget gaming laptop recommendations, be sure to check out our picks for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/621310/the-best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-best-overall-and-more.html">best gaming laptops under $1,500</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/630093/best-gaming-laptops-under-1000.html">best gaming laptops under $1,000</a>.</p>

<p>The Lenovo Slim 7 Pro X combines the rare combination for gaming laptops of being both ultra-lightweight and powerful. Weighing in at just over three pounds, it lives up to the name of ultraportable. In such a tiny package they somehow manage to fit an AMD Ryzen 6900HS CPU and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 GPU. This means that you can expect strong gaming performance even while on the go. </p>

<p>There honestly aren&rsquo;t many knocks against it. While the display is sharp, it&rsquo;s not OLED and the battery life is lacking a little bit. But these are minor inconveniences and don&rsquo;t really take away from the overall appeal of this ultraportable. One thing to note however is that the RTX 3050 GPU is fine for most games, but it won&rsquo;t be able to handle ray tracing, so if playing at the ultra settings is important then you may want to consider a laptop with a more robust graphics card. However, if you&rsquo;re looking for a portable gaming laptop that promises solid performance, the Lenovo Slim 7 Pro X is a great option.</p>

<p>The HP Victus 16 has a really comfortable keyboard, which is great for schoolwork because of longer typing sessions. According to our tester, he was &ldquo;happy to use the keyboard on a long-term basis.&rdquo; HP put a number pad in there as well, which is perfect for gamers. But how does it perform? Well, let&rsquo;s get into the guts then. </p>

<p>This laptop should be able to run most older games on medium to high graphics, as well as everyday tasks like writing papers, browsing the web, and so on. It features an Intel Core i7-11800H CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage. The 16.1-inch display has a resolution of 1920&times;1080 and a refresh rate of 144Hz. The display hinge is a little flimsy though, so you&rsquo;ll want to be mindful when handling it.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t have many knocks against this laptop, but the design is anything but a head-turner, that&rsquo;s for sure. If you can live with the ho-hum design, the Victus 16 is a solid choice, especially if you&rsquo;re on a strict budget.</p>

<p>If you want the cream of the crop, the Alienware x15 R2 is the one to pick. It&rsquo;s rocking an Intel Core i7-12700H CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage. The 15.6-inch display has a resolution of 2560&times;1440 and a maximum refresh rate of 240Hz. Wow. Just wow. It has some quirks, though. The rear ports are difficult to reach and the RAM is soldered on. That said, the features really dominate any drawbacks.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in a position to shell out the cash, the Alienware x15 R2 will surely deliver an out-of-this-world experience.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>



<p>The PCWorld team puts every Windows laptop through a series of intense benchmarks that test GPU and CPU performance, battery life, and so on. The idea is to push the laptop to its limits and then compare it against others we&rsquo;ve tested. Below, you&rsquo;ll find a breakdown of each test and the reasons why we run them.</p>



<h3 id="windows-laptops">Windows laptops</h3>



<ul><li><strong>PCMark 10</strong>: The PCMark 10 benchmark is how we determine how well the laptop handles general use tasks like web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, streaming, and so on.</li><li><strong>HandBrake</strong>: HandBrake is more intensive than PCMark 10. It measures how long a laptop&rsquo;s CPU takes to encode a beefy 30GB file.</li><li><strong>Cinebench</strong>: Cinebench is a brief stress test of the CPU cores. It renders a 2D scene over a short period of time.</li><li><strong>3DMark</strong>: 3DMark checks if 3D performance remains consistent over time by running graphic-intensive clips. This is how we test a gaming laptop&rsquo;s GPU.</li><li><strong>Video rundown test</strong>: To gauge battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 10&rsquo;s Movies &amp; TV app until the laptop dies.</li></ul><h2 id="gaming-laptops-for-students-faq">Gaming laptops for students FAQ</h2>



<p>When it comes to selecting the right laptop, it really depends on what you plan to do with it. Are you going to play lightweight titles like<em> Minecraft</em> or something more visually demanding like&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>? Are you going to use the machine for schoolwork as well? If so, gaming laptops are a great choice, especially for video rendering or graphic design work. Fortunately, you don&rsquo;t need a powerful GPU for something like&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em> or <em>Stardew Valley</em>. The guts, my friends. That&rsquo;s what matters. Below you&rsquo;ll find a simple breakdown on what you should look for.</p>



<h3 id="how-much-graphics-power-will-i-need">How much graphics power will I need?</h3>



<p>The GPU is important because it&rsquo;s the component that determines how smoothly your machine handles games. Fortunately, you don&rsquo;t need the best graphics card to get reliable graphics performance, which is good news if you&rsquo;re on a strict budget. If you&rsquo;re looking to save some cash, go for the GTX 1650. It&rsquo;s an entry-level GPU that&rsquo;s powerful enough for 1080p gaming on mid-to-high graphics. If you need more oomph and higher frame rates, we&rsquo;d suggest shooting for a GTX 1660 Ti or higher, or a more current RTX 30-series GPU.</p>



<h3 id="what-about-processing-power">What about processing power?</h3>



<p>For Intel processors, aim for a 12th-gen Intel Core i5 or i7. For AMD, go with a Ryzen 4000 or 5000. A processor with four cores is good, but six cores or more is better. More cores helps your machine  divvy up the workload.</p>



<h3 id="are-memory-and-storage-options-important">Are memory and storage options important?</h3>



<p>Absolutely! 8GB of RAM is the bare minimum I&rsquo;d recommend, but if you can afford it, go for 16GB instead. This will help overall browser performance, which is important when you&rsquo;re doing schoolwork. Memory is typically upgradeable, so you can always swap it out and add more later on.</p>



<p>Storage directly impacts how many games you can install on your computer. You should get at least 512GB of SSD storage plus a hard drive, as newer titles tend to eat up a ton of space. SSDs load games faster because the data is stored on chips rather than a spinning disk. Plus, SSDs are quieter and more power efficient. You&rsquo;ll also need the space to store homework and so on.</p>



<h3 id="should-i-invest-in-a-top-quality-display">Should I invest in a top-quality display?</h3>



<p>Don&rsquo;t go for anything below 1080p. If the picture isn&rsquo;t sharp enough or is too dim, you can always pick up an external monitor to plug into. For those who suffer from tension headaches due to eye strain (hi!), 4K is the way to go. That said, 4K displays are expensive because they have higher refresh rates and faster response times.</p>



<h3 id="how-long-should-my-laptop-last-on-a-single-charge">How long should my laptop last on a single charge?</h3>



<p>Generally speaking, most gaming laptops have bad battery life. That&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re power-hungry machines. It&rsquo;s a lot of work running an AAA title on ultra graphics, you know? Depending on your use, most gaming laptops will last anywhere from four to six hours on a single charge. However, if you limit your use to schoolwork only, you may be able to squeeze out another hour or two.</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Most computers and storage drives still use the common SATA or PCIe 3.0 interfaces to sling your bits of data around, but if you&rsquo;re lucky enough to own a relatively modern PC, you might be able to upgrade to a solid-state drive (SSD) built on the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3400176/pcie-40-everything-you-need-to-know-specs-compatibility.html">insanely fast PCIe 4.0 protocol</a>.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve tested several PCIe 4.0 SSDs and the best one to cross our labs thus far is the&nbsp;WD Black SN850X&nbsp;in a field of tough contenders, though it&rsquo;s neck-and-neck with the rival Seagate FireCuda 530. Ultimately, due to its better overall performance, the WD Black SN850X takes our top spot.</p>

<p>The WD Black SN850X is a screaming-fast drive and ranks right up next to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394957/seagate-firecuda-530-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">FireCuda 530</a> at the top in terms of speed. The reason we chose the WD Black SN850X at <em>the best</em> PCIe 4.0 is that it offers better value for the money&mdash;not only does it give you the same great speed as the FireCuda, but it does so at a lower price per GB. </p>

<p>Also, in terms of overall performance, the SN850X stands out with its excellent real-world transfer rates and outstanding random write performance. In the crowded field of great PCIe 4.0 SSDs, the WD Black SN850X holds it own at the top despite stiff competition.</p>

<p>The FireCuda 530 is a fast drive. We&rsquo;re talking <em>The Fast and the Furious</em> hit the NOS kind of fast. It&rsquo;s still the only drive to write our 450GB test file in less than 200 seconds. Not only that, but it is the fastest drive in both synthetic benchmarks as well as real-world transfers. It also comes with a very high TBW longevity rating, which means you can write more for longer at those breakneck speeds.</p>

<p>The only reason it doesn&rsquo;t take our top spot is that it&rsquo;s a bit pricey compared to the WD Black SN850X which comes close to the FireCuda&rsquo;s speed. Still, if you&rsquo;re main concern is speed and you have some money to burn, the extra cash will give it to you in droves.</p>

<p>Cutting-edge PCIe 4.0 SSDs don&rsquo;t come cheap. Thankfully the technology is becoming more widespread, allowing for several models to be sold at compelling prices. The best of the affordable bunch? The Crucial P3 Plus. </p>

<p>At just $100 for a 1TB model, the price can&rsquo;t be beat. It also delivers solid overall performance. The P3 Plus isn&rsquo;t the fastest PCIe 4.0 drive, but it has decent real-world transfer rates and in the end, it&rsquo;s still an NVMe. It might be slower than our top-pick PCIe 4.0 SSDs, but it will be a huge improvement if you&rsquo;re upgrading from a SATA drive. If you are looking for a good amount of NVMe storage for cheap, then the Crucial P3 Plus is your best bet.</p>

<p>You may also want to consider Samsung&rsquo;s 980 Pro, which dominated the earliest PCIe 4.0 SSDs. It&rsquo;s since been surpassed by the performance of second-gen PCIe 4.0 drives, but the 980 Pro remains a compelling option, especially if you&rsquo;re looking for a lower-capacity SSD.

<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-an-ssd">What to look for in an SSD</h2>



<p>There are a few things to look out for, but most importantly you&rsquo;ll want to focus on capacity, price, and warranty length. Three-year warranties are standard, but some nicer models are guaranteed for up to five years. And unlike the olden days of SSDs, modern drives won&rsquo;t wear out with normal consumer usage, as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://techreport.com/review/27909/the-SSD-endurance-experiment-theyre-all-dead&amp;xcust=2-2-394512-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tech Report</a> tested and proved years ago with a grueling endurance test.</p>



<p>Another crucial thing to watch out for is the technology used to connect the SSD to your PC. For more details and buying advice you can read our in-depth guide on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3605356/what-type-of-ssd-should-you-buy.html">which type of SSD you should buy</a>.</p>



<ol class="productChart"><li><strong>SATA</strong>: This refers to both the connection type and the transfer protocol, which is used to connect most 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch hard drives and SSDs to your PC. SATA III speeds can hit roughly 600MBps, and most&mdash;but not all&mdash;modern drives max it out. (More on that in the next section.)</li><li><strong>PCIe</strong>: This interface taps into four of your computer&rsquo;s PCIe lanes to blow away SATA speeds, to the tune of nearly 4GBps over PCIe gen 3. Those sort of face-melting speeds pair nicely with supercharged NVMe drives. Both the PCIe lanes in your motherboard and the M.2 slot in your motherboard can be wired to support the PCIe interface, and you can buy adapters that allow you to slot &ldquo;gumstick&rdquo; M.2 drives into a PCIe lane. PCIe 4.0 drives are significantly faster, but require an AMD Ryzen 3000-series or Intel Core 11th-gen (or newer) processor, along with a compatible PCIe 4.0 motherboard.</li><li><strong>NVMe</strong>: Non-Volatile Memory Express technology takes advantage of PCIe&rsquo;s bountiful bandwidth to create blisteringly fast SSDs that blow SATA-based drives out of the water. Check out PCWorld&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2899351/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nvme.html">Everything you need to know about NVMe</a>&rdquo; for a nitty-gritty deep-dive.</li><li><strong>M.2</strong>: This is where things get tricky. Many people assume M.2 drives all use NVMe technology and PCIe speeds, but that&rsquo;s not true. M.2 is just a form factor. Sure, <em>most</em> M.2 SSDs use NVMe, but some still stick to SATA. Do your homework. Many modern Ultrabooks rely on M.2 for storage.</li><li><strong>U.2 and mSATA</strong>: You may also stumble across mSATA and U.2 SSDs, but both motherboard support and product availability are rare for those formats. Some older Ultrabooks included mSATA before M.2 became popular, and drives are still available if you need them.</li></ol><p>Speed matters, of course, but as we said most modern SSDs saturate the SATA III interface. Not all of them, though.</p>



<h2 id="how-we-test-ssds">How we test SSDs</h2>



<p>We test SSDs using a variety of synthetic benchmarks (such as CrystalDiskMark 6&rsquo;s various tests) and real-world tests, including 48GB transfers that showcase how a drive performs during common tasks, and also a demanding 450GB transfer test that pushes an SSD&rsquo;s cache performance to the limit. </p>



<p>The PCIe 4.0 testing was done on an MSI MEG X570 motherboard socketing an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-core CPU, using the same Kingston DRAM, cards, and software. All testing is performed on an empty, or nearly empty drive. Note: performance will decrease as the drive fills up.</p>

## Alienware’s new ultrawide QD-OLED monitor drops the price (and the G-Sync)
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1376879/alienwares-new-oled-monitor-drops-the-price-and-the-g-sync.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1376879/alienwares-new-oled-monitor-drops-the-price-and-the-g-sync.html)

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Dell burst onto the gaming monitor scene earlier this year with the Alienware AW3423DW, a 34-inch ultrawide that was pricey, but still the best deal around when it comes to that sweet ultra-vibrant quantum dot OLED panel. (Oh, and a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/624305/alienware-aw3423dw-review-quantum-dot-oled-makes-rival-monitors-feel-obsolete.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">PCWorld Editor&rsquo;s Choice!</a>) The company is bringing it back again for a nearly-identical model, the AW3423DWF, which swaps Nvidia&rsquo;s G-Sync for the more general AMD FreeSync Premium Pro system. It&rsquo;s launching later this year for a slightly more affordable $1099.99, $200 off the price of the original design. </p>



<p>A thousand bucks and change is still a lot of money for any monitor, but this model makes a compelling argument that it still counts as a value. It&rsquo;s the cheapest QD-OLED screen you can get designed for PC gaming (unless you find a deal on a smaller OLED TV), and with 165Hz of refresh rate, a claimed 0.1ms gray-to-gray refresh rate, and the usual 3440&times;1440 ultrawide resolution, it&rsquo;s packing the specs that a lot of gamers crave. Yes, it&rsquo;s nearly identical to the previous model, but this one comes clad in black plastic all over instead of the panda-ish look, with a somewhat gaudy &ldquo;34&rdquo; LED lighting up the rear. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Alienware OLED monitor front and back" class="wp-image-1376908" height="476" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/aw3423dwf-cfp-01-bk-rgb.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dell</p></div>



<p>The shift from Nvidia to AMD branding for the refresh system probably won&rsquo;t matter too much &mdash; anyone planning to drop this much cash on a monitor can put out frames fast enough, and FreeSync works with Radeon and GeForce GPUs alike (unlike the Nvidia-only G-Sync). BConnections include two DisplayPort 1.4 ports, one HDMI 2.0 port, four USB 3.2 gen1 ports (two on the bottom bezel for easy access), and headphone jacks on the bottom and rear. It&rsquo;s a shame that there&rsquo;s still no USB-C option on a screen this expensive, though. </p>



<p>Gamers can go with the elaborate built-in stand or the usual 100x100mm VESA mount, but get one that&rsquo;s sturdy if you replace it &mdash; this thing is nearly 14 pounds for the screen alone. Along with refreshed Aurora desktops packing the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">latest Nvidia RTX 4090 cards</a> and a new tenkeyless mechanical keyboard, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://dell.alienwarearena.com/alienware-upgrades-flagship-desktop-reveals-tenkeyless-keyboard-and-new-qd-oled-display/&amp;xcust=2-2-1376879-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the AW3423DWF will launch &ldquo;later this fall.&rdquo;</a> </p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>When the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090</a> was announced with an eye-watering $1,600 price tag, memes spread like wildfire. While $1,600 is a little too much for most gamers to spend on a single component (most PC build budgets I see are less than that for the whole PC). I couldn&rsquo;t help but be intrigued at the potential performance improvements for my <em>work</em>&mdash;you know, the 3D and AI-accelerated tasks I spend most of my day doing as part of managing the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRBHiacaQb5S70pljtJYB2g&amp;xcust=2-1-1375901-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">EposVox YouTube channel</a>, instead of gaming.</p>



<p>Spoiler alert: The GeForce RTX 4090&rsquo;s content creation performance is magical. In quite a few cases, the typically nonsense &ldquo;2X performance increase&rdquo; is actually true. But not everywhere.</p>

<h2>Our test setup</h2>



<p>Most of my benchmarking was performed on this test bench:</p>



<ul><li>Intel Core i9-12900k CPU</li><li>32GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5 5200MT/s RAM</li><li>ASUS ROG STRIX Z690-E Gaming Wifi Motherboard</li><li>EVGA G3 850W PSU</li><li>Source files stored on a PCIe gen 4 NVMe SSD</li></ul><p>My objectives were to see how much of an upgrade the RTX 4090 would be over the previous generation <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393531/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-founders-edition-review.html">GeForce RTX 3090</a>, as well as the RTX Titan (the card I was primarily working on before). The RTX 3090 really saw minimal improvements over the RTX Titan for my use cases, so I wasn&rsquo;t sure if the 4090 would really be a big leap. For some more hardcore testing later as I&rsquo;ll mention, testing was done on this test bench.</p>



<ul><li>AMD Threadripper Pro 3975WX CPU</li><li>256GB Kingston ECC DDR4 RAM</li><li>ASUS WRX80 SAGE Motherboard</li><li>BeQuiet 1400W PSU</li><li>Source files stored on a PCIe gen 4 NVMe SSD</li></ul><p>Each test featured each GPU in the same config as to not mix results.</p>



<h2>Video production</h2>



<p>My day job is, of course, creating YouTube content, so one of the first things I had to test would be the benefits I might see for creating video content. Using <a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/PugetBench-for-Premiere-Pro-1519/">PugetBench</a> from the workstation builders at Puget Systems, Adobe Premiere Pro sees very minimal performance improvement with the RTX 4090 (as to be expected at this point).</p>

<p>BlackMagic DaVinci Resolve, however, saw <strong>significant</strong> performance improvements across the board over both the RTX 3090 and RTX Titan. This makes sense, as Resolve is far more optimized for GPU workflows than Premiere Pro. Renders were much faster thanks both to the higher 3D compute on effects, but also the faster encoding hardware onboard&mdash;and the general playback and workflow was much more &ldquo;snappier&rdquo; feeling and responsive.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 content creation performance" class="wp-image-1375935" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4090-Resolve-GPU.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been editing with the GeForce RTX 4090 for a few weeks now, and the experience has been great&mdash;though I had to revert back to the public release of Resolve so I haven&rsquo;t been able to export using the AV1 encoder for most of my videos.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 content creation performance" class="wp-image-1375925" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4090-resolve-encode-speed.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>I also wanted to test to see if the AI hardware improvements would benefit Resolve&rsquo;s Magic Mask tool for rotoscoping, or their face tracker for the Face Refinement plugin. Admittedly, I was hoping to see more improvements from the RTX 4090 here, but there is <em>an improvement</em>, which saves me time and is a win. These tasks are tedious and slow, so any minutes I can shave off makes my life easier. Perhaps in time more optimization can be done specific to the new architecture changes in Lovelace (the RTX 40-series&rsquo; underlying GPU architecture codename).</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 content creation performance" class="wp-image-1375926" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4090-Object-Mask.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 content creation performance" class="wp-image-1375930" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4090-FaceTrack.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>The performance in my original Resolve benchmarks impressed me enough that I decided to build a second-tier test using my Threadripper Pro workstation; rendering and exporting a 8K video with 8K RAW source footage, lots of effects and Super Scale (Resolve&rsquo;s internal &ldquo;smart&rdquo; upscaler) on 4K footage, etc. This project is no joke, the normal high-tier gaming cards just errored out because their lower VRAM quantities couldn&rsquo;t handle the project&mdash; this bumps the RTX 3060, 2080, and 3080 out of the running. But putting the 24GB VRAM monsters to the test, the RTX 4090 exported the projects a whole 8 minutes faster than the test. <strong>Eight minutes.</strong> That kind of time scaling is game changing for single person workflows like mine.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 content creation performance" class="wp-image-1375922" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4090-8k.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>If you&rsquo;re a high res or effect-heavy video editor, the RTX 4090 is already going to save you hours of waiting and slower working, right out of the gate and we haven&rsquo;t even talked about encoding speeds yet.</p>



<h2>Video encoding</h2>



<p>For simply transcoding video in H.264 and H.265, the GeForce RTX 4090 also just runs laps around previous Nvidia GPUs. H.265 is the only area where AMD out-performs Nvidia in encoder speed (though not necessarily quality) as ever since the Radeon 5000 GPUs, AMD&rsquo;s HEVC encoder has been blazing fast.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 content creation performance" class="wp-image-1375929" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4090-handbrake-h264.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>The new Ada Lovelace architecture also comes with new dual encoder chips that individually already run a fair bit faster for H.264 and H.265 encoding than Ampere and Turing, but they also encode AV1&mdash;the new, open-source video codec from the Alliance for Open Media.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 content creation performance" class="wp-image-1375927" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4090-handbrake-h265.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>AV1 is the future of web-streamed video, with most major companies involved in media streaming also being members of the consortium. The goal is to create a highly efficient (as in, better quality per bit) video codec that can meet the needs of the modern high resolution, high frame rate, and HDR streaming world, while avoiding the high licensing and patent costs associated with H.265 (HEVC) and H.266 codecs. Intel was first to market with hardware AV1 encoders with their Arc GPUs <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/827992/tested-intel-arc-av1-video-encoder-vs-nvidia-amd.html">as I covered for PCWorld here</a>&mdash;now Nvidia brings it to their GPUs.</p>



<p>I cannot get completely accurate quality comparisons between Intel and Nvidia&rsquo;s AV1 encoders yet due to limited software support. From the basic tests I could do, Nvidia&rsquo;s AV1 encodes are on par with Intel&rsquo;s&mdash;but I have since found out that the encoder implementations in even the software I <em>can</em> use them in both could use some fine-tuning to best represent both sides.</p>



<p>Performance-wise, AV1 performs about as fast as H.265/HEVC on the RTX 4090. Which is fine. But the new dual encoder chips allow both H.265 and AV1 to be used to encode 8K60 video, or just faster 4K60 video. They do this by splitting up the video frames into horizontal halves, encoding the halves on the separate chips, and then stitching back together before finalizing the stream. This sounds like how Intel&rsquo;s Hyper Encode was supposed to work&mdash;Hyper Encoder instead separating GOPs (Group of Pictures or frames) among the iGPU and dGPU with Arc&mdash;but in all of my tests, I only found Hyper Encode to slow down the process, rather than speeding it up. (Plus it didn&rsquo;t work with AV1.)</p>



<h2>Streaming</h2>



<p>As a result of the aforementioned improvements in encoder speed, streaming and recording your screen, camera, or gameplay is a far, far better experience. This comes with an update to the NVENC encoder SDK within OBS Studio, now presenting users with 7 presets (akin to X264&rsquo;s &ldquo;CPU Usage Presets&rdquo;) scaling from P1 being the fastest/lowest quality to P7 being the slowest/best quality. In my testing in this video, P6 and P7 were basically the exact same result on RTX 2000, 3000, and 4000 GPUs, and competed with X264 VerySlow in quality.</p>



<p>While game streaming, I saw mostly the same performance recording as other GPUs in <em>Spider-Man Remastered</em> (though other games will see more benefits) with H.264, but then encoding with AV1&hellip; had negligible impact on game performance at all. It was virtually transparent. You wouldn&rsquo;t even know you were recording, even on the highest quality preset. I even had enough headroom to set OBS to an 8K canvas and upscale my 1440p game capture to 8k within OBS and record using the dual encoder chips, and still not see a significant impact.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 content creation performance" class="wp-image-1375936" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RTX-4090-Review-YouTube.mov_snapshot_15.55.552.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>Unfortunately, while Nvidia&rsquo;s Shadowplay feature does get 8K60 support on Lovelace via the dual encoders, only HEVC is supported at this time. Hopefully AV1 can be implemented&mdash;and supported for all resolutions, as HEVC only works for 8K or HDR as is&mdash;soon.</p>



<p>I also found that the GeForce RTX 4090 is now fast enough to do completely lossless 4:4:4 HEVC recording at 4K 60FPS&mdash;something prior generations simply cannot do. 4:4:4 chroma subsampling is important for maintaining text clarity and for keeping the image intact when zooming in on small elements like I do for videos, and at 4K it&rsquo;s kind of been a &ldquo;white whale&rdquo; of mine, as the throughput on RTX 2000/3000 hasn&rsquo;t been enough or the OBS implementation of 4:4:4 isn&rsquo;t optimized enough. Unfortunately 4:4:4 isn&rsquo;t possible in AV1 on these cards, at all.</p>



<h2><a></a>Photo editing</h2>



<p>Photo editing sees virtually zero improvement on the GeForce RTX 4090. There&rsquo;s a slight score increase on the Adobe Photoshop PugetBench tests versus previous generations, but nothing worth buying a new card over.</p>

<p>Same goes for Lightroom Classic. Shame.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 content creation performance" class="wp-image-1375937" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4090-Affinity.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>But if you&rsquo;re an Affinity Photo user, the RTX 4090 far outperforms other GPUs, I&rsquo;m not sure whether to interpret that Affinity is more or less optimized in this case.</p>



<h2>A.I.</h2>



<p>AI is all the rage these days, and AI upscalers are in high demand right now. Theoretically, the GeForce RTX 4090&rsquo;s improved AI hardware would benefit these workflows&mdash;and we mostly see this ring true. The RTX 4090 tops the charts for fastest upscaling in Topaz Labs Video Enhance AI and Gigapixel, as well as ON1 Resize AI 2022.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 content creation performance" class="wp-image-1375941" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4090-TopazLabs-VEAI.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 content creation performance" class="wp-image-1375938" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Topaz-Gigapixel.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>But Topaz&rsquo;s new PhotoAI app sees weirdly low performance in all Nvidia cards. I&rsquo;ve been told this may be a bug, but a fix has yet to be distributed.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 content creation performance" class="wp-image-1375934" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4090-Topaz-PhotoAI.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>Using FlowFrames to AI interpolate 60FPS footage to 120FPS for slow-mo usage, the RTX 4090 sees a 20 percent speed-up compared to the RTX 4090. This is nice as it is, but I&rsquo;ve been told by users in the FlowFrames Discord server that this could theoretically scale more as optimizations for Lovelace are developed.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 content creation performance" class="wp-image-1375928" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4090-flowframes.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>What about generating AI Art? I tested N00mkrad&rsquo;s Stable Diffusion GUI and found that the GeForce RTX 4090 blew away all previous GPUs in both half and full-precision generation&mdash;and once again have been told the results &ldquo;should be&rdquo; higher, even. Exciting times.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 content creation performance" class="wp-image-1375932" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4090-Stable-Diffusion.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<h2><a></a>3D rendering</h2>



<p>Alright, the bold &ldquo;2X Faster&rdquo; claims are here. I wanted to test 3D workflows on my Threadripper Pro rig, since I&rsquo;ve been getting more and more into these new tools in 2022.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 content creation performance" class="wp-image-1375920" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4090-blender-monster.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 content creation performance" class="wp-image-1375921" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4090-blender-junkshop.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>Testing Blender, both the Monster and Classroom benchmark scenes have the RTX 4090 rendering twice as fast as the RTX 3090, with the Junkshop scene rendering just shy of 2X faster.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 content creation performance" class="wp-image-1375943" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4090-blender-classroom.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>This translates not only to faster final renders&mdash;which at scale is absolutely massive&mdash;but a <em>much</em> smoother creative process as all of the actual preview/viewport work will be more fluid and responsive, too, and you can more easily preview the final results without waiting forever.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 content creation performance" class="wp-image-1375940" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4090-octane.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>Benchmarking Octane&mdash;a renderer used by 3D artists and VFX creators in Cinema4D, Blender, and Unity&mdash;again has the RTX 4090 running twice as fast as the RTX 3090.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 content creation performance" class="wp-image-1375933" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4090-vray.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>&hellip;and again, the same goes for V-Ray in both CUDA and RTX workflows.</p>



<h2 id="bottom-line-the-geforce-rtx-4090-offers-outstanding-value-to-content-creators">Bottom line: The GeForce RTX 4090 offers outstanding value to content creators</h2>



<p>That&rsquo;s where the value is. The Titan RTX was $2,500, and it was already phenomenal to get that performance for $1,500 with the RTX 3090. Now for $100 more, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">GeForce RTX 4090</a> runs laps around prior GPUs in ways that have truly game-changing impacts on workflows for creators of all kinds.</p>



<p>This might explain why the formerly-known-as-Quadro line of cards got far less emphasis over the past few years, too. Why buy a $5,000+ graphics card when you can get the same performance (or more, Quadros were never super fast, they just had lots of VRAM) for $1,600?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure><p>Obviously the pricing of the $1,200 RTX 4080 and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1354391/nvidia-cancels-the-controversial-rtx-4080-12gb.html">recently un-launched $899 4080 12GB</a> can still be concerning until we see independent testing numbers, but the GeForce RTX 4090 might just be the first time marketing has boasted of &ldquo;2x faster&rdquo; performance on a product and I feel like I&rsquo;ve actually received that promise. Especially for results within my niche work interests instead of mainstream tools or gaming? This is awesome.</p>



<p>Pure gamers probably shouldn&rsquo;t spend $1,600 on a graphics card, unless feeding a high refresh rate 4K monitor with no compromises is a goal. But if you&rsquo;re interested in getting real, nitty-gritty content creation work done <em>fast</em>, the GeForce RTX 4090 can&rsquo;t be beat&mdash;and it&rsquo;ll make you grin from ear to ear during any late-night <em>Call of Duty </em>sessions you hop into, as well. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft used to offer just one Xbox controller, leaving it to third parties to fill any specific niches, but no more. It launched the first Elite Controller in the Xbox One era, and it followed that up with the revamped <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398272/xbox-elite-controller-series-2-review-more-of-the-same-but-better.html">Series 2 Elite controller</a> in 2019. However, at almost $200 it&rsquo;s pricey, and even dedicated gamers may scoff at the expense. Now, the Elite Controller Series 2 Core has entered the game. This controller has a few aesthetic changes from the standard Elite, and it doesn&rsquo;t come with the accessories kit, but it&rsquo;s priced at a more reasonable $130.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t need all the add-ons, the Core is a great way to save some cash while getting a more feature-rich Xbox controller. But if you end up wanting the accessories, it will just cost you more in the long run. Still, this could be the sweet spot for some gamers.</p>



<h2 id="elite-controller-series-2-core-design-and-build-quality">Elite Controller Series 2 Core: Design and build quality</h2>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Series 2 Core controller has the same shape and profile as the Series 2 Elite, which itself is almost identical to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/831843/xbox-wireless-controller-review.html">2020 base model controller</a> that ships with the Xbox Series S and Series X. If you&rsquo;re coming from the regular controller, as most will, the first thing you&rsquo;ll probably notice about the Series 2 Core is the rubberized grips. They feel much more secure in the hand than the all-plastic design of the standard Xbox gamepad, and the dot texture is present all the way around. The Elite Series 2 has the same texture, but the entire controller is black&mdash;the Core has a two-tone white/black colorway that we think looks pretty sharp.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 Core" class="wp-image-1367336" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/elite-core-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 Core has rubberized grips that feel much more secure than the plastic of the standard controllers.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Ryan Whitwam</p></div>



<p>The top edge sports the USB-C port for charging and wired gameplay, along with the pairing button. It comes with an 8-foot USB-A-to-C cable, too. One thing you won&rsquo;t see is a seam for the battery compartment. Unlike the base model, this controller has an integrated rechargeable battery. Previously, you had to go all the way up to the $180 Elite Series 2 for that luxury. Look farther down on the back, and you&rsquo;ll understand why the Series 2 Core is only $130.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Core doesn&rsquo;t include Microsoft&rsquo;s accessory package, but the controller is fully compatible with it. Thus, you have four slots for rear paddle buttons. Not having them makes the controller look a bit incomplete, but admittedly, you&rsquo;re not going to spend a lot of time staring at the back of your gamepad. Also on the back are switches to change the travel of the triggers. That&rsquo;s useful if you want to tune the experience for specific games. For example, you might want the short throw for shooters, but the longer travel is ideal for racing games where the trigger is your throttle. The switches are a bit fiddly and hard to adjust on the fly, though.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the face of the controller, you&rsquo;ll find all the buttons in the usual Xbox layout. The ABXY cluster doesn&rsquo;t have the color-coding of the cheaper controller, which makes for a more understated look. There&rsquo;s also an LED profile indicator in the middle. The d-pad has the same metal dish shape as the full-priced Elite Series 2, which feels nicer under your finger than even the improved plastic d-pad on the regular model. The Core has the same removable controls as the non-Core Elite gamepad, too. Both the d-pad and thumbsticks are held in place with magnets, and they feel completely stable&mdash;no wobble or clicking&mdash;until you pull straight up. Since the Core doesn&rsquo;t come with the accessory bundle, you&rsquo;ll probably leave these in place.</p>



<h2 id="elite-controller-series-2-core-features-and-hands-on-experience">Elite Controller Series 2 Core: Features and hands-on experience</h2>



<p>If you&rsquo;re switching from the standard Xbox controller, you&rsquo;ll notice the added heft of the Elite Core. It&rsquo;s 300 grams (10.58 ounces), whereas the regular controller (with batteries installed) is 250g. The balance of the controller is still good, though, and we found it perfectly comfortable for long gaming sessions. The adjustable triggers also help to limit unnecessary movement as most games don&rsquo;t need the full range of motion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because it does so much more, the Elite Core needs firmware updates. In fact, it won&rsquo;t work correctly out of the box until you update it. On Windows, you&rsquo;ll need to download the Xbox accessories app, but the Xbox console will already know how to update your peripherals.</p>



<p>Microsoft says the controller can run about 40 hours wirelessly on a charge, and that&rsquo;s only a tiny bit higher than our real-world numbers. It runs long enough you might lose track of the cable, but happily, it charges with standard USB-C. There are pogo pins on the back for the controller charging dock, but that&rsquo;s an unnecessary add-on when USB-C is so prevalent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the buttons on the Elite Controller Series 2 Core are smooth and appropriately tactile. The sound is a bit quieter and deeper than the standard controller, save for the triggers, which are much louder if you use the middle or short travel positions. We&rsquo;re impressed that the thumbsticks feel so solid even when you&rsquo;re spinning them furiously&mdash;you&rsquo;d never know they pop off unless you pull upward on them.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 Core" class="wp-image-1367338" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/elite-core-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The thumbsticks on the Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 Core feel surprisingly solid considering they are removable.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Ryan Whitwam</p></div>



<p>The cheaper 2020 controller added a share button in the middle of the face, but the Elite Core has a lot more going on. The button in that position lets you switch between the controller&rsquo;s three customizable profiles, as indicated with the aforementioned profile LED indicator. The profiles let you control what each button does, adjust your trigger dead zones, tweak the vibration, invert the thumbsticks, and even change the Xbox button&rsquo;s color.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Elite Core has even more functionality if you need it. You can assign a button to &ldquo;shift,&rdquo; which activates secondary functions for any button of your choosing. So you lose instant access to the share feature, but this is a very powerful upgrade over the base model controller. However, you might not have a button to devote to shift unless you splurge on the accessory kit to get the paddles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You do miss out on some of the controller&rsquo;s functionality by not having the accessory kit, which Microsoft will sell you separately for $60. That puts the total price slightly higher than if you&rsquo;d just bought the non-Core Elite controller, which comes with the kit.</p>

<h2 id="elite-controller-series-2-core-compatibility">Elite Controller Series 2 Core: Compatibility</h2>



<p>The Elite Core gamepad pairs perfectly with the Xbox Series X and S, but its Bluetooth functionality means it can also talk to myriad other devices. To pair with other devices over Bluetooth, long-press the pair button next to the USB-C port and select it on your phone or PC. A double-tap of that button will move the controller back to the Xbox, if it&rsquo;s paired with one.</p>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows OS naturally has full integration, including the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/xbox-accessories/9NBLGGH30XJ3&amp;xcust=2-2-1367331-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Xbox Accessories app</a> for conjuring the controller&rsquo;s advanced features. You can also connect it to an Android or iOS mobile device over Bluetooth, but you&rsquo;ll have to use the desktop app and a USB-C cable to change settings.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 Core" class="wp-image-1367340" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/elite-core-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Ryan Whitwam</p></div>



<p>Speaking of the USB-C port, that&rsquo;s another way you can connect to the controller. It works in wired mode for PC and Xbox. While we had no trouble using the base model Xbox controller in wired mode with Android, that&rsquo;s not the case for the Elite Core. For whatever reason, it will only charge when connected to a phone&rsquo;s USB-C port.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 Core" class="wp-image-1367341" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/elite-core-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 Core with its charging cable.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Ryan Whitwam</p></div>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-an-elite-controller-series-2-core">Should you buy an Elite Controller Series 2 Core?</h2>



<p>The Elite Controller Series 2 Core adds a ton of features you don&rsquo;t get with Microsoft&rsquo;s standard controller, including profiles, better grips, button remapping, and adjustable triggers. However, you lose out on some of what the hardware <em>can </em>do by not getting the bundled accessory kit, which comes with the full-priced Elite Series 2 kit. The rear-facing paddle button connectors are useless unless you spend more on accessories, and it&rsquo;s pointless to have removable buttons when you don&rsquo;t have the alternative controls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For mobile and PC gamers, the Elite Core does offer a better experience than the base model gamepad. The built-in battery means you can take the Elite Core controller on the road and charge it with a regular USB-C cable, but you might not even have to bother given the robust battery life. However, the lack of wired USB-C support on smartphones is a bummer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For casual gamers who don&rsquo;t want button profiles or adjustable triggers, it&rsquo;s best to stick with the cheaper Xbox controller. Serious gamers should probably still spring for the full Elite controller kit. It&rsquo;s more expensive, but you get all the accessories you might end up buying anyway. Buying the Elite Core and the accessory kit separately is $10 more than just buying the full Elite bundle. For those few in the middle, the Elite Core is a great piece of hardware. The $130 asking price is steep but justifiable as long as you are confident you won&rsquo;t want the accessories after you start tinkering with the Elite Controller Series 2 Core.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d like to see Chromebooks with larger screens and more memory (such as the Acer Chromebook 317) go below $300, but $319 is still a pretty decent price. The HP Chromebook 11 deal is the absolute minimum you should buy in terms of specifications, but there&rsquo;s still a place for ultra-cheap Chromebooks, and that HP&rsquo;s price is the lowest it&rsquo;s been in a year.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Early Black Friday sales have already begun at several retailers. The &ldquo;Black Friday&rdquo; deals season is like Halloween or Christmas, meaning that actually lasts several weeks.</p>

<h3 id="what-should-i-look-for-in-a-black-friday-chromebook">What should I look for in a Black Friday Chromebook?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>We still expect low-end Chromebooks&mdash;say, those with a 768p screen, Intel Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM and 16GB of SSD storage&mdash;to be priced about $100. And if they get much below $100, they become essentially a stocking stuffer for most people.</p>



<p>That said, look for these specs in a <em>respectable </em>Chromebook: an Intel Celeron N4000 chip or higher, 8GB of RAM, and a 1080p screen. A Pentium Silver N6000 processor is a step up from that. A Core m3-8100Y <em>isn&rsquo;t</em>, but may still be satisfactory.</p>



<p>More memory (that is, 8GB rather 4GB of RAM) will allow for more browser tabs and a smoother browser experience. A 1080p screen will offer a comfortable laptop-like viewing experience. Onboard storage really doesn&rsquo;t matter all that much, though at least 32GB is preferable storing for apps, screenshots, and the like.</p>

We try to factor that in, so you won&rsquo;t get stuck with a Chromebook that will lose support in the near future.</p>
