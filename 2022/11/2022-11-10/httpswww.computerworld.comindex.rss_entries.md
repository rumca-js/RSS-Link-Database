<p>Apple has announced it will invest $450 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to develop the  infrastructure that allows off-grid backpackers to call for help when outside mobile coverage.</p><h2><strong>Is that all there is?</strong></h2>
<p>Apple’s <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3672932/after-apples-iphone-14-launch-event-a-few-things-to-consider.html">iPhone 14</a> is the company’s first-ever <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3631589/analyst-iphone-13-may-be-a-satellite-phone.html">satellite phone</a>. Or to be more accurate, it’s a step toward becoming one. You can’t make calls on it, but you will soon be able to use the satellite connection to send messages to emergency services from across the US and Canada. This could be a life saver.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3679690/apple-to-spend-450m-on-sos-via-satellite-for-iphones.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p><em>Disclosure: Dell is a client of the author.</em></p><p>There is an increasing chance many of us will experience layoffs shortly — and last week’s <a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/11/05/elon-musks-twitter-takeover-is-a-disaster-how-much-longer-will-the-platform-hold/" rel="nofollow">Twitter job-cuts disaster</a> is a rolling showcase of how not to do one.</p><p>Let’s look at the Twitter acquisition and layoff trainwreck and how you can assure the groups you’re in (or who report to you) remain viable in the face of job cuts or a corporate acquisition. </p><h2>The Twitter vs. Dell process</h2>
<p>Dell has the best acquisition process on the planet. What makes it so good is this: Dell does a lot of due diligence and planning at the front end and accepts the related risk of having to sideline executives for up to a year if the acquisition doesn’t go through. This measures the risk of losing the productivity of a handful of people against losing the productivity of the entire acquired unit. So far, every Dell acquisition I’ve tracked has not only been successful, but the acquired company outperformed its previous status. (This last is very unusual; most acquisitions fail to meet expectations.)</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3679692/in-the-shadow-of-the-twitter-disaster-how-to-prep-for-layoffs.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Friends, emailers, internet persons: Lend me your ears — 'cause my goodness, have I got one heck of an incredible Gmail treasure to share with ye today.</p><p>It's an entire system of advanced add-ons that I'm pretty sure has been largely forgotten. I know <em>I'd</em> forgotten all about it until just the other day, when I was poking around in my inbox (as one does) and suddenly found myself making a hilariously cartoony slack-jawed expression whilst guffawing with glee.</p><p>And lemme tell ya: If you're anywhere near as obsessed with efficiency as I am, you're about to be doing some slack-jawed guffawing of your own.</p><p>Let me quickly set the stage before we dive in: These add-ons are part of an official <a href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/category/works-with-gmail" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Google Workspace Marketplace platform</a> that I'm pretty sure precisely four people have visited in the past six months.

<p>About six in 10 executives believe they can achieve their corporate sustainability goals over the next year, according to a recent global survey commissioned by Honeywell International. But only about 16% think they'll do so primarily through technology-driven changes, such as upgrading or replacing existing systems with newer, more efficient or more sustainable technologies.</p><p>The vast majority of the 600 business leaders surveyed — 62% — expect to hit their short-term goals mainly by modifying or eliminating operational processes or business behaviors.</p><p>Sustainability has become an increasingly hot-button issue in recent years for companies looking to reduce their carbon emissions. The idea is that by making changes now, they will see a substantial return on investment later, spend less on energy and materials, and build up infrastructure resiliency to weather-related catastrophes. </p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3679508/corporate-execs-confident-on-sustainability-goals-admit-more-work-needed.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
