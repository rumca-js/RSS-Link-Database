On rightwing social media, people were emotionally debating the alleged toxicity of the former president and his hand-picked nominees, while Fox News highlighted the victory of Georgia secretary of state <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republican-brad-raffensperger-reviled-trump-wins-again-georgia\">Brad Raffensperger</a>, emphasizing that he is \u201creviled by Trump\u201d, while heralding the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/\">dominating win</a>\u201d of Florida governor Ron DeSantis. A <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/south-florida-shift-helps-desantis-rubio-cruise-victory\">Fox News contributor</a> pronounced DeSantis \u201cthe new Republican party leader\u201d. In fact, the idea that DeSantis is the big Republican winner of the midterms \u2013 and Trump the big loser \u2013 seems to be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/09/trump-desantis-election-2024-florida\">broad consensus</a> in today\u2019s media.</p><p>There is, of course, at least one dissonant voice: Trump himself. Sensing that the tables are turning rapidly, he went on Fox News to warn DeSantis to stay out of the 2024 presidential election. In his typical Mafioso way, Trump <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-senate-republican-leadership-change-warns-potential-2024-gop-candidates-against-running\">said</a>, \u201cI don\u2019t know if he is running.

Its franchises have already taken January by buying up new leagues in South Africa and the United Arab Emirates, the same organisations are eyeing up The Hundred in England and the Big Bash in Australia should private investment be invited, and as salary caps increase they will soon be able to pay players amounts that even the richest national boards cannot match.</p><p>For all of that, hegemony on the field has not yet been established.

Alexi is away this week so I am once again filling in with the week\u2019s pod recommendations.<br /><br />This week saw the release of If Books Could Kill, a new show from Michael Hobbes, formerly of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/15/ok-but-hear-me-out-the-five-best-podcasts-to-change-your-mind\">You\u2019re Wrong About</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.fivefourpod.com/\">5-4\u2019s</a> Peter Shamshiri. The show digs into \u201cairport bestsellers that captured our hearts and ruined our minds\u201d. The first episode is all about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/15/freakonomics-10-years-on-stephen-dubner-steven-levitt-interview\">Freakonomics</a>, and whether the data in the hit 2005 book definitely supports the trends \u2013 on crime, race, and more \u2013 it claims to.<br /><br />It\u2019s not Hobbes\u2019s first foray into the \u201cdebunking culture\u201d pod subgenre; as well as You\u2019re Wrong About, he also hosts <a href=\"https://www.maintenancephase.com/\">Maintenance Phase</a>, on wellness-themed misinformation. It is, personally, one of my favourite types of audio series; the British \u201ctech pessimist\u201d podcast <a href=\"https://www.trashfuture.co.uk/\">Trashfuture</a> is a frequent go-to for tales of startup-themed miscreancy and eccentricity.<br /><br />What do I like about these podcasts so much? As well as appealing to the cynical (hi!), I think it\u2019s the fact that the \u201cdebunking culture\u201d pods are often actually where much podcast comedy occurs, melding analysis with chat, and politics with real life. However, falling firmly down a rabbit hole of any kind \u2013 even if you\u2019re far from a conspiracy theorist \u2013 is always a risk, so I\u2019m happy that If Books Could Kill has gone for a weekly release schedule rather than putting out a series all in one go. Books, gladly, cannot kill \u2013 and neither can debunking podcasts \u2013 but they can certainly overwhelm your brain if you binge them. <br /><br />Read on for a varied set of picks this week \u2013 including a new series on Bin Laden\u2019s rise to infamy \u2013 and five of the best podcasts to get you feeling greenfingered and in touch with nature.<br /><br /><em><strong>Hannah J Davies</strong><br />Deputy editor, newsletters</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/10/hear-here-podcast-bin-laden-files\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/10/us-estimates-200000-military-casualties-all-sides-ukraine-war", "title": "US estimates 200,000 military casualties on all sides in Ukraine war", "date_published": "2022-11-10 09:44:39+00:00", "description": "<p>US general\u2019s remarks come as experts say potential winter lull in fighting could offer chance for negotiations</p><p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/10/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-kyiv-wary-of-moscows-retreat-from-kherson-us-general-estimates-100000-russian-military-casualties\">Russia-Ukraine war \u2013 latest news updates</a></p><p>America\u2019s top general has estimated that 100,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in Ukraine, and that Kyiv\u2019s armed forces have \u201cprobably\u201d suffered a similar level of casualties in the war.</p><p>Gen Mark Milley also suggested that as many as 40,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed after being caught up in the conflict.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/10/us-estimates-200000-military-casualties-all-sides-ukraine-war\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/10/big-rise-in-number-of-fossil-fuel-lobbyists-at-cop27-climate-summit", "title": "Big rise in number of fossil fuel lobbyists at Cop27 climate summit", "date_published": "2022-11-10 09:32:49+00:00", "description": "<p>Oil and gas industries have 636 representatives at Egypt conference \u2013 a rise of more than 25% on last year </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2022/nov/10/cop27-egypt-climate-crisis-environment-fossil-fuel-lobbyists-latest-live\">Cop27 live \u2013 latest news updates</a></li></ul><p>There are more than 600 fossil fuel lobbyists at the Cop27 climate conference, a rise of more than 25% from last year and outnumbering any one frontline community affected by the climate crisis.</p><p>There are 636 lobbyists from the oil and gas industries registered to attend the UN event in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.
