Kevin Costner plays John Dutton, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/yellowstone-season-five-trailer\" target=\"_blank\">who gets elected governor</a>. But it wasn't the first time Costner has been involved in politics this year. You all remember this unfortunate photo where <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kevin-costner-yellowstone-quits\" target=\"_blank\">Kevin Costner</a> endorsed Liz Cheney in her primary. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1b506\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32074828&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>Y'all know the story with Liz. She joined the January 6th committee. Her constituents were pissed about it. They endorsed another candidate who jollystomped her in a primary. As of January first, Liz Cheney is gone to start her new career as an MSNBC contributor or something.</p><p>Why did Costner make the endorsement, though? That's the question and USA Today got the answer. <a href=\"https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2022/11/10/kevin-costner-opens-up-on-supporting-liz-cheney-she-wasnt-going-to-win-but-i-appreciated-her-brave-clear-headed-stance/\" target=\"_blank\">I'm linking to Whiskey Riff instead</a> since I like them more.</p><blockquote>Just because you lose doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re done; it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re even wrong. I was clear that (Cheney) probably wasn\u2019t going to win her election. But I wanted to let her know, as a citizen, how much I appreciated her brave, clear-headed stance.</blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8e3f1\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32074918&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>C'mon, dude. </p><p>I never had the bandwidth to have strong opinions about a congresswoman from Wyoming. I got redistricted three times this year in my own state and had a hard enough time worrying about my own representation. But Liz is most definitely done. At least in politics. Cheney can still make some coin as an MSNBC News contributor.</p><p>And the bars about Cheney being \"brave\" and \"clear-headed\" is silly and why people roll their eyes when actors say something other than the lines written for them. There is nothing brave about a Republican doing what a Democrat and/or the media want them to. It's the easy way. </p><p>It would have been more convincing if Costner had said \"I wore it because my agent thought it would be a good PR move.\"</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

There are an <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/teacher-arrested-four-girls\" target=\"_blank\">abnormal amount of stories</a> like that. Granted, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/teacher-arrested-molesting-seven-students\" target=\"_blank\">more than zero</a> is an abnormal amount.  No, this is a ten-year-old student who, allegedly, groped a teacher. And the teacher is pressing charges. Criminal charges. Against a ten-year-old.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"9f295\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32073693&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>The content created by <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/10-year-old-student-hugged-school-counselor-now-facing-charges-accused-rcna56355\" target=\"_blank\">NBC News</a> is as follows. A Florida school counselor was visiting  Holly Hill School. A ten-year-old student asked to give her a hug. The counselor turned sideways to give a side hug, and while the child put one arm around her shoulder he used his other hand to reach out and grab her left breast. She removed the hand from her breast and walked away.</p><p>Police were called because of this alleged misdemeanor. The 10-year-old, we'll call him Little Timmy, received a ten-day suspension from school and is facing a charge of misdemeanor battery. Little Timmy's parents deny the allegations, as does Little Timmy. Little Timmy's parents and their lawyers are fighting the charge.</p><p>Is it possible that Little Timmy did, in fact, grab the boobie? </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"63dea\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32073718&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>Yes. And let me be the first to tell you, grabbing a boobie without permission is bad. It's inappropriate. Had Little Timmy grabbed the boobie, consequences are warranted. AGE APPROPRIATE consequences. A school meeting with his parents. Possibly making Little Timmy write \"I will not grab boobies without permission\" 100 times.</p><p>Charging the TEN-YEAR-OLD with a misdemeanor is a bit much. If I were to guess, the counselor has purple hair, claims to smash the patriarchy, and voted for Charlie Crist last Tuesday. </p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

It's also dangerous.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shop-teacher-school-board\" target=\"_blank\">Those critics say things like</a> \"we as adults are supposed to protect the children,\" \"no normal person in their right mind would dress up like that and go teach kids,\" and \"dude...what the f*ckity f*cking f*ck?\"</p><p>The complaints went to the Halton District School Board. <a href=\"https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-ontario-school-board-determines-busty-biological-male-teacher-allowed-to-wear-fetish-props-to-school\" target=\"_blank\">The Post Millennial reports</a> board members ruled against the concerns of parents and sided with equality and inclusion. If wearing size HHH breastists makes Kayla say \"damn, I feel like a woman,\" she can continue living her best life. </p><blockquote>It is important to recognize the impact that dress code policies can have on members of the transgender community.

What Fetterman accomplished was running against a horrible statewide GOP candidate who was being dragged down by a worse statewide GOP candidate. Pennslyvania had to choose between a guy who is half a vegetable and Dr. Oz. They chose the half a vegetable who looks like he can stand to eat more of them.</p><p>Is the lack of ability to communicate the one trait leftists look for in the presidential candidates?

Dave Chappelle, a comedian, is the best to ever do it. And the alleged \"comedy\" writers for SNL are BOYCOTTING THE COMEDY SHOW they write for because Chappelle is hosting.\n</p><p>\n\tLet that one percolate in your noggin as I quote the \n\t<a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2022/11/09/snl-writers-boycott-over-dave-chappelle-hosting-the-show/\" target=\"_blank\">New York Post</a>:\n</p><blockquote>\n\tWe\u2019re told that some staff writers are so furious that the comedy superstar \u2014 who has made transphobic and homophobic jokes \u2014 has been chosen to helm the iconic show that they\u2019re sitting out the episode.\n</blockquote><blockquote>\n\t\u201cThey\u2019re not going to do the show,\u201d an insider told Page Six. \u201cBut none of the actors are boycotting.\u201d\n</blockquote><p>\n\tWe don't have to recap <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/search/?q=dave+chappelle\" target=\"_blank\">all the Chappelle \"controversy\"</a> over the past few years to explain how we got to this point.

Chappelle reps told the paper there was nothing to suggest there was a boycott when they attended the writers' meeting. <em>New York Post</em> is also who reported that <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-snl-host-outrage\" target=\"_blank\">there were boycotts over Elon Musk</a> when he was a host, due to Musk having different opinions than everyone who works on SNL.</p><p>The current comedy writers suck pretty hard at writing comedy. If the boycott is true and if I'm Dave Chappelle, I'm saying \"f*ck it, I'll write it myself.\"</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"94d0b\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32071726&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>It's astounding when you think about it. We're not talking about the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-snl-outrage\" target=\"_blank\">proverbial three idiots on Twitter with the same dumb opinion</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-protesters\" target=\"_blank\">collection of freaks who protest outside of his shows</a>. We're talking about COMEDY WRITERS working for (what used to be) a legendary comedy show boycotting because they are unhappy with a COMEDIAN'S jokes. </p><p>And not any comedian. It's not like they're boycotting someone Kenan Thompson saw at an open mic night tha he wants to give a big break to. They a boycotting a comedian many consider to be THE GOAT. That's funnier than any joke SNL writers will come up with.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
