Both of the previous CD recordings of Zoroastre, conducted by Sigiswald Kuijken and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/mar/07/classicalmusicandopera.artsfeatures6">William Christie</a>, used that 1756 score, but Alexis Kossenko opts for the original, in which three of the five acts are entirely different from the later version.</p><p>The reasons Rameau revised his opera so drastically were clear enough. The 1749 premiere had been badly received, condemned by the critics and artistic circles in Paris, who pronounced it to be like the composer himself: “<em>long, sec, noir et dur”</em> (long, dry, dark and difficult). For an audience expecting stage works to be based upon familiar classical or medieval sources, the subject matter of Zoroastre would have been disconcerting, too, for this was a libretto based upon Persian mythology, set in what is now Afghanistan, and larded with masonic ideas and imagery, most of which disappeared in the revision.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/10/rameau-zoroastre-review-alexis-kossenko">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Cirque d’Hiver Bouglione, Paris<br /></strong>He has ditched the dancers but not the theatricality in this showcase for new album Redcar Les Adorables Étoiles</p><p>An ethereal voice booms from above, echoing down over Paris’s Cirque d’Hiver: “Redcar, come to me baby.” Stationed in the middle of a ring-shaped stage, Christine and the Queens – real name Héloïse Letissier – is performing in a 19th-century circus lined with gilded horses and plush velvet curtains, on a stage originally designed for acrobats and clowns. In place of a trapeze, a blue wire moon dangles from an invisible rope, carefully operated by a black-clad figure in a plague mask. A tangled junk-yard of kitschy Christmas lights, helium birthday balloons, traffic cones, red warning tape, and medieval tapestries spill down the steep, graduated steps. Placed next to the minimal neon lights and slick, meticulous choreography that characterised the French artist’s earlier tours – for 2016’s English language debut <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/03/christine-and-the-queens-chaleur-humaine">Chaleur Humaine</a> and 2018’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/20/christine-and-the-queens-chris-album-review">Chris</a> – this peculiar, slightly ramshackle production feels like a rejection of everything Letissier has done to this point. Accordingly, a bright red billboard outside the venue bears a statement of intent: pop music is dead, long live theatre.</p><p>A showcase for Letissier’s new album <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/10/christine-and-the-queens-redcar-les-adorables-etoiles-review-clouds-of-sorrow-from-the-artists-new-persona">Redcar Les Adorables Étoiles</a>, the setlist is dominated by new material, which itself feels like a backdrop to tonight’s highly theatrical, concept-heavy staging. Single-handedly holding court in this one-performer show, Letissier has an intensity throughout that veers from anger to comedy; he bickers with stage props and briefly pauses the show to welcome a stunned punter back to their seat. Redcar Les Adorables Étoiles in recorded form feels like a slightly obtuse knight’s tale, but performed it feels more like watching strange, postmodern Shakespeare, Letissier a confused, lost figure stuck between playing the jester and disconnecting from his audience completely.</p><p>Christine and the Queens performs Redcar at the Southbank Centre on 22 November</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/10/christine-and-the-queens-review-redcar-les-adorables-etoiles">Continue reading...</a>

I’ve very occasionally booed shows I hated, and I want to be free to do so again if I choose. Not everything on the opera, or any other stage, has always got to be cheered politely or given the reflexive standing ovations that seem ever more common. Booing and whistling at the opera or theatre can sometimes be healthy and necessary protest. It is actually a lot more common than you may think, especially on first nights, especially in continental Europe.

It was repeated and mean-spirited barracking during a touching and plaintive aria about the loss of a father. Most disturbingly of all, it was the heckling of a child. It took place during act one of Handel’s opera Alcina, to a boy character, Oberto. Covent Garden’s production gives Oberto a prominent and poignant prominence. The target was Malakai M Bayoh, a 12-year-old boy soprano who is alternating the role with another young singer during the six performances scheduled by the Royal Opera this month.</p><p>Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/10/booed-opera-young-black-soprano">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Exclusive: Gamma-ray burst from colliding stars unexpectedly gave way to day-long sight of hypermassive body</p><p>An “overweight” neutron star has been observed by astronomers, who say the mysterious object confounds astronomical theories.</p><p>The hypermassive star was produced by the merger of two smaller neutron stars. Normally such collisions result in neutron stars so massive that they collapse into a black hole almost instantaneously under their own gravity. But the latest observations revealed the monster star hovering in view for more than a day before it faded out of sight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/nov/10/overweight-neutron-star-defies-a-black-hole-theory-say-astronomers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The star’s comeback is as bland and cloying as any other low-budget festive romance but serves as a strong reminder of her confident screen presence</p><p>The bait-y allure of a <em>real</em> Lindsay Lohan comeback has been tied more to the headline than the small print, the troubled star’s first lead role in more than a decade mattering more than what it’s actually in. Because for many of us of a certain age and a certain pop culture investment, the enthusiastically publicised ups and mostly downs of her life have given us a deep-rooted desire to see her succeed, working against a negative tabloid and industry-at-large perception and also working against her worst self.</p><p>The textbook descent from precocious pre-pubescent to twentysomething tearaway inevitably overshadowed the undeniable fact that Lohan was, at her height, a winning presence, a natural who held her own at a young age against some of the greats. Her return to the screen is both minor and major; minor in that it’s in a rote Hallmark-adjacent Christmas movie and major because it will be available on Netflix, where it will probably be a substantial hit for an audience eager for a) festive fluff and b) festive fluff starring Lindsay Lohan.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/10/falling-for-christmas-review-lindsay-lohan-netflix-movie">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An expedition to find Wallace’s giant bee in the wild led to its ‘rediscovery’ in Indonesia’s Maluku islands</p><p>A “flying bulldog” is how conservation photographer Clay Bolt described it, while local people call it <em>raja </em><em>ofu</em>, or the king of bees. <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/4410/21426160">Wallace’s giant bee</a> (<em>Megachile pluto</em>) is certainly a bee-hemoth. The world’s largest species of bee, it can grow to four times the size of a honeybee, with a wingspan of 64mm (2.5in). Such a giant should be hard to lose, but the incredibly rare bee, native to a cluster of Indonesian islands, was feared extinct for nearly 40 years, until Bolt and his colleagues “rediscovered” it in 2019. </p><p>The naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, a contemporary of Charles Darwin, collected the first known sample of the bee in 1858 while exploring Bacan, one of northern Indonesia’s Maluku (Moluccas) islands. Wallace collected a single female of the species, and noted it as “a large, black wasp-like insect, with immense jaws like a stag-beetle”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/10/lost-and-found-indonesian-giant-bee-feared-extinct-ebay-aoe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The director’s movies provided an intense emotive soundtrack to teenagers’ lives. A new box set collects tracks from his best-loved films, by artists such as Simple Minds, the Smiths and OMD</p><p>It was clear just how important music was to John Hughes’s cinematic vision of teenage life when The Breakfast Club, his high-school detention drama, was released in 1985. As the film ended with its five principals – “a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal” – having reached mutual understanding, the voice of Simple Minds’ Jim Kerr crooned: “Won’t you come see about me?”</p><p>The writers of Don’t You (Forget About Me), Keith Forsey and Steve Schiff, were trying to emulate the rhythm of Our Lips Are Sealed, by the Go-Go’s, and the song was inspired by a conversation in the film between Anthony Michael Hall (“brain”) and Judd Nelson (“criminal”). “When they were away from everybody else, the two of them actually recognised each other,” Forsey says now. “It reminded me of when I was going to school. If you were in the school playground, the bad guys would be pretty bad to you, but if you met them at the bus stop in the morning, there was some bonding there. That was the reason I came up with Don’t You (Forget About Me). It was: don’t forget, when we’re back in the classroom, you’re not just a bad guy and we’ve got other things in common.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/10/the-power-of-music-in-john-hughes-films-when-you-hear-those-songs-you-see-those-moments">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Friends star has spoken out about not getting pregnant in an era when her body was deemed a perfect match for social expectations of femininity</p><p>Jennifer Aniston has spoken for the first time about trying to get pregnant, which is significant for the kind of people who speculate about celebrities and their fertility – which in the late 90s and through the 00s was roughly everybody – because the exact cause of Aniston’s child-free life has been puzzling them for years. “It was really hard,” she told <a href="https://www.allure.com/story/jennifer-aniston-ivf-fertility-struggles">Allure</a> magazine. “I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would’ve given anything if someone had said to me, ‘Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favour.’ You just don’t think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.”</p><p>The undisputed main star of Friends and, circa 2003, the highest-paid female TV actor in the world, has always been a template for the feminine ideal. I remember an American columnist in the very early years of Friends explaining her appeal thus: “She knows, and everyone knows she knows, she has great hair.” It was such a peculiar formulation that it lodged in my mind, which was fortunate, because it was the mid-90s, so it’s not on Google. The hair, not too long (attention-seeking), nor too short (feminist/independent), not too blond (conventional) or too dark (vampy), not too shiny (airhead) nor in any way dull (frigid), was the perfect, man-pleasing hair for the late 20th-century woman; but the fact that she was self-aware, hair-wise, was important too, because it was cool in those days to be <em>a little bit </em>feminist.</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/10/jennifer-aniston-fertility-obsession-ivf">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As long as the Democrats wage war on Trump, they avoid the more important work of building a New Deal-style majority</p><p>America’s midterm elections proved that the era of Donald Trump is passing.

It nearly allowed Bernie Sanders to break through as presidential candidate in 2016 and 2020; if Sanders failed while Trump succeeded, it was more because of Republican disorganization than because their complaints against both parties were different (though their solutions were).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/10/democrats-move-past-donald-trump-new-deal">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Because Music)<br /></strong>Breakup songs and wistful melodies pepper this uneven new release from Héloïse Letissier, who wrote and recorded it over just two weeks</p><p>In 2016, Christine and the Queens appeared on British TV for the first time. It was, by common consent, one of the great music television debuts: an exquisitely choreographed, effortlessly executed performance of breakthrough hit Tilted that unexpectedly surged into a cover of I Feel for You, in tribute to its recently deceased author, Prince. Even when the artist reemerged as Chris on 2018’s album of the same name, the vision remained immaculate. It all seemed incredibly cool and expertly done, the work of a hugely talented artist in complete control.</p><p>It makes for a striking and slightly troubling contrast with the arrival of Christine and the Queens’ third album, Redcar les Adorables Étoiles. It seems to have been beset by disagreements between artist and record label, which have spilled on to social media. A certain confusion surrounds the whole enterprise, which involves the introduction of a new persona, Redcar. Redcar is a masculine figure – the artist at the centre of Christine and the Queens, Héloïse Letissier, recently came out as a trans man – named after the red vehicles that began to take on significance for him in the wake of his mother’s sudden death in 2019. And there, all attempts at explication flounder. Like blockbuster movies, the most successful pop personae can be summarised with a neat one-line pitch. Ziggy Stardust: gay alien pop star. The Fly: the diametric opposite of earnest old Bono. Sasha Fierce: like Beyoncé, only sexier and more aggressive.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/10/christine-and-the-queens-redcar-les-adorables-etoiles-review-clouds-of-sorrow-from-the-artists-new-persona">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Indian cricket shapes the world game yet they have now gone 11 years without a trophy as big game misjudgments continue to cost them</p><p>Indian cricket should be dominating world cricket. By bank balance it already is: the last Indian Premier League deal went for more than US$6bn, the season will soon expand to 94 matches, its timeframe will eat up more of the southern season, pushing earlier into March and perhaps even February. Its franchises have already taken January by buying up new leagues in South Africa and the United Arab Emirates, the same organisations are eyeing up The Hundred in England and the Big Bash in Australia should private investment be invited, and as salary caps increase they will soon be able to pay players amounts that even the richest national boards cannot match.</p><p>For all of that, hegemony on the field has not yet been established. Logic suggests that it will: the success of the Indian Premier League means that scouts are now touring their own vast country, searching for new talent to be developed, while more players in lower competitions give their all to chase the possibility of a cricket career with so many more jobs available. The players selected are put into high-level professional environments, training with some of the best coaches and teammates in the world. Every advance made by a local player benefits the Indian national setup.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/10/t20-indian-cricket-world-domination-eludes-again">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Eating one is such a fiddly, intense process that you can’t think about anything else. But the season’s nearly done, more’s the pity</p><p>Amid the mind-cluttering chaos of political parties ripping themselves apart like cannibal rats in a barrel, dictators threatening nuclear war, climate catastrophe and so on, we could all do with something to quieten the bad thoughts. Recently, I found mine: a globe artichoke. It had been a while since I’d been served one in the classic style, with jugs of Dijon-bonded vinaigrette. In the 1970s, these were a staple of my mother’s fancier dinner parties; a marker of a certain sophistication, which took its lead from France, where they recognised the edible possibilities of a humble thistle.</p><p>What I had forgotten was just how blissfully engrossing the process of eating one can be. Each thick, olive-green petal must be pulled from its sticking place, dipped into the dressing, before the business end is dragged over the teeth to get at the mother lode. Finally, you must dispose of that leaf, and start again. Repeat, dozens of times. Of course, it’s delicious. But more importantly, it’s impossible to think about anything else other than the job at hand while eating one. The profound comfort of that is not to be underestimated.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/nov/10/stressed-out-by-all-this-global-catastrophe-try-a-globe-artichoke-jay-rayner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Red Roses face a defining 80 minutes for their all-conquering vision while New Zealand women relish arrival on biggest stage </p><p>Not since Martin Johnson hoisted the Webb Ellis Cup into the Sydney sky in 2003 has an English rugby union team been as tantalisingly close to World Cup glory in the southern hemisphere. If the Red Roses can join a truly exclusive club it would be a similarly symbolic moment and unquestionably place them among the finest women’s sides of all time.</p><p>Before all those debates can begin, though, there is still a game to be won. In September the head coach, Simon Middleton, acknowledged there could be no excuses in New Zealand for a squad who have benefited from full-time contracts for a longer period than any of their rivals. For all the Black Ferns’ rapid improvement, England have now won 30 Tests on the spin. Hence Middleton’s bullish tone on a sunny day in Bagshot a little over seven weeks ago: “We’ve got to win it. This is the best prepared squad with the best strength in depth we’ve ever had.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/10/history-beckons-for-red-roses-and-new-zealand-in-game-changing-womens-rugby-world-cup-finale">Continue reading...</a>

Singer and actor who found fame as a child star with a contagiously commercial mix of pop-rap and ballads that sold in the millions<p>“Fame at a young age is often more of a curse than a blessing, and surviving it is not easy,” said the veteran songwriter Diane Warren after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/05/aaron-carter-singer-and-brother-of-backstreet-boys-nick-dies-aged-34" title="">news broke of the death of Aaron Carter</a>. Carter, who has been found dead at his home, aged 34, was a true child prodigy, beginning his musical career when he was seven. The first two singles from his 1997 debut album (released a few days before his 10th birthday), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7ZUmib1Mrk" title="">Crush on You</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsiVH3D2ghA" title="">Crazy Little Party Girl</a>, both became Top 10 hits in the UK. The album reached No 12 in the UK, and sold 100,000 copies in the US.</p><p>Carter’s success became rocket-assisted with the arrival in 2000 of his second album, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0p3jn7ODuc" title="">Aaron’s Party (Come Get It)</a>, a contagiously commercial batch of songs including the title track, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaL9VrQOP0E" title="">I Want Candy</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfhhWA9GF0M" title="">That’s How I Beat Shaq</a>. These scored valuable exposure on the Nickelodeon and Disney channels, powering the album to 3m sales in the US. Opening slots for shows by the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears sent Carter’s profile soaring, and in 2001 he began to branch into acting, appearing in the Disney Channel comedy series Lizzie McGuire and taking the role of JoJo the Who in Seussical, a Broadway musical.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/10/aaron-carter-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Moscow orders troops to leave Ukraine’s southern city of Kherson in humiliating retreat; Ukraine responds with caution</p><p><strong>There have been diverging reactions to Russia’s announcement on Wednesday that it will withdraw its troops from the right bank of Kherson region - in what would be another defeat for its forces.</strong></p><p><strong>On Wednesday the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu ordered troops to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/09/russians-destroy-dnieper-bridges-to-slow-ukraine-advance-on-kherson">leave Ukraine’s southern city of Kherson</a>,</strong> the only regional capital Moscow had captured since the invasion began. The announcement marks one of Russia’s most significant retreats and a potential turning point in the war. General <strong>Sergei Surovikin</strong>, in overall command of the war, called it a “very difficult decision”.</p><p><strong>While Russia did not formally declare it was abandoning Kherson, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/09/ukraine-brigade-russia-retreat-kherson-frontline">all signs point to a Moscow retreat</a>. </strong>“Kherson cannot be fully supplied and function,” Surovikin said. “The decision to defend on the left bank of the Dnipro is not easy, at the same time we will save the lives of our military.” Russia had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/09/as-russia-tries-to-dig-in-ukraines-challenge-will-be-to-repeat-its-victory-in-kherson">preparing its exit for the last month,</a> moving command and control across the river.</p><p>Ukrainian victory in Kherson will be a <strong>significant blow to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin,</strong> only weeks after a high-profile ceremony in Moscow in which he announced the “forever” annexation of the Kherson region along with three other regions.</p><p><strong>Ukraine</strong> <strong>reacted with caution, saying some Russian forces were still in Kherson</strong> and additional Russian manpower was being sent. “Until the Ukrainian flag is flying over Kherson, it makes no sense to talk about a Russian withdrawal,” said <strong>Mykhailo Podolyak</strong>, a senior adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.</p><p><strong>Joe Biden said Russia’s withdrawal of troops from Kherson was “evidence” that its military had “real problems”. </strong>During a White House press conference on Wednesday, the US president said he “knew for some time” it would happen.</p><p>Russia’s loss of Kherson’s west bank will likely prevent its forces from achieving their strategic aspiration of a land bridge reaching Odesa, according to the <strong>UK Ministry of Defence. </strong>“With limited crossing points, Russian forces will be vulnerable in crossing the Dnipro River,” the latest British intelligence report reads.</p><p><strong>The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Russia’s retreat was “part of an overall pattern” demonstrating that Moscow “has absolutely lost the momentum”</strong>. “But we should not underestimate Russia, they still have capabilities,” he told Sky News. “We have seen the drones, we have seen the missile attacks. It shows that Russia can still inflict a lot of damage.”</p><p>Russia’s decision to withdraw troops from near the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson is a positive step, Turkish President <strong>Recep Tayyip Erdoğan</strong> said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/10/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-260-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>

## England’s mental health care lacks money, yes – but it also lacks compassion | Jay Watts

<p>A series of scandals should focus minds on the punitive conditions far too many patients are confined in</p><p>We have made great progress in England when it comes to acceptance and knowledge around mental health issues. But have our basic services also improved in tandem? We are told that clinical approaches to mental health are getting better: that the coercive control of the asylum era is over, heralding care in the community; that the blossoming of interest in wellbeing means psychiatric care is no longer the second-class citizen of medicine. But some facts, unfortunately, tell a more harrowing story, reflecting a problem as much with ideology as funding.</p><p>In the past few months, scandal after scandal has shone a light on the appalling state of mental health inpatient care (meaning those who have to stay at least one night). First, we had a Panorama investigation into the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-63095331">Edenfield Centre</a>, a secure psychiatric hospital run by the NHS in Manchester, which alleged that vulnerable patients were ridiculed and inappropriately restrained. Then a <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/news-campaigns/news/mind-responds-to-undercover-documentary-exposing-failings-on-essex-nhs-mental-health-wards/">Dispatches undercover investigation</a> showed wards in Essex where patients appeared to have been cruelly treated, despite repeated inquiries into a series of <a href="https://www.essexlive.news/news/essex-news/essex-partnership-university-hospital-trust-5535605">suicides between 2004 and 2015</a>, hauntingly represented in the ongoing agony of interviewed family members.

Sign up here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Hello! Alexi is away this week so I am once again filling in with the week’s pod recommendations.<br /><br />This week saw the release of If Books Could Kill, a new show from Michael Hobbes, formerly of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/15/ok-but-hear-me-out-the-five-best-podcasts-to-change-your-mind">You’re Wrong About</a>, and <a href="https://www.fivefourpod.com/">5-4’s</a> Peter Shamshiri. The show digs into “airport bestsellers that captured our hearts and ruined our minds”. The first episode is all about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/15/freakonomics-10-years-on-stephen-dubner-steven-levitt-interview">Freakonomics</a>, and whether the data in the hit 2005 book definitely supports the trends – on crime, race, and more – it claims to.<br /><br />It’s not Hobbes’s first foray into the “debunking culture” pod subgenre; as well as You’re Wrong About, he also hosts <a href="https://www.maintenancephase.com/">Maintenance Phase</a>, on wellness-themed misinformation. It is, personally, one of my favourite types of audio series; the British “tech pessimist” podcast <a href="https://www.trashfuture.co.uk/">Trashfuture</a> is a frequent go-to for tales of startup-themed miscreancy and eccentricity.<br /><br />What do I like about these podcasts so much? As well as appealing to the cynical (hi!), I think it’s the fact that the “debunking culture” pods are often actually where much podcast comedy occurs, melding analysis with chat, and politics with real life. However, falling firmly down a rabbit hole of any kind – even if you’re far from a conspiracy theorist – is always a risk, so I’m happy that If Books Could Kill has gone for a weekly release schedule rather than putting out a series all in one go. Books, gladly, cannot kill – and neither can debunking podcasts – but they can certainly overwhelm your brain if you binge them. <br /><br />Read on for a varied set of picks this week – including a new series on Bin Laden’s rise to infamy – and five of the best podcasts to get you feeling greenfingered and in touch with nature.<br /><br /><em><strong>Hannah J Davies</strong><br />Deputy editor, newsletters</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/10/hear-here-podcast-bin-laden-files">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From electric power to the steam locomotive, the brilliant arrogance of Victorian invention</p><p>As he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/sep/30/tesla-optimus-humanoid-robot-elon-musk-ai-day" title="">unveiled</a> Tesla’s new humanoid robot, Optimus, this September, Elon Musk spoke with characteristic flamboyance about the device’s potential. “This means a future of abundance,” he declared. “A future where there is no poverty … It really is a fundamental transformation of civilisation as we know it.” Perhaps deliberately, he was echoing the tone of his company’s namesake, Nikola Tesla, who in the 1890s was making similarly bold claims about his own work-in-progress. With his new system of wireless telegraphy, Tesla insisted, battleships would be controlled remotely, meaning that pretty soon “war would be abolished” and there would be a “revolution in the politics of the whole world”.</p><p>How the Victorians Took Us to the Moon argues that this triumphalist view of the future, so much the norm among Tesla’s contemporaries, led directly to the advances that enabled the moon landings, the technological present we now inhabit and the way we still think about the future today. It rattles thrillingly through such developments as the Transatlantic telegraph cable, the steam locomotive and electric power and recalls the excitable predictions of the fiction of the time: “In the year 2000 imagined in John Jacob Astor’s A Journey in Other Worlds, electricity was ubiquitous … Everyone had a windmill on their roof.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/10/how-the-victorians-took-us-to-the-moon-by-iwan-rhys-morus-review-sciences-showmen">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Peter Greenaway’s arch tale of sexual and political manipulation has not lost its power to bewilder and beguile</p><p>After 40 years, here is a re-release of a classic product of the British Film Institute and Channel 4, in the era when they high-mindedly sponsored non-commercial artistry. If anything, Peter Greenaway’s film looks more brilliant, more uncompromisingly cerebral and more exasperating than ever. Watching it again, I found myself thinking of Congreve, Dangerous Liaisons and The Wicker Man.</p><p>This was Greenaway’s breakthrough; it startled and entranced British audiences and European audiences even more so, with its rich, weird mix of luscious costumes and theatricality, emotionless line-readings, austerely inert staging, opaque plotting, mad elegance and mysterious eroticism. (It’s a distant cousin to the “chateau artporn” of the previous decade.) And all with Michael Nyman’s score chugging relentlessly away, like a violin bow sawing into your skull.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/10/the-draughtsmans-contract-review-cerebral-intrigue-still-compels-peter-greenaway">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Canadian polymath’s lush illustrations have long combined innocence with menace. But now, in traumatic times, he wants to put ‘something beautiful out there’</p><p>The Canadian artist Marcel Dzama cannot stay in one lane. While studying art at the University of Manitoba in the mid-1990s, he played in bands, and lots of them. Among others, there was Professor Moriarty for heavy rock, Tumbleweed for country music and Danceatron for, well, dance music. That freewheeling spirit has continued throughout the 48-year-old’s career. Best known for his figurative drawings, Dzama also makes dioramas, puppets, costumes, stage designs, films, songs, fanzines and sculptures. He has collaborated with Spike Jonze, Maurice Sendak, Beck, Kim Gordon, Raymond Pettibon, Bob Dylan and the New York City Ballet. It’s a lot.</p><p>“I keep really bad hours,” he says blearily from his seaside house in Long Island, having just woken up. “I stayed up till five last night, finishing a new painting.” He has a charmingly gentle, unworldly quality. Being so prolific means that he needs reminding of what he’s done. “The titles I forget,” he apologises. “I’ll blame my memory on the pandemic.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/nov/10/marcel-dzama-child-of-midnight-exhibition">Continue reading...</a>

<p>O’Neal is the cherub-faced, ultra-cool getaway driver in this re-release of Walter Hill’s thrillingly cynical LA pulp noir </p><p>Walter Hill’s LA pulp-noir thriller from 1978 is re-released in cinemas, a film to show you that it isn’t hitmen who need the glacial calm of the samurai; it’s getaway drivers, and The Driver is bookended with two rock’n’roll car chases. This was Hill’s second car-chase movie, after his screenplay for The Getaway from 1972, adapted by him from the Jim Thompson novel and directed by Sam Peckinpah. The Driver is his own lean, mean original script.</p><p>Ryan O’Neal stars, with his face of outrageous 1970s pulchritude (as Jacqueline Bisset says to him in The Thief Who Came to Dinner: “You’re too beautiful to be any good.” – “Any good at what?” – “What else is there?”) He is a getaway driver, the best in the business and, in time-honoured fashion he is ultra-cool, composed, affectless but radiating understated and slightly martyred contempt for other criminals’ lack of professionalism. Ryan Gosling picked up on this for his wheelman in Nicolas Winding Refn’s Drive. O’Neal doesn’t have the worldly cragginess of Steve McQueen in Bullitt or The Getaway, and is more cherubic, a look to which Edgar Wright paid homage in Baby Driver from 2017.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/10/the-driver-review-ryan-oneal-gets-away-with-it-in-car-chase-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Return of the sketch comedy show for the first time since 2016 demonstrates the ever-diminishing returns of political skits</p><p>The Inside Amy Schumer skit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMVJcwmF5M">“Dr Congress”</a> depicts a recognizable hell: the comedian in a sterile examining room, seeking gynecological care from a doctor but instead met with four condescending, clueless, puritanical men. Her medical care is actually at the hands of politicians, members of the all-male, decidedly unscientific “House committee on women’s health.”</p><p>The sketch, from the show’s fourth season, was released in April 2016. But watching it earlier this month, I mistook it as recent, a bit from the new season of Inside Amy Schumer on Paramount+, the show’s first since it went on hiatus half a year before Trump’s election. That’s in part because the sketch’s grotesque satire is only degrees removed from our current reality – especially absent Roe v Wade, unscientific committees of politicians are now making medical decisions for women across the country. (As Pennsylvania Senate candidate Dr Oz <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/26/pennsylvania-senate-debate-mehmet-oz-john-fetterman">put it in a recent debate</a>: decisions over abortion should be between women, doctors and “local political leaders”.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/10/inside-amy-schumer-topical-comedy-troubles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A wave of bestselling authors claim that global affairs are still ultimately governed by the immutable facts of geography – mountains, oceans, rivers, resources. But the world has changed more than they realise</p><p>Russia’s war in Ukraine has involved many surprises. The largest, however, is that it happened at all. Last year, Russia was at peace and enmeshed in a complex global economy. Would it really sever trade ties – and threaten nuclear war – just to expand its already vast territory? Despite the many warnings, including from Vladimir Putin himself, the invasion still came as a shock.</p><p>But it wasn’t a shock to the journalist Tim Marshall. On the first page of his 2015 blockbuster book, <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/prisoners-of-geography-9781783962433" title="">Prisoners of Geography</a>, Marshall invited readers to contemplate Russia’s topography. A ring of mountains and ice surrounds it. Its border with China is protected by mountain ranges, and it is separated from Iran and Turkey by the Caucusus. Between Russia and western Europe stand the Balkans, Carpathians and Alps, which form another wall. Or, they nearly do. To the north of those mountains, a flat corridor – the Great European Plain – connects Russia to its well-armed western neighbours via Ukraine and Poland.

<p>How did a man who’s most at home in the wilderness end up topping the Strictly leaderboard? The wildlife cameraman turned TV presenter talks about his dance partner Jowita, his childhood in Sudan and his life today as ‘the only black person in 150 miles’</p><p>For a while, Hamza Yassin looked set to be a dentist, but the textbooks put him off. His older brother was studying for the profession – they are from a family of doctors and dentists – and he showed Yassin the book. “It was about three inches thick,” he says. “Because of my dyslexia, I was like: there is no way I’m learning all of that.” Dentistry’s loss is the nation’s gain. Yassin followed his passion: he wanted to work with animals and became a wildlife cameraman and TV presenter (he now works on Countryfile and the preschooler CBeebies show Let’s Go for a Walk). Now he’s a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing – one of the series’ most joyful ever.</p><p>Have I ever met anyone as gentle and upbeat as Yassin? I’m not sure. He laughs as he describes arriving in London for his Strictly adventure, saying good morning to people on the street, as he would at home, and them blanking him or looking alarmed. His most-used word seems to be “beautiful”, which he uses to describe everything from the very concept of Strictly and his relationship with his professional dance partner, Jowita Przystal, to his childhood home in Sudan, the community in his remote Scottish village, and the animals he waits patiently to film.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/10/id-rather-face-a-polar-bear-than-step-on-the-dancefloor-strictlys-hamza-yassin-on-salsa-scotland-and-singledom">Continue reading...</a>
