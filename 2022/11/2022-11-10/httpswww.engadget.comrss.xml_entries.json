An on-again-off-again runner. I\u2019ve flirted with boxing. Oh, and I write. Obviously.</p><p>Now I\u2019ve added photography to the list. I explored it a bit back in high school and college, but had only picked up a camera (that wasn\u2019t built into my phone) outside of work a handful of times since.

My first photography experiences were with film. Sure, it\u2019s been a long time since I last used a film camera, but at least I have some level of comfort there. Unlike most digital cameras, Fujifilm\u2019s X series mimics the look and feel of a 35mm film camera. There are dedicated dials for shutter speed and exposure compensation, and many of Fuji\u2019s first-party lenses have physical aperture rings. If I had sprung for the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-16-fujifilm-x-t3-review.html\">X-T3</a> I\u2019d have even gotten a dedicated ISO dial. But there are two programmable dials that can be mapped to control ISO and aperture, even if you\u2019re using a lens without an aperture ring.</p><p>This makes the X-T30 far more tactile and satisfying than other digital cameras I\u2019ve used, whereas I would usually just put them in aperture priority and forget about it. Without a PASM dial (Program, Aperture priority, Shutter priority and Manual) as a crutch, I\u2019ve been forced to learn the camera\u2019s various options inside and out. I also have to think more carefully and critically about each exposure. Yes, you can essentially put the X-T30 in shutter or aperture priority mode by changing certain settings to auto, but you can\u2019t just turn a dial and be done with it.</p><figure><img alt=\"Fujifilm X-T30 sample shots\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/57cc3010-5ac5-11ed-a7f6-3344e7b0dd42\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Terrence O'Brien</div></figure><p>The other big thing for me is the film simulations. Fuji cameras have a built in set of profiles that are supposed to mimic particular film stock. Think of them kind of like Instagram filters, but less terrible. Astia is tuned for portraits, Velvia is perfect for landscapes, Eterna gives you that low-contrast cinematic look, and so on.</p><p>And that\u2019s just scratching the surface: You can tweak the settings further to fine-tune your straight-out-of-camera (SOOC) JPGs to achieve various styles and approximations of other films. There\u2019s even a whole little Fujifilm subculture dedicated to \u201cfilm recipes\u201d that aim to capture the general vibe, if not the look of many classic film stocks. One of the best resources for this is <a href=\"https://fujixweekly.com/\">Fuji X Weekly</a>, where Ritchie Roesch shares and shows off various recipes to try and recreate things like Kodak\u2019s <a href=\"https://fujixweekly.com/2021/08/17/fujifilm-x-t3-x-t30-film-simulation-recipe-kodak-portra-400-v2/\">Portra 400</a> or <a href=\"https://fujixweekly.com/2020/04/24/not-my-fujifilm-x-t30-ilford-delta-push-process-film-simulation-recipe/\">Ilford Delta</a>.</p><section><img alt=\"Fujifilm X-T30 sample shots\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/57caf790-5ac5-11ed-afed-21d53e7fa788\" /></section><p>Because I\u2019m someone who likes to obsess over tiny details and tweak things, this is perfect for me. When I first discovered Fuji X Weekly I spent several days going through the recipes that were <a href=\"https://fujixweekly.com/fujifilm-x-trans-iv-recipes/\">compatible with my particular camera</a> (and some that weren\u2019t), punching in the settings and taking test photos, saving my favorites to Evernote for easy recall. Fuji makes it simple to load up to seven of these presets with the Q menu, so I can essentially go out with seven different \u201cfilms\u201d loaded in my camera and switch between them as the situation dictates.</p><p>What I like most about this setup is that I can just go out and shoot, and come back with great looking photos that don\u2019t need any editing. I can decide in the moment: Would this be better with a warmer color palette? Should I be turning up the saturation here? How would this scene look in high-contrast black and white? And I don\u2019t need to do a lot of menu diving to test different looks out.</p><figure><img alt=\"Fujifilm X-T30 sample shots\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/57cb6cc0-5ac5-11ed-adff-17b1cfbd5e35\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Terrence O'Brien</div></figure><p>I always shoot in RAW + JPG, in case I change my mind later or if something doesn\u2019t come out quite how I wanted. But being able to basically see the finished product and focus on actually composing photos, as opposed to spending even more time sitting at a laptop is great. It\u2019s exactly what I need in a hobby: less staring at a computer screen.</p><p>Without getting absurd and gimmicky \u2013 artificially limiting how many pictures I can take or using only one preset for at least 24 shots in a row \u2013 this feels about as close to shooting film as I\u2019m gonna get on a digital camera. And while, yes, I know I could always just go back to shooting on film, I\u2019d really rather not. I like many of the modern conveniences afforded by a digital camera. Plus, 35mm film and quality development services have gotten <em>quite</em> expensive. Even expired rolls of lower-end stock can fetch a decent price on Craigslist.</p><section><img alt=\"Fujifim X-T30 sample shot\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/56c2e410-5b8e-11ed-b1fe-2a3fad99da36\" /></section><p>It\u2019s not all roses, though. The X-T30 is limited to recording 10 minutes of 4K video at a time, which can make shooting reviews a PITA. And, perhaps more importantly, I may have joined the Fujifilm flock at the exact wrong time. For years the company cultivated a loyal fan base with its philosophy of \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen\">kaizen</a>,\u201d which saw it continuously updating even older devices to bring new features and bug fixes. Unfortunately, the company has started to move away from that in recent years.</p><p>The X-T30 last received a firmware update over one year ago, in early October of 2021, and that was almost entirely minor bug fixes. It wasn\u2019t even three years old at that point. The company introduced the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-gfx-50s-ii-annoucement-222121748.html\">X-T30 II</a> around the same time which from a hardware point of view is almost identical, but it has a host of new software features and film simulations. There seems to be no technical reason that many of those features couldn\u2019t be ported over to the slightly older camera, especially the film sims, but Fuji has left some of its users out in the cold.</p><figure><img alt=\"Fujifilm X-T30\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/50adf120-5ac4-11ed-bdeb-5dc7aea990a3\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Here\u2019s hoping Fujifilm remembers that it attracted dedicated followers by focusing on the experience and delivering regular meaningful updates to users. Because, while I love my camera, and do think it is probably the best camera for me, I\u2019m a little concerned that I discovered the Fuji community just in time for it to evaporate.</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/waymo-driverless-taxi-permit-california-dmv-150046627.html?src=rss", "title": "Waymo is one step closer to charging for self-driving taxis in California", "date_published": "2022-11-10 15:00:46+00:00", "description": "<p>Waymo is considerably nearer to offering <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/waymo-fully-driverless-rides-san-francisco-183703989.html\">fully driverless rides</a> to California residents.

If anyone on your gift list is serious about diving into the business of video game streaming, these are the gadgets they\u2019ll be ecstatic to unwrap (and show off on-camera).</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>Elgato Wave:3</h2><figure><img alt=\"Elgato Wave:3\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/e4f1e660-5944-11ed-a2fd-2a603ef447e0\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwODhISFdDNDc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tNDItMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjQzNzkzOWUxLWU4NGEtMzc0Ni04NTlmLTFkNjk5NDYzMjc1ZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdK17mWcJ_NKJEvLJAXflTlFBjZE5a3li3nhOC3Q2WVp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB088HHWC47\">Wave:3</a> is solid.

While the company doesn't get any more specific about the tech specs than that, it's safe to assume it's not the same exact setup in this $900 stompbox. There are 62 effects algorithms built-in to the H90 and, unlike the H9 (which has only 52 algorithms) you can run two of them simultaneously for more exotic and extreme effects.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"f52c35d9eaef4c6793d00274ea630202\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>You'll still find all the sounds from Eventide's TimeFactor, ModFactor, PitchFactor, and Space pedals, as well classics from the company's older rack mount units like the SP2016 Reverb. Headlining the new effects is probably Polyphonic Pitch Shifting, which uses Eventide\u2019s SIFT (Spectral Instantaneous Frequency Tracking) tech. This isn't the first effects processor to do polyphonic pitch shifting, but it's not super common (and it's quite difficult from a technical perspective).&nbsp;</p><p>The six other new algorithms exclusive to the H90 include Prism Shift, which turns chords into arpeggiated synth delays; Even-Vibe, a Uni-vibe emulation with envelope followers; and Wormhole, a massive modulated reverb with pitch warping.</p><figure><img alt=\"Eventide H90 Harmonizer\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/f1f3c720-60f6-11ed-bd5f-afac149a4f3e\" style=\"height: 1280; width: 1920;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Eventide</div></figure><p>The other huge upgrade over the H9 is that the 90 has actual on board controls and a much cleaner UI. The original had one large knob and basically required you to use the companion app for anything beyond switching presets. The H90 on the other hand has five knobs, a trio of foot switches and a handful of buttons that should make it not just feasible, but simple to customize and tweak effects settings. But, there is still a companion app for macOS and Windows.</p><p>There's connectivity galore here too. Four mono audio ins and outs, two expression control ports, 5-pin MIDI in and outs, plus USB for MIDI and software updates. Those audio jacks offer a lot of flexibility too. You can process two audio signals independently, or set them up as sends and returns to put other effects pedals in between two algorithms on the H90.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, and it has a tuner.&nbsp;</p><p>The Eventide H90 is available now for $899.</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/musk-ends-remote-work-at-twitter-123547728.html?src=rss", "title": "Elon Musk bans Twitter employees from working remotely", "date_published": "2022-11-10 12:35:47+00:00", "description": "<p>Elon Musk has banned <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-reportedly-asks-some-laid-off-workers-to-return-233438794.html\">Twitter employees</a> from working remotely, saying they need to spend 40 hours a week in the office unless he gives his express permission otherwise. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-10/musk-s-first-email-to-twitter-staff-ends-remote-work?sref=10lNAhZ9\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reported from the company\u2019s first official all-hands communications from Musk since bought the platform.

It expects to issue most of them (including those for hardware purchases) by the time it shuts down the Stadia servers on January 18th.</p><p>This won\u2019t encompass Stadia Pro subscription fees, however.
