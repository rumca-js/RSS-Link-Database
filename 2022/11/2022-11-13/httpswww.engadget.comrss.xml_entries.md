<p>Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts chastised Elon Musk on Sunday after the billionaire had a snarky response to the lawmaker’s request for information about Twitter’s new verification policies. “Perhaps it is because your real account sounds like a parody?” Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1591813228119855104?s=20&amp;t=7TlNymyIcowZ8jOf38yKVQ">tweeted</a> Sunday morning after Markey shared <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senator-markey-twitter-elon-musk-letter-223210329.html">a recent letter</a> he sent criticizing the company’s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-verification-impersonation-disaster-203656712.html">$8 per month Twitter Blue subscription</a>.  “And why does your pp have a mask!?” Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1591817319143313408?s=20&amp;t=7TlNymyIcowZ8jOf38yKVQ">added a few hours later</a>, referring to Markey’s profile picture, which shows the senator wearing a face covering.</p><div id="8f6e811a755b49c78a2c82832ad17e6b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">One of your companies is under an FTC consent decree.

In the letter, Markey asks Musk to explain how <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/11/twitter-blue-checkmark/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> was able to create a verified account impersonating him and why an official pop-up told Twitter users the verification was due to a role in government.

While the service was available, trolls used it to impersonate celebrities, politicians and brands, leading to chaos on the platform. One account pretending to be LeBron James claimed the NBA star had <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/verified-twitter-accounts-impersonating-lebron-james-george-w-bush-aroldis-chapman/">requested</a> to be traded by the Los Angeles Lakers.

Markey is also a member of the Subcommittee on Communication, Media, and Broadband, the Senate panel most likely to recommend action against Twitter.</p>

## Twitter will soon let organizations verify related accounts

<p>Less than two days after Twitter’s first attempt to charge for account verification <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-verification-impersonation-disaster-203656712.html"><ins>ended in disaster</ins></a>, Elon Musk announced the company is working on a new way to authenticate users. On Sunday afternoon, he <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1591851391773200384?s=20&amp;t=wopaluf5GMjhH9jyZwRn5A"><ins>tweeted</ins></a> the social media website would soon begin rolling out a feature that will allow organizations to identify accounts that are “actually” associated with them.</p><div id="8c3c8c76436642898ae4e96a29b2fcb9"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Rolling out soon, Twitter will enable organizations to identify which other Twitter accounts are actually associated with them</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1591851391773200384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>Musk didn’t say as much, but the feature is almost certainly a partial response to the problems the platform encountered this past week. After the company began rolling out its new $8 per month Twitter Blue subscription on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-blue-now-available-190106760.html"><ins>Wednesday</ins></a>, the website was quickly overrun by trolls who used the service to impersonate celebrities and brands. In particular, the situation was a nightmare for businesses and advertisers. As one example, pharmaceutical company <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/no-insulin-not-free-eli-221824378.html"><ins>Eli Lilly’s stock fell by 4.37 percent</ins></a> on Friday after a fake "verified" account said the company was making insulin free. The prank erased about 15 billion from Eli Lilly’s market cap and forced an apology from it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The announcement would seem to indicate Musk is coming to terms with the fact that a social media platform <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428132/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-problems-speech-moderation"><ins>can’t exist without content moderation</ins></a>. When a user asked him if anyone would be able to use the upcoming feature, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1591852141370548224?s=20&amp;t=wopaluf5GMjhH9jyZwRn5A">Musk responded</a>: “Ultimately, I think there is no choice but for Twitter to be the final arbiter, but I’m open to suggestions.”</p><p>That’s something he probably wouldn’t have said before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html"><ins>taking over Twitter</ins></a>. Prior to closing the deal, Musk cast himself as a free speech “absolutist.” During his recent TED Talk appearance, he said he was in favor of very little content moderation. “If in doubt, let the speech… let it exist. If it’s a gray area, I would say let the tweet exist,” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-ted-181607962.html"><ins>he said at the time</ins></a>. The problem with that approach is that it has led to an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-losing-advertisers-boycott-193748977.html"><ins>advertiser exodus</ins></a> and a significant drop in revenue for the company. That’s not something Twitter can sustain with its current <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/30/technology/elon-musk-twitter-debt.html"><ins>debt load</ins></a>.</p>

## Twitter reportedly cuts contract workforce following mass layoffs

<p>After laying off <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-layoffs-010148183.html"><ins>50 percent of the company’s employees</ins></a>, Elon Musk has turned his attention to Twitter’s contract workers. According to separate reports from <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1591608302076858371?s=20&amp;t=CSM1Ho7q3WNacwXDI4brvA"><em><ins>Platformer’s</ins></em><ins> Casey Newton</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/11/13/elon-musk-twitter-contractor-layoffs"><em><ins>Axios</ins></em></a><em>, </em>the social media platform began reducing its contingent staff on Saturday afternoon. The scale of the job cuts is unclear, but Newton puts it at “a large number,” with the company’s content moderation and marketing teams among those affected by the layoffs.</p><div id="b571be8f3c154f65b9991a2428773d28"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Getting word that a large number of number of Twitter contractors were just laid off this afternoon with no notice, both in the US and abroad.

Many found out they weren’t working for the company anymore after they abruptly lost access to Twitter’s internal systems. “One of my contractors just got deactivated without notice in the middle of making critical changes to our child safety workflows,” one manager posted in the company’s Slack, <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1591608307927556096?s=20&amp;t=CSM1Ho7q3WNacwXDI4brvA"><ins>according to Newton</ins></a>. Yet others found out by reading the reports about the cuts. Some workers are now worried they may not get paid for their last two weeks of work. Following Twitter’s November 4th layoffs, many contractors ended up on teams with no full-time staff, leaving no one to sign off on their time sheets.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Twitter did not immediately respond to Engadget’s request for comment. The company reportedly cut its entire communications department during its recent reorganization.</p><p>The cuts come at the end of another turbulent week at Twitter.

Musk also reportedly told employees Twitter was losing so much money that bankruptcy was "not out of the question.”</p>
