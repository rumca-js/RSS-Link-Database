Some of you have been selling yourselves on <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rachel-dolezal-onlyfans\" target=\"_blank\">OnlyFans</a> for some extra cash. Well, maybe not some of <em>YOU</em>. If you're reading this, I assume you have dignity and self-respect for yourself. But others have been selling themselves on <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/onlyfans-cocaine-vagina\" target=\"_blank\">OnlyFans</a> from the comfort of their own homes. We'll file that under \"you do you.\"</p><p>HOWEVER, if I could offer one bit of advice... stay away from schools. A teacher couple filmed their sex work in the classroom THEY worked in. Now they are fired. Arizona teachers Samantha and Dillon Peer were employed by the <a href=\"https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/lake-havasu-husband-and-wife-teachers-fired-for-onlyfans-content\" target=\"_blank\">Lake Havasu Unified School District</a>. Students found their sexual <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/onlyfans-miami-candidate\" target=\"_blank\">OnlyFans</a> content on the internet because that's how the internet works. Now, the Peers are unemployed and Samantha wants you to feel bad.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n<span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>\n<small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Video: Teacher Samantha Peer speaks out</small>\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/PKIzI7uj7x4\" target=\"_blank\">youtu.be</a>\n</small>\n</p>\n<blockquote>My children are the most important thing to me and I'm already spending countless hours outside of my contract time on extra school activities, and I don't think it's fair that I have to sacrifice my own children's time because our professional salary did not pay enough.</blockquote><p>So she made porn in the classroom. For sake of argument, we are defining \"porn\" as content you should not film in the classroom. Either way:</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6bc2d\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32089062&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>Peer also doesn't understand what the big deal is. While she admitted that she filmed explicit content in her middle school classroom, she only did so AFTER school and on weekends. There were no students there. So, what's the big deal?</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"9f722\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32089065&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>The big deal is that one of the images was, allegedly, her posing in a sexual position on her teacher's desk. At least one student came across the content and said \"hey, that desk looks familiar\" followed by \"hey, that teacher looks familiar.\"</p><p>So what have we learned today? We learned that depending on your primary source of income, you should keep your kink in your house. We learned how the internet works and that if you think someone won't find something they already have. And, we learned how dumb some of the people teaching our children are. Such as a couple getting freaky in their classroom and being chiuckleheaded enough to think it will won't end badly for them.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

The western drama has earned the title of being an \"anti-woke\" show. </p><p>You become anti-woke for one of two reasons. The first is that your show doesn't overtly sh*t all over conservatives, and conservatives enjoy not overtly being sh*t on. The second is that your show doesn't overtly sh*t all over conservatives, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11418753/Non-woke-Yellowstone-create-slams-liberal-media-branding-hit-series-red-state-show.html\" target=\"_blank\">and liberals think it's weird that it doesn't</a>. Hence, Yellowstone becomes a \"red state show\" and creator Taylor Sheridan wishes it wouldn't.</p><p>Sheridan gave an interview <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/12/yellowstone-tv-series-taylor-sheridan/671897/\" target=\"_blank\">with The Atlantic</a>. The same outlet that wants there to be a \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pandemic-amnesty-video\" target=\"_blank\">pandemic amnesty</a>.\"</p><blockquote>Sheridan insists that <em>Yellowstone</em> is not a \u201cred-state show.\u201d \u201cThey refer to it as \u2018the conservative show\u2019 or \u2018the Republican show\u2019 or \u2018the red-state <em>Game of Thrones</em>,\u2019 \u201d he told me. \u201cAnd I just sit back laughing. I\u2019m like, \u2018Really?\u2019 The show\u2019s talking about the displacement of Native Americans and the way Native American women were treated and about corporate greed and the gentrification of the West, and land-grabbing. That\u2019s a red-state show?\u201d</blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b0402\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32088847&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>Correct. You become a \"red state show\" when you take place in what leftists call \"fly-over country,\" and use your platform to do something other than validate the progressive agenda. That doesn't mean the show doesn't get political. And newsflash: if it gets political, 99% of the time it's left-leaning because it's still Hollywood.</p><p>But <em><a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/yellowstone-cole-hauser-bar-fights\" target=\"_blank\">Yellowstone</a></em> focuses more on compelling characters and storytelling than politics, and occasionally shows a progressive ideal in an unflattering light. That's all it takes for liberal media outlets to call it  \"a conservative fantasy\" or attack it as \"Game of Thrones set on a ranch.\"</p><p>Whether or not the \"red state\" or \"anti-woke\" labels are what's costing the show awards, your guess is as good as mine. Also, your guess is the same as mine. </p><p>Sheridan should just be happy people enjoy his work without sounding annoyed by it. For me, all I need is Cole Hauser killing a bunch of people set to an awesome country music soundtrack.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

As I look at the ink splotch, I don't see him mocking Kanye. I see him telling jokes about a story that was in the news. It's broken up into two parts. <em>\"I've probably been doing this thirty-five years now.

And I hope they don\u2019t take anything away from me, whoever <em><strong>they</strong></em> are.<br /><br /></blockquote><p>When I look at these ink splotches I see what I usually see: another masterful performance from Dave Chappelle. One where I'm too busy laughing to try and decipher whatever he's trying to tell us. More often than not, it's just jokes.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
