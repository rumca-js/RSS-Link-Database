  <p id="GojDQr">Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) told Elon Musk, “Fix your companies. Or Congress will,” after Musk snarkily replied to the senator’s concerns about fake verified accounts on Twitter, and suggested Markey’s real account “sounds like a parody.”</p>
<p id="D9uUxZ">On Friday, Markey <a href="https://twitter.com/SenMarkey/status/1591164312168824832?s=20&amp;t=2oG9wZbEEd9zFQ_HqNFoWw">sent out a tweet</a> containing a <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-demands-answers-from-twitter-on-disinformation-and-fake-accounts">link to a letter</a> he wrote to Musk, criticizing the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/1/23435092/elon-musk-twitter-blue-verification-cost-ads-search">new $7.99 per month Blue</a> with verification subscription. The letter cites <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/11/twitter-blue-checkmark/">a report from the <em>Washington Post</em></a> that details how a reporter was able to easily create a fake verified account impersonating Markey and calls on Musk to address the issue. “Twitter must explain how this happened and how to prevent it from happening again,” Markey writes.</p>
