Talking heads attested to their vast influence and reminisced about the kind of misadventures that tend to befall a band apparently existing on a diet largely composed of LSD. But the whole thing was undercut with sadness. The surviving members of what’s generally considered Hawkwind’s classic lineup – the one that recorded their unlikely hit single Silver Machine and the extraordinary 1973 live album Space Ritual – had fallen out, apparently irrevocably. There was clearly very little love lost between bassist Lemmy and his former bandmates while Hawkwind’s one constant member and de-facto leader, guitarist and vocalist Dave Brock, refused to take part in the documentary at all, “due,” the voiceover glumly announced, “to the participation of Nik Turner”.</p><p>Turner and Brock’s relationship had long been fractious, perhaps scarred by Turner’s desire to be noticed in a band with no obvious frontman (Brock, Turner, Lemmy and the band’s troubled lyricist Robert Calvert shared lead vocals; another lyricist, the science fiction author Michael Moorcock frequently gave readings on stage) and that presented audiences with a lot to look at: quite aside from the musicians, there was the eye-popping psychedelic light show and the presence of the statuesque and frequently naked dancer Miss Stacia to contend with. The first time Turner parted company with Hawkwind, in 1976, he was fired after playing his saxophone over the other members’ solos and vocals on stage “despite repeated requests not to”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/13/open-minded-and-truly-eclectic-nik-turner-was-the-spirit-of-hawkwind">Continue reading...</a>

First British cyclist to complete the Tour de France, so paving the way for other Britons to succeed in the sport in mainland Europe<p>Brian Robinson, who has died aged 91, was the first Briton not only to complete the Tour de France but then to go on to win a Tour stage. </p><p>His landmark Tour completion came in 1955, when he battled on to the finish in 29th place overall. Three years later, after a number of trials and tribulations on and off the road, he achieved a Tour stage victory over a section from St Brieuc to Brest, followed by another in 1959, from Annecy to Chalon-sur-Saône.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/13/brian-robinson-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A young west African keen to go to Europe discovers the price of making a new life in this novella by the Burkinabe academic and activist</p><p>Migration is once again headline news, after the home secretary, Suella Braverman, controversially referred to asylum seekers crossing the Channel as an “invasion” as the UK’s handling of them descended into apparent chaos. Halfway through Monique Ilboudo’s astute novella (deftly translated by Yarri Kamara) her male protagonist meditates on how human mobility is defined by perspective and nationality: “Why are some people <em>expatriates, </em>while others<em> migrate, emigrate </em>or <em>immigrate… </em>In French, one expatriates oneself – <em>s’expatrier</em><em>… </em>This is a choice: an act of will, not of fire under your bottom. When I migrate, I do not have a choice. It is the winds of poverty or of war that push me out of my home.”</p><p>Set in the fictional west African town of Ouabany, <em>So Distant From My Life </em>follows the fortunes of Jeanphi who, determined not to be “a collateral victim of International Monetary Fund structural adjustment programmes”, seeks salvation abroad: “Our common quest is to try to live a better life. I sought to live better… Just a small corner on this vast Earth where I, too, could blossom.”</p><p><em>So Distant from My Life</em> by Monique Ilboudo, translated by Yarri Kamara, is published by Tilted Axis Press (£9.99).

Our three kids love it – they were so jealous when they heard I was coming here with the <em>Observer</em>…”</p><p>Seven years also dates the moment when the family’s life turned upside down when Nadiya <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/live/2015/oct/07/great-british-bake-off-2015-final-live" title="">became </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/live/2015/oct/07/great-british-bake-off-2015-final-live" title="">Bake Off </a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/live/2015/oct/07/great-british-bake-off-2015-final-live" title="">champion</a> and instant national treasure.

She is a brilliant mix of things. She talks 20 to the dozen as we order her family favourites – “hummus because it comes with great bread, for sure the lamb’s liver – delicious! – the adana skewers, if you like spicy, halloumi, chops” – but she also has a kind of quiet poise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/nov/13/nadiya-hussain-family-food-bake-off-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Call Me By Your Name director on his new film about teenage cannibals falling in love, ​the view that it’s his most personal work, and why Italy is a very scary farce</p><p>How do cannibals kiss? It must get messy, with a certain amount of lip-chewing involved. There’s a mass of bloody crimson – a maelstrom of near-abstract swirls, from which two faces emerge as you gaze – in a painting by American artist Elizabeth Peyton, which appeared this autumn in a huge reproduction on the facade of the 13th-century palazzo Ca’ de Mosta in Venice. It’s the first poster image for <em>Bones and All</em>, the latest film by Italian director Luca Guadagnino, which tells a story of two young cannibals in love.</p><p>Guadagnino recalls: “I said to Elizabeth, ‘Find the image in the movie that you want to comment on’ and she found the final kiss, which is a very ambiguous kiss. Is it a kiss of love or a kiss of annihilation? Is it a kiss of eating the other or a kiss of falling into the other? The kiss is <em>always</em> a very dangerous moment – particularly because of two years of Covid,” he says with a laugh.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/13/director-luca-guadagnino-bones-and-all-interview-call-me-by-your-name">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Irish studio Cartoon Saloon’s hand-drawn eco-parable is another winner</p><p>There’s an appealingly fecund quality to the hand-drawn animations produced by the Irish studio Cartoon Saloon (<em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/31/wolfwalkers-review-cartoon-salon-tomm-moore">Wolfwalkers</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/12/song-of-the-sea-review">Song of the Sea</a></em>) – stories that unfold in verdant worlds that always seem about to burst into bud or leaf.

But in contrast to its heyday in the 1960s and 1970s (captured, appropriately, on scratchy Super 8 home movies), the club is now on its uppers. A headcount of its ageing membership barely scrapes into double figures; they haven’t paid the rent on their clubhouse for five years. And the building itself is shedding chunks of masonry and plaster, its creaky stairs a looming hazard to the hips of its increasingly doddery regulars.</p><p>But, as this terrific and very moving documentary shows, the society, fuelled by bickering, biscuits and cinephilia, is a lifeline for its members, who weather bereavements, loneliness and fiercely argued creative differences within its peeling walls.

Word had come through that one of my aunts had died in Lagos. Not from Covid but of a sudden heart attack. It is hard to know what to do in moments of grief at the best of times. But there and then, as air travel remained a virtual impossibility and our vast, widely dispersed Nigerian family had never felt more atomised or isolated, it was even harder.</p><p>The moment, it seemed, called for whatever socially distanced togetherness my mother, brothers and I could muster; it called for the comforting certainty of a barbecued beef dish, vigorously spiced and with the deep umami of roasted peanuts, that is practically a Nigerian way of life. Yes, the moment called for suya. And so, that is how I found myself outside Alhaji Suya’s commercial kitchen on a south London industrial estate, waiting for my order.

<p>Qatar’s new stadiums are Instagram-ready and waiting, but there’s no getting away from the environmental cost of their construction – nor the question of what to do with them when the crowds go home</p><p>Qatar’s impending World Cup, which kicks off next Sunday, does not only require the creation of vast sporting infrastructure almost from scratch. It also comes with a striking fetish – in the case of six of its eight stadia claiming to look like things that they are not: a “diamond in the desert”; a traditional woven cap; the sails (or possibly the hulls) of a pearl fishing dhow; a nomads’ tent; an ancient ceramic bowl that is also a candlelit lantern; a sand dune that is also a shield. There’s something a bit gift shop, a bit tourist tat, about this shifting of shapes and scales – an Eiffel Tower cigarette lighter, anyone? A koala made of seashells? But the designers and marketing wizards behind this construction project, variously reported in a range from £5.7bn to £8.7bn, seem to think that metaphorical monikers are somehow essential to their grand project.</p><p>The stadium designs do at least take to some sort of parodic conclusion the logic of “iconic” architecture over the past quarter-century, which is to get big names to design something striking, marketable and (since the invention of the platform) Instagram-friendly.

ENO was given 24 hours’ notice of the decision on 3 November, before <a href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/blog/investing-future-music" title="">the public announcement</a>.

<p>The actor and environmentalist on playing Atticus Finch, the character’s importance today, and why he dyed his hair white for Stranger Things</p><p>Actor Matthew Modine, born in California in 1959, came to fame in the 1980s, most notably in Stanley Kubrick’s <em>Full Metal Jacket</em> (1987). More recently, he’s best known for playing Dr Martin Brenner, the sinister scientist in the Netflix series <em>Stranger Things</em>. Next week, he steps into the role of the crusading Atticus Finch, a lawyer defending an innocent black man on a charge of rape, in Aaron Sorkin’s adaptation of Harper Lee’s novel <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> in the West End. Married since 1980, he has two children and lives in New York.</p><p><strong>What made you want to play the part of Atticus Finch?<br /></strong>The content of the story – it’s specifically about the history of racism in the United States. The past is not something that’s ancient history. As Aaron Sorkin writes in his adaptation, the civil war is yesterday and it will always be yesterday until we deal honestly with that past. In the US, there’s a crack in the foundation of the constitution because “we the people” didn’t include people of colour when it was drafted. We’ve never honestly dealt with that and when you build a country the foundation is very important. What we’re seeing today is what happens when the walls start to get out of whack, the doors don’t open and the roof starts leaking. We just have to be aware of what happened in the past so that we can fix it and move forward. The play deals with that. I wanted to be a part of it, because I want to be a part of solving problems.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/13/matthew-modine-to-kill-a-mocking-bird-stranger-things-kubrick-interview">Continue reading...</a>

The boy wears a cute suits and is then dispatched. It’s the best of all worlds<p>Last week, my sister, Caoimhe, got married, so I was back in Derry with my entire family for the first time in almost a decade. It was a beautiful service, held in a converted barn near our family home. My son chafed at his adorable suit and tie, but we reminded him its charms were for our enjoyment, not his, and he contented himself by playing with his similarly well-dressed cousins. The service was filled with personal touches and several of my siblings got up and sang beautifully. I should clarify they were asked to do so and this was not one last show of one-upmanship within a family so large competition for attention has always been critical.</p><p>Despite my own beautiful singing voice, I was instead asked to write and perform some closing words for the ceremony. To the alarm and dismay of my more golden-throated siblings, I wrote a poem that was so good – funny, touching, it rhymed, etc – that I came out very much on top. Sure, my brother, Shane, has a rich baritone, but did he actually write She Moves Through The Fair?

Time was when a dishonourable member would resign and disappear for good after a scandal. Not any more<p>Scandal is a motif of extended periods of Tory government. The longer the stretch of uninterrupted Conservative rule, the bigger the scandals tend to get. At the fag end of Harold Macmillan’s premiership in 1963, the most lurid of them was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/23/john-profumo-christine-keeler-refutes-rumours-1963" title="">the Profumo affair</a>. The story is well known and can be summarised in two sentences. Jack Profumo was secretary of state for war and shared a lover, Christine Keeler, with a military attache at the Russian embassy. Profumo lied about it to the Commons, was forced to admit to the lie and resigned for committing what was then an unpardonable offence in British politics. All very sensational, but it is what happened next that is most remarkable to the contemporary eye. Profumo did not hang around in politics hoping that the clouds of disgrace would dissipate and he might contrive some kind of comeback. He did not try to worm his way back into government or bag himself a seat for life in the Lords or reinvent himself as a media celebrity. Profumo accepted that he had obliterated his political career, quit parliament, devoted the remainder of his life to charitable endeavours and ultimately secured some rehabilitation of his reputation from these good works.</p><p>This penitential model for the shamed minister is not followed by disgraced politicians of the modern era. They do not dress themselves in sackcloth and seek redemption through exemplary service to others. Exhibit number one is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/27/if-this-were-an-ethical-government-matt-hancock-would-have-gone-instantly" title="">Matt Hancock</a>.

He’s jetted down under to trouser a large sum from an unreality TV show and justifies going absent without leave from Westminster on the grounds that representing his constituents is less important than showing the public “who I am”. Matt, mate, no one is interested in discovering the “real” you. There is no evidence that such a thing exists. I guess he calculated that getting showered with liquid excrement on TV might persuade voters to like him a little more, but you can stuff him with Australia’s entire supply of crocodile cock and it will not assuage the <a href="https://twitter.com/CovidJusticeUK/status/1587432616047017984" title="">justifiable anger</a> of the relatives of Covid victims.

I’ve unleashed all the chemical weapons, making my way through every lotion on the chemist’s shelves. But eradication doesn’t work when nits are circulating in your child’s class. All you can hope to do is keep them at bay with a good old nit comb.

<p>Ukraine’s step towards victory presents challenges, but demonstrates what can be done with a steady supply of western support</p><p>The Russian decision to withdraw from the Ukrainian city of Kherson to defensive positions on the left bank of the Dnipro River was driven by sound military logic. Russian control of the city could only be maintained at a steep price in troops and materiel. Operationally, the withdrawal should help the Russians stabilise their defensive positions over the winter. Strategically, the withdrawal is an unambiguous Russian defeat.</p><p>When Ukraine launched its counteroffensive against Kherson at the end of August its military knew it lacked the combat power to storm the city. However, strikes on the bridges over the Dnipro limited Russia’s ability to supply its troops with heavy equipment, while the river protected Ukrainian forces from counterattack. This favourable battlefield geometry allowed Ukraine to create a killing area in which its artillery could inflict heavy casualties on Russia’s most motivated and competent units.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/13/russias-loss-of-kherson-signals-change-in-putins-strategy-ukraine">Continue reading...</a>

## Skinniness is back in fashion, but did it ever really go away? | Eva Wiseman

The style press might be reporting that ‘thin is in’, but lurking behind the headlines is alarming knowledge that the continuing obsession has been there all along<p>I respect the Halloween tradition of successfully sluttifying that which, on any other night, would refuse to be sluttified. Scrolling through photos last week I saw multiple slutty ghosts, multiple slutty <em>Toy Story</em> characters. I saw many, many cleavages, one attached to a Minion, and I saw both Marge Simpson and Cinderella’s bottoms. But while I always applaud the mission, one which never goes out of style, this year I was struck by something else – the skinniness.</p><p>“Thin is back,” the style press is reporting, warily. When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/03/kim-kardashian-wears-marilyn-monroes-jfk-dress-as-met-gala-celebrates-gilded-age" title="">Kim Kardashian wore Marilyn Monroe’s old gown</a> to the Met Gala, most news stories concentrated on the scandal of a museum piece being disrespected. But for women, young women especially, the real story ran way down in paragraphs four and five: it was the extreme diet Kardashian went on, eating only the “cleanest veggies and proteins”, in order to make that sparkly dress fit. Similar diets were happening in student kitchens across the UK and shared online in hashtags and well-lit videos. It’s no coincidence that this culture shift, these Halloween costumes featuring vast plains of taut belly, coincides with the return of Y2K fashion. With the return of baby tees and low-rise jeans came the memory for many of how such clothes helped inspire in us the idea that it wasn’t that these clothes did not fit our bodies, it was our bodies that did not fit these clothes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/13/skinniness-is-back-in-fashion-but-did-it-ever-really-go-away">Continue reading...</a>

Tim Minchin refuses to be categorised. So what do we call a man who tells jokes, challenges political tribalism and writes songs that move you to tears? Eva Wiseman meets the man behind Matilda the Musical – and much more<p>I had not expected to cry. I had not expected to cry three times. A screening of a kids’ film, 8.30 in the morning, a <em>musical</em> for Christ’s sake, and out of nowhere, I was crying. “Shall I tell you why?” asks Tim Minchin the next day, leaning forward over a precarious little table of tea. And then he tells me and I have to hold my breath to stop myself crying again.</p><p>Minchin is a musical comedian who dissects ideas of romance, monogamy and faith during “logical philosophy lectures described as cabaret shows”, in eyeliner, big hair and bare feet. In 2009, when he was 35, the RSC invited him to collaborate on an adaptation of Roald Dahl’s <em>Matilda</em>, and his career shifted to include composer of multi-award-winning musicals. His life shifted with it – he moved with his family from Melbourne to London to LA (where he spent four years working on an animated film that was rudely canned), and then back to Sydney. The show was a hit – a proper dark and artful phenomenon. Today, Minchin has flown in to talk about the film, a vivid and gorgeous adaptation by Minchin and the theatre team, starring Emma Thompson as a hulking Miss Trunchbull.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/13/tim-minchin-comedian-musician-matilda-weve-forgotten-how-to-be-innocent">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After befriending the bluesman​ years earlier, the renowned photographer​ caught this enquiring glance ​when he attended his burial</p><p>William Eggleston, the old master of American colour photography, took this picture at the funeral of the Mississippi bluesman Fred McDowell in 1972. Earlier, he had made a photograph of McDowell in his coffin, his head surrounded by white satin. The pair of them had become friends after Eggleston knocked on McDowell’s door one day and asked if he could shoot some film footage of him playing guitar. Here, Eggleston was at the back of the chapel, a dapper southern white man, who grew up in a plantation house, taking pictures. The young woman’s look seems to take in all of that oddness – Eggleston often elicited such gazes from strangers – and his camera flinches from none of it.</p><p>The film footage of McDowell was lost. When Eggleston later described it to a journalist, he said the playing had entailed “wandering, then surges of melody”. That description might also delineate the photographer’s methods. Eggleston, now 83, changed the landscape of the American imagination with <a href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/2079">his exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1976</a>; the accompanying book to that show, which introduced the artist’s saturated dye-transfer prints of the suburban south, was called <em>William Eggleston’s Guide</em>; it became exactly that for a generation of film-makers and photographers, in search of authentic American alienation.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.davidzwirnerbooks.com/product/william-eggleston-the-outlands-selected-works">William Eggleston: The Outlands</a></em> is published by David Zwirner Books (£75).

<p>This fascinating biography tenderly links the life and work of the woman whose timeless novels grappled with the power of passion</p><p>In 1982, Shirley Hazzard flew to Britain for a reunion with Alec Vedeniapine, a man with whom she had been in love more than 30 years before. Vedeniapine and his wife farmed in Wales, and their world – cats and cows; damp, rural isolation - couldn’t have been more different from that of Hazzard, who lived with her husband, Francis Steegmuller, a biographer of Cocteau and Flaubert, on New York’s Upper East Side in an apartment filled with paintings by Matisse and Picasso. Yet the contrast only made her feelings for Vedeniapine the more categorical. The considerable achievements of her own life were, even now, to be measured (favourably) against her sense of what she felt he had “renounced” all those decades ago. Carefully closing her eyes to the existence of his family, she found herself struck by “this theme – this transcendent theme – of fulfilment and non-fulfilment; and those who bind themselves to limitations”. Though the two of them would stay in touch, they did not meet again.</p><p>As I’ve written it, this may sound unkind, cold to a degree. In fact, the opposite is true. Hazzard’s judgments – in life, as on the page – were born of a deep intensity of feeling; a sensitivity that was unfashionably romantic. She and Vedeniapine had fallen for each other in postwar Hong Kong, only to be separated when Hazzard, then still a teenager, had to follow her parents to New Zealand, a move made for the sake of her sister, who was ill with tuberculosis. But the memory of their broken engagement – ended by Vedeniapine in a letter – would stay with her for ever, underpinning all that she wrote. Love between two people, she believed, is never a small thing. It may be frangible, the victim of fated misalignments, but its mark is permanent. The abiding themes of her marvellous novels – there are just four, of which the most celebrated is <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-transit-of-venus-9781860491818">The Transit of Venus</a></em>, published in 1980 – are love and destiny; devastation, for her characters, is always around the corner for the simple reason that vast and unseen forces are working unceasingly to impede love’s bliss and power, its ineffable ability to change everything in a stroke.<br /><br />Brigitta Olubas’s new biography of Hazzard runs to more than 500 pages and I must admit that I approached it with trepidation. Olubas is an academic at an Australian university and her subject’s life was, to a large extent, inward: a writing life, above all. It seemed impossible that she would be a good match for a storyteller who gives her readers (passionately devoted, but still far too few in number) access to the most grand of emotions; whose husband said of her piercing final novel, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/dec/14/fiction.features">The Great Fire</a></em>: “No one should have to read it for the first time.” There would, I assumed, be jargon of the kind that Hazzard, an autodidact who disliked modernism in most of its forms, would have loathed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/13/shirley-hazzard-a-writing-life-by-brigitta-olubas-review-doyenne-of-love-and-devastation">Continue reading...</a>
