Profumo lied about it to the Commons, was forced to admit to the lie and resigned for committing what was then an unpardonable offence in British politics. All very sensational, but it is what happened next that is most remarkable to the contemporary eye. Profumo did not hang around in politics hoping that the clouds of disgrace would dissipate and he might contrive some kind of comeback. He did not try to worm his way back into government or bag himself a seat for life in the Lords or reinvent himself as a media celebrity. Profumo accepted that he had obliterated his political career, quit parliament, devoted the remainder of his life to charitable endeavours and ultimately secured some rehabilitation of his reputation from these good works.</p><p>This penitential model for the shamed minister is not followed by disgraced politicians of the modern era.

Vedeniapine and his wife farmed in Wales, and their world \u2013 cats and cows; damp, rural isolation - couldn\u2019t have been more different from that of Hazzard, who lived with her husband, Francis Steegmuller, a biographer of Cocteau and Flaubert, on New York\u2019s Upper East Side in an apartment filled with paintings by Matisse and Picasso. Yet the contrast only made her feelings for Vedeniapine the more categorical. The considerable achievements of her own life were, even now, to be measured (favourably) against her sense of what she felt he had \u201crenounced\u201d all those decades ago. Carefully closing her eyes to the existence of his family, she found herself struck by \u201cthis theme \u2013 this transcendent theme \u2013 of fulfilment and non-fulfilment; and those who bind themselves to limitations\u201d. Though the two of them would stay in touch, they did not meet again.</p><p>As I\u2019ve written it, this may sound unkind, cold to a degree. In fact, the opposite is true. Hazzard\u2019s judgments \u2013 in life, as on the page \u2013 were born of a deep intensity of feeling; a sensitivity that was unfashionably romantic. She and Vedeniapine had fallen for each other in postwar Hong Kong, only to be separated when Hazzard, then still a teenager, had to follow her parents to New Zealand, a move made for the sake of her sister, who was ill with tuberculosis. But the memory of their broken engagement \u2013 ended by Vedeniapine in a letter \u2013 would stay with her for ever, underpinning all that she wrote. Love between two people, she believed, is never a small thing. It may be frangible, the victim of fated misalignments, but its mark is permanent. The abiding themes of her marvellous novels \u2013 there are just four, of which the most celebrated is <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-transit-of-venus-9781860491818\">The Transit of Venus</a></em>, published in 1980 \u2013 are love and destiny; devastation, for her characters, is always around the corner for the simple reason that vast and unseen forces are working unceasingly to impede love\u2019s bliss and power, its ineffable ability to change everything in a stroke.<br /><br />Brigitta Olubas\u2019s new biography of Hazzard runs to more than 500 pages and I must admit that I approached it with trepidation. Olubas is an academic at an Australian university and her subject\u2019s life was, to a large extent, inward: a writing life, above all. It seemed impossible that she would be a good match for a storyteller who gives her readers (passionately devoted, but still far too few in number) access to the most grand of emotions; whose husband said of her piercing final novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/dec/14/fiction.features\">The Great Fire</a></em>: \u201cNo one should have to read it for the first time.\u201d There would, I assumed, be jargon of the kind that Hazzard, an autodidact who disliked modernism in most of its forms, would have loathed.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/13/shirley-hazzard-a-writing-life-by-brigitta-olubas-review-doyenne-of-love-and-devastation\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/13/sunday-with-ice-t-playing-video-games-distracts-me-from-real-life-", "title": "Sunday with Ice-T: \u2018Playing video games distracts me from real life\u2019", "date_published": "2022-11-13 06:45:03+00:00", "description": "<p>The rapper and actor on gaming, horror films and the joy of a bowl of Cheerios</p><p><strong>Up early?</strong> Since I do <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/06/law-order-svu-bends-cop-show-convention\" title=\"\">Law &amp; Order</a></em> Monday through Friday, I try to sleep in, but I naturally wake around 9am.</p><p><strong>What\u2019s for breakfast?</strong> One thing I know: in Britain, you eat baked beans for breakfast.
