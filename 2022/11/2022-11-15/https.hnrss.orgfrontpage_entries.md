<p>^ That's what our team said to me initially but we think it's pretty chill now.<p>We built a job search tool that uses investor software to help you discover the most exciting companies to work for right now.<p>Free this week so that you guys can try it out before we hard launch next week (paywall is down).<p>Feedback is our oxygen: What can we do better? Are you gonna give us money? Why do you hate the design?</p>

## Launch HN: Activeloop (YC S18) – Data lake for deep learning

<p>Hi HN, I'm Davit, the CEO of Activeloop (<a href="https://activeloop.ai" rel="nofollow">https://activeloop.ai</a>). We've made a “data lake” (industry jargon for a large data store with lots of heterogeneous data) that’s optimized for deep learning. Keeping your data in an AI-optimized format means you can ship AI models faster, without having to build complex data infrastructure for image, audio, and video data (check out our GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/activeloopai/deeplake" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/activeloopai/deeplake</a>).<p>Deep Lake stores complex data such as images, audio, videos, annotations/labels, and tabular data, in the form of tensors—a type of data structure used in linear algebra, which AI systems like to consume.<p>We then rapidly stream the data into three destinations: (a) a SQL-like language (Tensor Query Language) that you can use to query your data; (b) an in-browser engine that you can use to visualize your data; and (c) deep learning frameworks, letting you do AI magic on your data while fully utilizing your GPUs. Here’s a 10-minute demo: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxsofpSIw3k&amp;t" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxsofpSIw3k&amp;t</a>.<p>Back in 2016, I started my Ph.D. research in Deep Learning and witnessed the transition from GBs to TBs, then petabyte datasets. To run our models at scale, we needed to rethink how we handled data. One of the ways we optimized our workflows included streaming the data, while asynchronously running the computation on GPUs. This served as an inspiration for creating Activeloop.<p>When you want to use unstructured data for deep learning purposes, you’ll encounter the following options:<p>- Storing metadata (pointers to the unstructured data) in a regular database, and images in object storage. It is inefficient to query the metadata table and then fetch images from object storages for high-throughput workloads.<p>-  Store images inside a database. This typically explodes the memory cost and will cost you money. For example, storing images in MongoDB and using them to train a model would cost 20x more than a Deep Lake setup [2].<p>- Extend Parquet or Arrow to store images. On the plus side, you can now use existing analytical tools such as Spark, Kafka, and even DuckDB. But even major self-driving car companies failed on this path.<p>- Build custom infrastructure aligned with your data in-house. Assuming you have the money and access to 10 solid data engineers with PhD-level knowledge, this still takes time (~2.5+ years), is difficult to extend beyond the initial vertical, will be hard to maintain, and will defocus your data scientists.<p>Whatever the case, you'll get slow iteration cycles, under-utilized GPUs, and lots of ML engineer busywork (thus high costs).<p>Your unstructured data already sits in a data lake such as S3 or a distributed file system (e.g., Lustre) and you probably don’t want to change this. Deep Lake keeps everything that a regular data lake makes great. It helps you version-control, run SQL queries, ingest billion-row data efficiently, and visualize terabyte-scale datasets in your browser or notebook. But there is one key difference from traditional data lakes: we store complex data, such as images, audio, videos, annotations/labels, and tabular data, in a tensorial form that is optimized for deep learning and GPU utilization.<p>Some stats/benchmarks since our launch:<p>- In a third-party benchmark by Yale University [3], Deep Lake provided the fastest data loader for PyTorch, especially when it comes to networked loading;<p>-Deep Lake handles scale and long distance: we trained a 1B parameter CLIP model on 16xA100 GPUs on the same machine on LAION-400M dataset, streaming the data from US-EAST (AWS) to US-CENTRAL (GCP) [4] [5];<p>- You can access datasets as large as 200M samples of image-text pairs) in seconds (as compared to the 100+ hours it takes via traditional methods) with one line of code. [6]<p>What's free and what's not: the data format, the Python dataloader, version control, and data lineage (a log of how the data came to its current state) with the Python API are open-source [7]. The query language, fast streaming, and visualization engines are built in C++ and are closed-source for the time being, but are accessible via a Python interface. Users can store up to 300GB of their data with us for free. Our growth plan is $995/month and includes an optimized query engine, the fast data loader, and features like analytics. If you're an academic, you can get this plan for free. Finally, we have an enterprise plan including role-based access control, security, integrations, and more than 10 TB of managed data [8].<p>Teams at Intel, Google, & MILA use Deep Lake. If you want to read more, we have an enterprise-y whitepaper at <a href="https://www.deeplake.ai/whitepaper" rel="nofollow">https://www.deeplake.ai/whitepaper</a>, an academic paper at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10785" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10785</a>, and a launch blog post with deep dive into features at <a href="https://www.activeloop.ai/resources/introducing-deep-lake-the-data-lake-for-deep-learning/" rel="nofollow">https://www.activeloop.ai/resources/introducing-deep-lake-th...</a>.<p>I would love to hear your thoughts on this, especially anything about how you manage your deep learning data and what issues you run in with your infra. I look forward to all your comments.

## Ask HN: Hourly billers, do you bill for only focused work?

<p>I have noticed that trying to bill at higher rates has been becoming more difficult and if I don't work a full 8 hours it appears that I am slacking off. The vast majority of software engineers do not do 8 hours of actual work, even including meetings.<p>However, I sometimes notice other contractors billing a full 40-hour work week and clients not batting an eye.<p>Am I being too honest, and should I continue billing for the fifteen minutes I go off reading HN, having lunch, or any other short break?<p>Edit: I guess what I meant to say, is lowering my rate by around 25%, but also being less picky on what I should bill so that I can earn the same amount, acceptable?</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered about the carbon footprint of your API?<p>This week, the 27th climate summit takes place in Egypt. This inspired us to draw attention to the emissions produced by our online behaviour.<p>We introduced some CO2-related features to our API testing tool:<p><pre><code>  - Calculate carbon emissions of an API call
  - Set up a check to validate that your API endpoint doesn't cross the limit when it comes to emissions
  - Test all your API endpoints and get an approximate calculation of your API emissions in total
</code></pre>
We hope that by using these features, you will become more aware of the carbon footprint of your infrastructure and act accordingly. You could for example switch to a sustainable hosting provider.<p><a href="http://github.com/stepci/stepci" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/stepci/stepci</a></p>

<p>I am in a dilemma on which language to choose on the backend for my project. I am looking for a performant, statically-typed, systems programming language. I know C++. But C++ has become somewhat an over-engineered language that is mostly in a to-be-not-to-be state of feature development. So I looked at Rust and it already seems going in the direction of C++. So I looked at Swift, and I like what I see, but I am not sure if the language has any serious users on the server-side. IBM was one who was part of the group working on server-side features of Swift, but left the group sometime back.<p>So I was wondering if anyone here is using Swift and or Vapor for backend development?<p>What are the other alternatives, Nim?</p>

<p>Throughout my career I've held exclusively engineering positions. However, I've noticed the parts of my work I enjoy the most aren't necessarily the technical challenges, but instead improvements to process and productivity.<p>My favourite books are 'Getting Things Done' [0], and 'Deep Work' [1]. I also consistently try to find improvements to communication, requirement clarification, and decision making.<p>Is this mindset aligned with what would be expected from a COO? I know virtually nothing about the position apart from a line that stuck with me (paraphrased): 'A COO is similar to a CEO, where they have to do the same amount of work but don't get to make any of the decisions'.<p>Do you have any insights or books/article recommendations for what the role of COO looks like? It would be greatly appreciated<p>[0] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done

<p>I don't have a habit of reading news, but recently I'm thinking whether I should read or at least skim through the news title everyday, to understand better what is currently happening in my country, and in the world.<p>So I've tried a few times to skim through the homepage of those news agency, but I immediately felt overwhelmed as there were so many contents being listed out on the homepage.<p>What do you guys think?
Do you guys have a habit of reading news daily or once in a while? How do you filter out the news to read?
From which news sources?</p>

I'm only interested in laptops that I'd run Linux on, but been trying some of the late Apple MacBooks and like the hardware, just the software seems to get in the way sometimes.<p>So came across Asahi Linux project, which seems to be usable for daily work, minus some missing things.<p>But does anyone use Asahi Linux daily here and can talk about their experience?</p>

## Tell HN: Social media made me a worst person

<p>I have been an insider in one of the widely reported news item in my country, and it was a news item I would under normal circumstances take at face value, since it's politics and it's the people I support, or at least did, if not for their unequivocal support for something that I know to be not true, but reported as if, for political purposes. If I wouldn't be familiar with the details I would be inclined to believe what is reported myself.<p>It's not that I have been unaware that such bias can occur, I catch inaccuracies all the time when it comes to my own profession. I however realize that politics created a blind spot for me, along with social media, which I now increasingly rely on for news, because it's fast, and there are no nuances, like in a longer analysis, and because it's social. There is nothing like being surrounded by people who agree with you and support you in your outrage or virtue signalling, comfortably outmatching any potential detractors. Upvotes and downvotes clearly tell what's right and what's wrong, there is no uncertainty. I'm on the right side and feel good about it.<p>I can now see the effects of this on myself. I think I used to be more thoughtful, more interesting. I spoke when I had something to contribute. Not to be right. Not to have my ego satisfied. Not to pretend that I'm something that I'm not. Not to be a part of the mob. I used to think, write and read more. I used to be more creative. I used to have a richer inner life.<p>My father have died today. We weren't close. He made many mistakes in his life. He maneuvered himself into a pit of darkness, finding comfort in hate and manipulation, then mediocrity, hiding from those he wronged. He was as smart as they come, but had no empathy, to the point of psychopathy. His parents taught him that the world is his, but his pathology was too severe to help with that. He failed both as a politician and a businessman. He made many enemies. He abused his children, psychologically, physically, he beat them and starved them, kept them locked into the car for hours, for years, while doing business or cheating on his wife. He was a force to be reckoned with, the coldest and scariest, then suddenly warm with big promises. Four children had to reckon with him. One a doctor, severely alcoholic, often cruel. One with bulimia and Stockholm syndrome. Two with self-harm for a long time.<p>With this colorful background it should be clear why I don't like the type of person social media tends to create. I made this post, because I think there is an important lesson here, one I'm not quite able to elegantly express, but it goes something like this. The internet is a wonderful tool, but it can also change us for the worst. 90% of my activity on social media is a waste of time. It doesn't contribute to my life, on the contrary. Worst it doesn't contribute to your life. I would like to do that instead. Let's do that instead. Life is short. Let's make it better.<p>The news item was about my father, he died a hero. The local police made a mistake arresting him, which made him a political figure, a symbol of resistance against a tyrannical government. Celebrated by the media, he gained momentary international fame not long ago, with country leaders calling him on the phone to ensure him of their support. Now he is dead, and big, lofty political speeches are ahead about the man who couldn't ever hide who he is, except for one last time, if for a moment.</p>
