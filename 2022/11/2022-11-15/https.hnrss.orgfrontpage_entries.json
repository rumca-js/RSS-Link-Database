16:01:13+00:00", "description": "<p>Hi HN, I'm Davit, the CEO of Activeloop (<a href=\"https://activeloop.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://activeloop.ai</a>). We've made a \u201cdata lake\u201d (industry jargon for a large data store with lots of heterogeneous data) that\u2019s optimized for deep learning. Keeping your data in an AI-optimized format means you can ship AI models faster, without having to build complex data infrastructure for image, audio, and video data (check out our GitHub here: <a href=\"https://github.com/activeloopai/deeplake\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/activeloopai/deeplake</a>).<p>Deep Lake stores complex data such as images, audio, videos, annotations/labels, and tabular data, in the form of tensors\u2014a type of data structure used in linear algebra, which AI systems like to consume.<p>We then rapidly stream the data into three destinations: (a) a SQL-like language (Tensor Query Language) that you can use to query your data; (b) an in-browser engine that you can use to visualize your data; and (c) deep learning frameworks, letting you do AI magic on your data while fully utilizing your GPUs. Here\u2019s a 10-minute demo: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxsofpSIw3k&amp;t\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxsofpSIw3k&amp;t</a>.<p>Back in 2016, I started my Ph.D. research in Deep Learning and witnessed the transition from GBs to TBs, then petabyte datasets. To run our models at scale, we needed to rethink how we handled data. One of the ways we optimized our workflows included streaming the data, while asynchronously running the computation on GPUs. This served as an inspiration for creating Activeloop.<p>When you want to use unstructured data for deep learning purposes, you\u2019ll encounter the following options:<p>- Storing metadata (pointers to the unstructured data) in a regular database, and images in object storage. It is inefficient to query the metadata table and then fetch images from object storages for high-throughput workloads.<p>-  Store images inside a database. This typically explodes the memory cost and will cost you money. For example, storing images in MongoDB and using them to train a model would cost 20x more than a Deep Lake setup [2].<p>- Extend Parquet or Arrow to store images. On the plus side, you can now use existing analytical tools such as Spark, Kafka, and even DuckDB. But even major self-driving car companies failed on this path.<p>- Build custom infrastructure aligned with your data in-house. Assuming you have the money and access to 10 solid data engineers with PhD-level knowledge, this still takes time (~2.5+ years), is difficult to extend beyond the initial vertical, will be hard to maintain, and will defocus your data scientists.<p>Whatever the case, you'll get slow iteration cycles, under-utilized GPUs, and lots of ML engineer busywork (thus high costs).<p>Your unstructured data already sits in a data lake such as S3 or a distributed file system (e.g., Lustre) and you probably don\u2019t want to change this. Deep Lake keeps everything that a regular data lake makes great. It helps you version-control, run SQL queries, ingest billion-row data efficiently, and visualize terabyte-scale datasets in your browser or notebook. But there is one key difference from traditional data lakes: we store complex data, such as images, audio, videos, annotations/labels, and tabular data, in a tensorial form that is optimized for deep learning and GPU utilization.<p>Some stats/benchmarks since our launch:<p>- In a third-party benchmark by Yale University [3], Deep Lake provided the fastest data loader for PyTorch, especially when it comes to networked loading;<p>-Deep Lake handles scale and long distance: we trained a 1B parameter CLIP model on 16xA100 GPUs on the same machine on LAION-400M dataset, streaming the data from US-EAST (AWS) to US-CENTRAL (GCP) [4] [5];<p>- You can access datasets as large as 200M samples of image-text pairs) in seconds (as compared to the 100+ hours it takes via traditional methods) with one line of code. [6]<p>What's free and what's not: the data format, the Python dataloader, version control, and data lineage (a log of how the data came to its current state) with the Python API are open-source [7]. The query language, fast streaming, and visualization engines are built in C++ and are closed-source for the time being, but are accessible via a Python interface. Users can store up to 300GB of their data with us for free. Our growth plan is $995/month and includes an optimized query engine, the fast data loader, and features like analytics. If you're an academic, you can get this plan for free. Finally, we have an enterprise plan including role-based access control, security, integrations, and more than 10 TB of managed data [8].<p>Teams at Intel, Google, & MILA use Deep Lake. If you want to read more, we have an enterprise-y whitepaper at <a href=\"https://www.deeplake.ai/whitepaper\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.deeplake.ai/whitepaper</a>, an academic paper at <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10785\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10785</a>, and a launch blog post with deep dive into features at <a href=\"https://www.activeloop.ai/resources/introducing-deep-lake-the-data-lake-for-deep-learning/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.activeloop.ai/resources/introducing-deep-lake-th...</a>.<p>I would love to hear your thoughts on this, especially anything about how you manage your deep learning data and what issues you run in with your infra. I look forward to all your comments.

"description": "<p>I have been an insider in one of the widely reported news item in my country, and it was a news item I would under normal circumstances take at face value, since it's politics and it's the people I support, or at least did, if not for their unequivocal support for something that I know to be not true, but reported as if, for political purposes. If I wouldn't be familiar with the details I would be inclined to believe what is reported myself.<p>It's not that I have been unaware that such bias can occur, I catch inaccuracies all the time when it comes to my own profession. I however realize that politics created a blind spot for me, along with social media, which I now increasingly rely on for news, because it's fast, and there are no nuances, like in a longer analysis, and because it's social. There is nothing like being surrounded by people who agree with you and support you in your outrage or virtue signalling, comfortably outmatching any potential detractors. Upvotes and downvotes clearly tell what's right and what's wrong, there is no uncertainty. I'm on the right side and feel good about it.<p>I can now see the effects of this on myself. I think I used to be more thoughtful, more interesting. I spoke when I had something to contribute. Not to be right. Not to have my ego satisfied. Not to pretend that I'm something that I'm not. Not to be a part of the mob. I used to think, write and read more. I used to be more creative. I used to have a richer inner life.<p>My father have died today. We weren't close. He made many mistakes in his life. He maneuvered himself into a pit of darkness, finding comfort in hate and manipulation, then mediocrity, hiding from those he wronged. He was as smart as they come, but had no empathy, to the point of psychopathy. His parents taught him that the world is his, but his pathology was too severe to help with that. He failed both as a politician and a businessman. He made many enemies. He abused his children, psychologically, physically, he beat them and starved them, kept them locked into the car for hours, for years, while doing business or cheating on his wife. He was a force to be reckoned with, the coldest and scariest, then suddenly warm with big promises. Four children had to reckon with him. One a doctor, severely alcoholic, often cruel. One with bulimia and Stockholm syndrome. Two with self-harm for a long time.<p>With this colorful background it should be clear why I don't like the type of person social media tends to create. I made this post, because I think there is an important lesson here, one I'm not quite able to elegantly express, but it goes something like this. The internet is a wonderful tool, but it can also change us for the worst. 90% of my activity on social media is a waste of time. It doesn't contribute to my life, on the contrary. Worst it doesn't contribute to your life. I would like to do that instead. Let's do that instead. Life is short. Let's make it better.<p>The news item was about my father, he died a hero. The local police made a mistake arresting him, which made him a political figure, a symbol of resistance against a tyrannical government. Celebrated by the media, he gained momentary international fame not long ago, with country leaders calling him on the phone to ensure him of their support. Now he is dead, and big, lofty political speeches are ahead about the man who couldn't ever hide who he is, except for one last time, if for a moment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33604551\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33604551</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.abortretry.fail/p/be-is-nice-end-of-story", "title": "'Be' is nice, end of story", "date_published": "2022-11-15 02:27:28+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.abortretry.fail/p/be-is-nice-end-of-story\">https://www.abortretry.fail/p/be-is-nice-end-of-story</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33604498\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33604498</a></p>\n<p>Points: 53</p>\n<p># Comments: 20</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.archysport.com/2022/05/fencer-matthias-behr-takes-in-relatives-of-the-opponent-he-stabbed/", "title": "Fencer Matthias Behr takes in relatives of the opponent he stabbed (2022)", "date_published": "2022-11-15 00:28:06+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.archysport.com/2022/05/fencer-matthias-behr-takes-in-relatives-of-the-opponent-he-stabbed/\">https://www.archysport.com/2022/05/fencer-matthias-behr-takes-in-relatives-of-the-opponent-he-stabbed/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33603508\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33603508</a></p>\n<p>Points: 31</p>\n<p># Comments: 6</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://medispank.com/blog.html", "title": "\u0421hecking for leaked data without storing any", "date_published": "2022-11-15 00:18:47+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://medispank.com/blog.html\">https://medispank.com/blog.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33603436\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33603436</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://twitter.com/ericfrohnhoefer/status/1592287037805441024", "title": "Twitter Android app dev fired: Guess it's official now.", "date_published": "2022-11-15 00:16:37+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ericfrohnhoefer/status/1592287037805441024\">https://twitter.com/ericfrohnhoefer/status/1592287037805441024</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33603418\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33603418</a></p>\n<p>Points: 18</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/how-war-was-won", "title": "How the War Was Won", "date_published": "2022-11-15 00:16:03+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/how-war-was-won\">https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/how-war-was-won</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33603410\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33603410</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "favourite": false}]
