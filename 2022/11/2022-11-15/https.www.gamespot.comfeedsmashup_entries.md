<p dir="ltr">Sonic Frontiers' first piece of free DLC is already here, and it's a strange one. The crossover between Capcom's Monster Hunter and Sonic is perhaps one of the most unexpected we've seen this year, but there's no denying that the blue hedgehog's Rathalos costume is pretty cute.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">This collaboration pack adds a few new outfits to the game, including the Hunter's Rathalos Outfit and the Felyne's Rathalos Outfit. It also includes Monster Hunter's famous grilling minigame, which can be found at any of Big the Cat's grilling spots.</p><p dir="ltr">Some Steam reviews suggest that the grilling minigame lets you farm for fishing coins fairly effectively, so check that out if you're low. Personally, though, I think that they should've made the characteristic steak into Sonic's famous chili-dogs. Seems like a slam dunk.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-frontiers-monster-hunter-crossover-features-meat-grilling-minigame/1100-6509185/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Over the summer, David Zaslav was promoted to head of Warner Bros.

Some of them even for the first time.</p><p>Talking to RBC Capital Market Tuesday morning, Zaslav gave listeners an idea of what's to come and how he plans to get there with Gunn and Safran in charge of creative, but it's still going to take some time. He mentioned that the duo is "coming close to the end" of laying out their bible for DC and the roadmap for the next 10 years, which includes some streamlining on who plays what.</p><p>"I think over the next few years, you're going to see a lot of growth and opportunity around DC, there's not going to be four Batmans," Zaslav said (via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/david-zaslav-warner-bros-discovery-james-gunn-dc-movies-roadmap-1235262032/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>).

Sectors A1 to A20 are all connected to each other, and they each have one main item of interest called the High Value Target (HVT) and four additional items. The four standard items must be unlocked in a sector before the HVT can be unlocked.</p><p dir="ltr">The battle pass includes over 100 tiers of items, including 20 free tiers.

## How Top-Tier Time-Waster Vampire Survivors Became An Unlikely Smash Hit

<p dir="ltr">A screenshot or short video of indie hit Vampire Survivors doesn't exactly make the strongest impression. Its throwback aesthetics aren't without their charm, sure, but you might confuse it for a Castlevania fangame--its cracking whips, spinning bibles, and fluttering bats arguably fall just on the good side of copyright infringement. However, once you actually sit down and play a few minutes of this bullet hell survival game, you'll have a hard time getting back to your busy workday.</p><p dir="ltr">When that happens to you, you'll be in happy company. You can often find Vampire Survivors in Steam's best-sellers list, alongside heavy hitters like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Apex Legends.</p><p dir="ltr">Vampire Survivors belongs to a certain class of indie game that's fallen by the wayside in recent years: the time-waster. Best represented by idlers like Cookie Clicker or gambling-inspired titles like Peggle, Vampire Survivors is not a deep, taxing experience that requires hours at a time. Instead, it's designed for short play sessions of 30 minutes or so, enough to fit into your lunch break, or perhaps an empty hour in your weekend schedule.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-top-tier-time-waster-vampire-survivors-became-an-unlikely-smash-hit/1100-6509178/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Warner Bros. Discovery has released the first trailer for the third and final entry in Channing Tatum's Magic Mike series, aptly titled Magic Mike's Last Dance. With this final installment, we see Tatum's titular Mike finally in a relationship and taking the show overseas to London.</p><p>Salma Hayek joins the scantily-clad world as Mike's girlfriend who is inspired and wants to bring the show to an old theater, giving the show an almost Moulin Rouge treatment. The Oscar-nominee is replacing Thandiwe Newton, <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/04/salma-hayek-magic-mike-last-dance-thandiwe-newton-1235002023/amp/">who unfortunately had to drop out</a> for personal reasons. You can check out the trailer below.</p><div>          </div><p>The first Magic Mike hit theaters a decade ago and was loosely based on the experiences of Tatum, who actually was an 18-year-old male stripper in Tampa, Florida. The film proved to be a sleeper hit, earning over $167 million against a $7 million budget. The sequel, Magic Mike XXL was released three years later.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/channing-tatum-returns-to-magic-mike-in-one-last-dance-trailer/1100-6509179/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Phil Spencer Says Activision Blizzard Deal Is Focused On Candy Crush, Not Call Of Duty

<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has once again reiterated that the tech giant's acquisition of Activision Blizzard is more about mobile games like Candy Crush than Call of Duty.</p><p>In an interview on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel">The Verge's Decoder</a> podcast, transcribed by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/phil-spencer-says-the-xbox-business-will-become-untenable-if-it-remains-irrelevant-on-mobile/">VGC</a>, Spencer claimed that mobile gaming is seeing far higher growth than console or PC. He also admitted that Xbox has a minimal presence on mobile. He said, "Anybody who picks up their phone and decides to play a game would see that on their own."</p><p>With that absence in mind, Spencer considers it urgent for Microsoft to make a presence in the space. He said, "If we’re not able to find customers on phones, on any screen that someone wants to play on, you really are going to get segmented to a niche part of gaming that running a global business will become very challenging.” Basically, as mobile gaming grows and console gaming remains stagnant, the Microsoft's market share will shrink. He concluded that, “It’s critical that if you’re trying to run an at-scale global gaming business that you meet your customers where they want to play, and more and more, mobile is the place people want to play.”</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-says-activision-blizzard-deal-is-focused-on-candy-crush-not-call-of-duty/1100-6509176/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## How Long Is Somerville?

Somerville is the first game from the new studio Jumpship, which includes at least one former Playdead developer--that's perhaps why the eerie alien invasion story resembles Inside and Limbo. If you're wondering how long it takes to beat Somerville, our review is wrapped up so we're able to share that information. Read on to understand how long the game is, and what that means for you if you decide to chase its several alternate endings.</p><h2>How long to beat Somerville</h2><p>Somerville is a linear 2.5D adventure game that will take you <strong>approximately 4-5 hours to beat</strong>. That estimate is good for a single playthrough, however, the game offers several alternate endings and a few secrets you may wish to uncover, which could make it a bit longer.</p><p>Conveniently, the game has a very handy chapter and scene selection option in the main menu. This allows you to quickly return to specific scenes to mop up any lingering Achievements or make a different decision in the story. In our playthrough, we found three alternate endings, one of which actually ends the game much sooner than the actual last scene, and the Achievement list suggests there are more endings hiding out waiting to be discovered.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-long-is-somerville/1100-6509175/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 still has one more story to tell in 2023's upcoming Phantom Liberty expansion, and like previous premium content developed by CD Projekt Red, this DLC will have a price tag attached to it. Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-will-be-a-paid-expansion">GamesRadar</a>, CDPR's global PR director Radek Grabowski confirmed that "as for the expansion's pricing - we have not revealed exact details yet, but it will be a paid one."</p><p>This isn't a new business tactic for CDPR as the developer expanded on The Witcher 3 after launch with two well-received expansions: Hearts of Stone which cost $10 on release, and the much larger Blood and Wine DLC that retailed for $20 at the time. Like The Witcher 3--which has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-3s-free-next-gen-update-arrives-next-month-alongside-complete-edition/1100-6509117/">free next-gen update on the way</a>--Cyberpunk 2077 also received a substantial amount of free DLC after launch, with the Edgerunners update providing a notable amount of free cosmetics, weapons, and even an extra narrative thread.</p><p>Grabowski mentioned that "our expansions are traditionally cheaper than full-price games," which suggests that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phantom-liberty-is-cyberpunk-2077s-one-and-only-expansion/1100-6507165/">Phantom Liberty</a> may lean towards the Blood and Wine pricing scale as it will give players an entirely new district to explore.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-phantom-liberty-expansion-wont-be-free-dlc/1100-6509165/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Baldur's Gate 3 has been in Early Access for quite a while now, but fans will see some fresh content before the year's out.

However, its release will be accompanied by a "Panel From Hell" that will answer many of the questions that fans have posed over the past few months. The blog also features some screenshots from Larian's newly-opened motion capture studio in its Guildford branch.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps most importantly, Larian Studios states that the game is on track for a 2023 launch, which is definitely good news. Baldur's Gate 3 first came out in Early Access back in October 2020. The game's last update, Patch 8, introduced bards to the game, as well as gnomes and improved hair-shading.

Lawrence said in an interview with <a href="https://collider.com/bioshock-movie-script-status-francis-lawrence-comments/">Collider</a> that the BioShock video game series is both visually and thematically appealing, which makes it a natural fit for a film.</p><p>"There's real ideas and philosophies underneath the game property, and it's really, really, really thought out. A lot of games may have a great world of some kind, or they may have a great lead character, or they may tee you up for great set-pieces, but they don't really have the ideas, they don't have the kind of weight and the gravitas that Bioshock does," Lawrence said.</p><p>The director went on to say that BioShock has a "strange mash-up of genre," touching upon things like horror and sci-fi, as well as how it's a period piece. "I think it can be really unique and really beautiful and really entertaining" as a film, Lawrence said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-movie-director-gives-an-update-on-how-its-coming-along-and-what-to-expect/1100-6509159/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

It will also apparently feature a pretty large open world that blends the three timezones together--30km of land area to be precise--that's "seamlessly connected to a single environment offering players compelling procedurally created content that reacts appropriately to the player’s situation instead of playing preset content on repeat," according to a press release.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">The reveal was paired with an pretty lengthy gameplay trailer rather than the usual cinematic reveal, which was very purposeful.

<p dir="ltr">Despite aliens existing as one of the most prevalent enemies in video games, seldom do we get to experience them from the vantage point of ants beneath their shoes we may well be. So often, we're tasked with shooting aliens in space battles or gunning them down on the back of military vehicles, and the lack of a proper alien invasion story in the vein of Signs or Invasion of the Body Snatchers has been a personal annoyance for years. For the most part, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/somerville/">Somerville</a> finally gives us such a game, but that uncommon setup I've so looked forward to is ultimately hampered by both story and gameplay decisions that keep it from feeling impactful.</p><p dir="ltr">Created in part by a former Playdead (Inside, Limbo) developer at a new studio called Jumpship, Somerville feels similar to those milestone puzzle-adventures. The color palette favors darkness, the story unfolds without dialogue of any sort, and you'll explore by moving through a world full of threats, solving puzzles to overcome each obstacle and outrun unassailable enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">In Somerville, you play the patriarch of a family of four which also includes your wife, baby, and dog. It doesn't take long at all for the story to pick up; within minutes, you go from passing out on the couch on a typical evening at home to scrambling for shelter as otherworldly pillars rain down from the sky. Separated from your wife and child, the nameless father and his four-legged friend embark on a quest to reunite with the others.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/somerville-review-i-wanted-to-believe/1900-6417999/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The sprawling Game Boy RPG introduced the Gotta Catch 'Em All loop with a collection of 151 critters inhabiting the Kanto region. At the time, no one could have predicted that the series would become a lasting, worldwide phenomenon. Though the Pokedex has expanded significantly over the past two decades, there's no denying that the original set of 151 remain the best-known. Ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-bring-big-changes-to-the-main-series/1100-6508491/">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</a>--which will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-confirmed-pokemon-for-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-so-far/2900-4413/">add dozens of new creatures to the Pokedex</a>--we decided to take a look back on the best and most memorable Pokemon from the generation that started it all.</p><p>Our list of the 30 best Pokemon from Generation 1 includes some obvious names as well as some creatures who deserve more love than they get. It's worth noting that we cheated a bit here with the trio of starters. If we're being honest, all nine forms of your initial companion deserve to be on this list. For the sake of featuring other deserving Pokemon, we've only included their original forms. But yes, it's obvious that Charizard is one of the best Pokemon of all time.</p><p>Please be aware that we used a complex mathematical algorithm and then extrapolated those results with the help of the scientific method to choose the Pokemon for this list. So, the 30 Pokemon you'll find below are certainly the best that ever were. That's just science.</p><p>Oh, and if you're looking forward to the new Pokemon games, you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/preorder-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-for-less-than-50/1100-6508102/">preorder Pokemon Scarlet and Violet at a discount right now</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bulbasaur</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056227-genone_0019_001bulbasaur.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Pokemon's number-one hybrid plant-dinosaur mash-up, Bulbasaur's cheery face and dashing collection of tropical colors has turned this little fella into a global icon.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Charmander</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056228-genone_0018_004charmander.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>While Charmander may not have grabbed the top spot in the Pokedex, it definitely has occupied everyone's hearts with its can-do attitude, fiery design, and brilliant evolutions. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Squirtle</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056229-genone_0017_007squirtle.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>If The Pokemon Company ever finds the courage to allow us to customize our own pocket monsters the way that Arceus intended them to be, then you're damn right that I'm going to slap some sunglasses on every single member of my personal <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Squirtle_Squad">Squirtle Squad</a>.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Metapod</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056230-genone_0016_011metapod.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Since 1997, every Pokemon fan with a juvenile inner child has been snickering since Metapod used "harden" in battle. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Arbok</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056231-genone_0015_024arbok.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The chosen Pokemon of Team Rocket's Jessie for many years, Arbok just <em>looks </em>great.

Just don't let it evolve into Weezing, because that final form looks like anti-gravity misery incarnate.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Scyther</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056249-genone_0029_123scyther.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Between Scyther and Pinsir, you could say that this speedy Bug-type ninja made the final <em>cut</em>. Speedy, deadly, and perfect for that gym battle against Erica in Celadon City, Scyther is an enduring icon from Generation 1.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Electabuzz</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056250-genone_0028_125electabuzz.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Likewise, if we had to choose between one of the best pure elemental Pokemon in the original Pokedex, Electabuzz trumped Magmar thanks to its electrifying design and high-voltage personality.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Slowpoke</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056242-genone_0006_079slowpoke.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>… slow-witted Pokemon with a glazed-over look in its eyes, is one that I can strangely find common ground with.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Magikarp</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056251-genone_0027_129magikarp.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Magikarp represents potential and limitless rage, a flapping joke on dry land that required sacrifice and patience to help transform it into a kaiju-sized threat that could end civilization. This is also known as the Pokemon equivalent of Twitter. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Eevee</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056252-genone_0026_133eevee.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>For a cuter look at untapped potential, Eevee is an instant classic since day one. Sure, you could shove an elemental stone down its throat to get either Flareon or Jolteon (<em>never </em>Vaporeon), but when you've got a pocket monster that combines the best bits of DNA from dogs and cats, why would you want to ruin perfection?</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Aerodactyl</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056253-genone_0025_142aerodactyl.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>At least one prehistoric Pokemon had to pop up on this list, and that chosen revived fossil is none other than Aerodactyl. It's a beast in battle that can annihilate the unprepared. Uncovering the path to resurrect this ancient monster is still one of the most satisfying experiences in all of Pokemon.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Snorlax</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056254-genone_0024_143snorlax.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Listen, Snorlax just ate an entire forest, found a good spot to lie down, and you've rocked up with a flute solo to disturb the lovably huggable fella. No wonder he got mad at you. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Zapdos</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056255-genone_0023_145zapdos.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>With three legendary birds to choose from, finding the best one was surprisingly easy. Sure, Articuno is a debonair Ice-type and Moltres is mythical brilliance, but Zapdos could tear through either of them with its superior abilities, stats, and a design edgier than early-2000s alt-rock. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dragonite</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056256-genone_0022_149dragonite.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Dragonite felt like the first Pokemon that you had to truly earn in the game, guiding it from its larval Dratini state to its more capable Dragonair form. Getting to level 55 wasn't easy in the original Pokemon games, but once you dinged that magic number? You were gifted with an almost-unstoppable Dragonite to use in battles. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mewtwo</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056257-genone_0021_150mewtwo.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>With <em>thicc</em> thighs and psychic powers, Mewtwo was the ultimate Pokemon to acquire by the time that you had become Pokemon champion. An endgame creature dwelling within a dangerous cave outside of Cerulean City, this was the Pokemon that you'd been saving your Master Ball for. An abomination of science and hubris, having this rogue experiment on your team resulted in a serious power-up.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mew</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056258-genone_0020_151mew.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>On the other hand, having the DNA source material of Mew around earned you the ultimate kudos amongst your friends. Only available (officially) through a select number of Pokemon events, you'd have to show up in person with your Game Boy to add Mew to your collection. This charming legend was the final piece needed to complete the Pokedex.</p></h3></p><br />

## OLED Switch Draws Roughly Half The Power Of Launch Switch - Report

<p dir="ltr">Historic energy prices in Europe and other regions have many consumers wondering just how much their video game consoles cost them per year. An updated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-much-power-your-consoles-use-and-how-much-that-costs-in-the-uk">report</a> from Eurogamer suggests that the launch PS5 is still the biggest energy hog on the block, though the Xbox Series X isn't far behind. And the OLED Switch appears to be much more efficient than its launch counterpart.</p><p dir="ltr">Eurogamer partnered with Digital Foundry for this report, which tested the various functions that you might use your console for, from visually-demanding games to "rest mode." Overall, the launch PS5 was consistently biggest energy draw, from the main menu (57.4 watts) to Cyberpunk 2077 (215 to 230 watts). However, the Xbox Series X was somewhat comparable, coming in at 41.8W and 170-190W respectively for those activities. It's worth noting that some testers have reported that the PS5's first hardware revision has reduced the energy draw during heavy gaming by as much as 25-30W, which would make it more in line with the Xbox.</p><p dir="ltr">It seems that your console's "rest mode" still draws a significant amount of power--as such, we recommend turning your consoles off outright if you're particularly energy conscious. Perhaps the biggest surprise in this test is the different between the launch Nintendo Switch and its recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-oled-review-another-successful-nintendo-iteration/1100-6496821/">OLED revamp</a>. The launch Switch draws 11.2-15.1W during heavy gaming, while the OLED edition dares only 6.5-8.0W--nearly half.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oled-switch-draws-roughly-half-the-power-of-launch-switch-report/1100-6509149/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, developer Tyson Butler-Boschma uploaded a proof-of-concept demo of a Superman game that he made in Unreal Engine 5. However, while the demo has generated a lot of interest on social media, it's also been sold commercially on Steam by scammers looking to make a quick buck.</p><p dir="ltr">Butler-Boschma told <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/scammers-steal-superman-demo/">Insider Gaming</a> that the game has sold on Steam for prices ranging from $10 to $50. While the solo developer filed a DMCA takedown with Steam, Valve was slow to respond to the notice. However, the game was taken down in mid-November, after the Butler-Boschma spoke to Insider Gaming about it. He further stated that the scammers have harassed him with DMCA takedowns of their own on his YouTube channel.</p><p>Apparently, these alleged scammers have said that Butler-Boschma used to work for their company, and now he's trying to "keep everything for himself." Butler-Boschma stated that these claims are false, and that he just wants his work to remain free. He also said that he doesn't want to provide his personal information to YouTube to dispute the DMCA claims, as he fears that the scammer will use it to wreak further havoc. Now that the game has been removed from Steam, hopefully the dispute is resolved.

## Phil Spencer Can't Commit To Call Of Duty Being On PlayStation Forever, Obviously

<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has once again commented on Call of Duty's future on consoles that compete with Xbox. Speaking to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/15/23459731/microsoft-call-of-duty-playstation-phil-spencer-comments">The Verge</a>, Spencer said "there's no contract that could be written that says forever," but he expects Call of Duty to remain available on PlayStation for some time.</p><p>"It's not about at some point I pull the rug underneath PlayStation 7's legs and it's, 'Ahaha you just didn’t write the contract long enough,'" he said. "There's no contract that could be written that says forever."</p><p>Spencer said it is "a little bit silly" to write a contract that uses the word "forever," but the executive said he's open to brokering a "longer-term commitment" with Sony that it would be comfortable with. Spencer said he would also hope this deal with Sony could help appease regulators.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-cant-commit-to-call-of-duty-being-on-playstation-forever-obviously/1100-6509147/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## How Long Is Pentiment?

<p>Though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pentiment/">Pentiment</a> doesn't look like your typical pre-Black Friday game from a major publisher like Xbox Game Studios, it's maybe hitting at just the right time--after all, all the forthcoming holidays likely mean a lot of new Xbox players are joining the ecosystem. With Pentiment landing in Game Pass on day one, it could be a sleeper hit after receiving <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/pentiment">mostly positive reviews</a>. Both new players and tenured Xbox fans may be wondering: How long does it take to beat Pentiment? It's a good question given the novelty of such a game. Is it a five-hour game? A 30-hour game? The answer is actually somewhere in between, so keep reading as we explain the time investment you're in for with Obsidian's talky 2D RPG.</p><h2>How long is Pentiment?</h2><p>Pentiment is split into three acts across approximately <strong>15-20 hours</strong> of gameplay. Though it's an RPG, the world is structured in such a way that you can't do everything available to you on any given in-game day. This means that you'll necessarily miss some content--it is, in part, a murder mystery, so not all leads can be followed. It also means that multiple playthroughs can unfold differently, both between players or even if you're just reloading a save and going down a new path.</p><p>The day-night cycle of Pentiment essentially restricts your actions so that choosing to follow one lead will sometimes remove or temporarily block other opportunities. It's quite like Night in the Woods in that way, if you know that reference. As a journeyman artist turned momentary private detective, Andreas Malers can't be in two places at once, so while this isn't the sort of RPG where you'll ditch the critical path for five hours as you min-max your sorcery stats, some branches on this elaborate story tree will simply take longer to go down, hence the range of hours.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-long-is-pentiment/1100-6509134/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator/">Microsoft Flight Simulator</a> dropped its 40th anniversary update on November 11, and keen fans have already unearthed a cool new easter egg celebrating the series' long history--emulated versions of the first four games in the series, which can be played right in your virtual cockpit.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/easter-egg-lets-you-play-flight-simulator-inside-flight-simulator-2020">Eurogamer</a>, the easter egg was first picked up by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flightsim/comments/ysnkyv/found_an_easter_egg_in_the_40th_anniversary/">Redditor HughesMDflyer4</a>, who found the games hidden in the cockpit of the Diamond DA62. The easter egg is enabled by flicking the ELT switch, which then brings up the games on the cockpit's Garmin screen. Players can switch between Flight Simulator 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 using buttons at the top of the screen.</p><p>There are no restrictions on when you load up this little in-game treat, meaning you can fly a plane in one of the retro flight sim programs, while also flying your Flight Simulator 2020 plane. Already fans have used the easter egg to attempt challenges such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo9MA5a7ddM">landing planes at the same airport</a> in both games at once.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/flight-simulator-2020-easter-egg-makes-old-flight-sim-titles-playable-in-game/1100-6509141/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
