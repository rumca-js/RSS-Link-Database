<p>AI-generated art is a new frontier rife with potential. But for every thorny question about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-copyright-office-art-ai-creativity-machine-190722809.html">copyright</a> and the potential for widespread manipulation, generated art can also inspire wonder and awe. For example, look no further than <a href="https://modemworks.com/projects/op-z-stable-diffusion/">this AI-powered experiment</a> that creates kaleidoscopic visual landscapes for composed music.</p><p>A collaboration between quirky synth <a href="https://www.engadget.com/playdate-review-indie-games-crank-170054294.html">and hardware</a> brand Teenage Engineering and design studios Modem and Bureau Cool, <a href="https://teenage.engineering/now">the project</a> draws inspiration from the neurological condition synesthesia. This rare phenomenon leads the brain to perceive sensory input for several senses instead of one. For example, a listener with synesthesia may see music instead of only hearing it, observing color, movement and shape in response to musical patterns. Conversely, a synesthetic person may taste shapes, feel words from a novel or hear an abstract painting.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The audiovisual experiment uses the Teenage Engineering <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-19-teenage-engineering-op-z-review-synth.html">OP-Z sequencer</a> as the music source that is then translated into AI art. In real-time, Modem and Bureau Cool’s “digital extension” translates musical properties into text prompts describing colors, shapes and movements. Those prompts then feed into Stable Diffusion (an open-source tool similar to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-open-ai-dall-e-2-images-111840375.html">DALL-E 2</a> and Midjourney) to produce dreamy and synesthetic animations.</p><p>Modem co-founder Bas van de Poel sees the experiment as fuel for artists’ imaginations. “With the project, we see the potential for musicians to explore new forms of creativity, facilitating a joint performance between human and machine,” van de Poel told Engadget today.</p><div id="8067f593824d42a19d02016b4acdfaee"></div><p>If you’re a musician who owns Teenage Engineering’s OP-Z, you can’t yet use the extension yourself — but that may eventually change. Van de Poel tells Engadget that the companies are “exploring the potential of launching a public version.”</p><p>This AI-based project isn’t the first to bring synesthetic properties to the masses. Last year, Google Arts &amp; Culture created an exhibition that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-machine-learning-synesthesia-experiment-vassily-kandinsky-183311586.html">flipped the concept around</a>, bringing machine-learning-produced sound to Vassily Kandinsky’s paintings.</p>

<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/qualcomm"><ins>Qualcomm</ins></a> has announced its latest flagship mobile chipset, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. Along with making it more powerful and efficient than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-announcement-230024192.html"><ins>Gen 1 chips</ins></a>, Qualcomm says it has packed more AI smarts into the new platform.</p><p>The Snapdragon 8 will tap into the latest Qualcomm AI Engine and upgraded Hexagon processor to offer "faster natural language processing with multi-language translation and advanced AI camera features," the company claims. The processor has architectural upgrades that will enable up to 4.35 times the AI performance of Gen 1 chips, according to Qualcomm. There will be support for an AI precision format called Int4, which the company suggests will lead to a 60 percent performance/watt improvement over the previous-gen chipset for sustained AI inferencing. Meanwhile, the Sensing Hub will have dual AI processors, which can support features such as custom wake words.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Qualcomm notes that the upgrades will enable new camera-focused features as will. It says Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 will enhance photos and videos automatically and in real-time using semantic segmentation. This harnesses an AI neural network to make the camera aware of and individually optimize elements such as faces, hair, clothes and skies. Qualcomm has tuned the chipset to support new sensors, such as Samsung's 200-megapixel Isocell HP3. Meanwhile, this is the first Snapdragon model with an AV1 codec that supports 8K HDR playback at up to 60 frames per second.</p><p>There's an intriguing feature for mobile gamers: Qualcomm says there will be real-time hardware-accelerated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ray%20tracing/"><ins>ray tracing</ins></a>, which should improve the visuals on supported games. The company claims the latest Adreno GPU and Kyro CPU deliver over 25 percent faster performance and 40 percent more power efficiency than the Gen 1 chip. Qualcomm adds that it will offer the first mobile-optimized support for the Unreal Engine 5 Metahumans Framework, claiming that this will let players "experience photorealistic human characters in their games."</p><p>On the connectivity front, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 will use AI to manage <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/5g/"><ins>5G</ins></a> download speeds, latency, coverage and power efficiency. There will be support for dual 5G SIMs as well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wifi%207/"><ins>WiFi 7</ins></a> (with speeds of up to 5.8 Gbps). In terms of audio, phones that use the chipset will be able to offer spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, 48kHz lossless music streaming and latency as low as 48ms.</p><p>Qualcomm notes that the first phones with the Gen 2 chipset should be available by the end of the year. Partners including ASUS Republic of Gamers, Honor, Motorola, OnePlus, Oppo, Sharp, Sony, Xiaomi and ZTE plan to use the chip in their devices. There's likely to be more news from Qualcomm in the coming days, as the company is hosting its Snapdragon Summit this week.</p>

## Twitter alternatives are thriving, but not everyone can just quit

<p>It’s been less than a month since Elon Musk began his chaotic takeover of Twitter but, to many, the platform already feels like it’s entered an inevitable death spiral. Advertisers are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-losing-advertisers-boycott-193748977.html">fleeing</a>. The few remaining <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-post-hacked-152226630.htmlhttps://www.engadget.com/new-york-post-hacked-152226630.html">top executives</a> are also leaving. Musk’s Twitter Blue rollout was a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-verification-impersonation-disaster-203656712.html">complete disaster</a>. The FTC says it has “deep concern” about the company. Musk told employees bankruptcy is a real <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-bankruptcy-215850492.html">possibility</a>. Former engineers say the site could break at <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/11/08/1062886/heres-how-a-twitter-engineer-says-it-will-break-in-the-coming-weeks/">any moment</a>.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the uncertainty has inspired many users to explore Twitter alternatives. Among them, Mastodon, a decentralized platform founded in 2016, has emerged as one of the top destinations for Twitter quitters. The service saw an earlier uptick <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-alternative-mastodon-open-source-021001965.html">in April</a>, when Musk’s buyout was announced, but it’s seen an even bigger flood of new users since Musk’s takeover was completed.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Between October 27th and November 6th, Mastodon gained nearly half a million new users, almost doubling its user base, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/109300967725833789">according to</a> founder Eugen Rochko. Data <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/insights/mastodon-twitter-alternative/">from Similarweb</a>, shows that the two most popular “entry points” to Mastodon, the mastodon.social server and joinmastodon.org, are getting more than four times the amount of daily traffic compared with the end of October prior to Musk taking over the company.</p><figure><img alt="Visits to Mastodon have jumped significantly." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/5e4d4130-6525-11ed-bfcf-909e8de35b2b" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">SimilarWeb</div></figure><p>It’s not the first time upheaval at Twitter has driven new users to the “fediverse,” but it’s the largest exodus. And even many of those who haven’t quit Twitter entirely have begun promoting their Mastodon accounts.</p><p>But not everyone is ready — or able— to give up on Twitter. And many don’t see Mastodon as a viable substitute for what Twitter has provided.</p><p>For Beth Hyman, executive director of the SquirrelWood animal sanctuary in New York, Twitter has for years been a vital source of donations thanks to the rescue’s popular <a href="https://twitter.com/m_crouton">“Crouton &amp; Friends”</a> account. She began to grow SquirrelWood’s Twitter presence  in 2018 by posting nightly videos of Crouton, a baby cow living at the sanctuary.</p><p>Now, Twitter, where Crouton has more than 65,000 followers, is one of the sanctuary’s biggest, and most reliable, sources of donations. For example, she was able to raise $30,000 for a used <a href="https://twitter.com/m_crouton/status/1453854631092793348https://twitter.com/m_crouton/status/1453854631092793348">horse trailer</a> in just three days in 2021, and frequently shares other fundraisers for the sanctuary. She worries about how Twitter’s current instability could affect them. “I don't want to see the income that helps keep this sanctuary going, and all these animals fed, dry up,” Hyman tells Engadget.</p><p>She says she signed up for Mastodon as well as CounterSocial after noticing a dip in her followers in the days after Musk’s takeover, but she’s skeptical she will be able to recreate her Twitter account’s success on a new platform. “Our main home base has always been Twitter. A lot of work goes into this, and it's not like you just flip the switch and walk away and reignite it somewhere else,” she says.</p><p>She’s also found that it’s just not as easy to share photos and videos of SquirrelWood’s animals — the main draw for her social media followers — on Mastodon due to its file size constraints. “We’re taking care of 70 animals, I need something that I can do on the fly very easily,” she said.</p><div id="7497602308a5474fa4b7c602c5d92a8a"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Yup. Not leaving the Twitter. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/throwback?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#throwback</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Roo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Roo</a><a href="https://t.co/09NV6DWM8c">pic.twitter.com/09NV6DWM8c</a></p>— Crouton &amp; Friends🏳️‍🌈 (M_Crouton@mstdn.social) (@m_crouton) <a href="https://twitter.com/m_crouton/status/1587174924711493635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>For others, the decentralized nature of Mastodon has other drawbacks. Eric Feigl-Ding is an epidemiologist who grew his Twitter following at the start of the pandemic when he was <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/why-was-it-so-hard-to-raise-the-alarm-on-coronavirus.html">among the first</a> to go viral tweeting about the potential threat posed by the novel coronavirus. He now uses his Twitter account, where he has more than 700,000 followers, to share updates about the pandemic and to promote public health policy.</p><p>He says he tried to sign up for the mastodon.social server only to find that it was full, and that he and some colleagues are now debating starting their own server, But he worries he won’t be able to reach the same people as he can on Twitter.</p><p>“I knew I wanted to reach policymakers, members of Congress, and journalists, basically people who care that can move the needle on this pandemic and prepare for it,” he says. “And Twitter is that platform. Twitter is the platform to get your message out. They're not sitting on Mastodon.”</p><p>Feigl-Ding, who has spent a lot of time debunking COVID-19 misinformation, also worries about the consequences of leaving. “You do not want to cede the town square to misinformation, to disinfo, to slanted views on things,” he said. “You want to be there to engage, you want to show up at the debate.”</p><p>Others worry about losing the friendships and community they’ve formed on Twitter. Steven Aquino, a tech journalist who covers accessibility, says that Mastodon isn’t a realistic alternative for many people with disabilities because it lacks many of Twitter’s accessibility features. It also just wouldn’t be the same, he says. “The whole point of social media is to be social, and for a lot of disabled people … social [media] is how they interact with other humans,” he tells Engadget.</p><p>At the same time, the fact that Musk cut Twitter’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/04/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs/">accessibility team</a> makes him worried Twitter itself could become less usable. “The fact that they laid off the entirety of the accessibility team says a lot about what they think about people like me, and where they want the service to be,” he says.</p><p>“There’s so much being written about what Elon is doing, and hiring and firing, and those are all important things. But there is no respect for what is the real impact on the people who use the service.”</p>

## Boston Dynamics sues rival Ghost Robotics for allegedly copying its robot dog

<p>Competition in the robot dog market is getting ugly. As <em>The Robot Report</em><a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/boston-dynamics-suing-ghost-robotics-over-quadruped-design/">explains</a>, Boston Dynamics is suing Ghost Robotics for allegedly infringing seven patents linked to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-start-me-up-164722012.html">Spot quadruped</a>. The Spirit 40 and Vision 60 (shown above) purportedly borrow key technologies from Spot, including systems for self-righting and climbing stairs.</p><p>Boston Dynamics says it asked Ghost Robotics to review Spot-related patents in July 2020, five months after the launch of the Spirit 40. After that, Boston claims to have sent two cease-and-desist letters asking Ghost to stop marketing its robot canines. Ghost was thus well aware of what it was doing, according to the lawsuit.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We've asked Ghost Robotics for comment. In a statement, Boston Dynamics claimed it "welcome[s] competition" but would crack down on companies violating its intellectual property rights. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-acquires-boston-dynamics-1-1-billion-110901223.html">Hyundai-owned</a> firm is seeking unspecified damages as part of the suit.</p><p>A lawsuit like this isn't unexpected. Boston Dynamics initially focused on research, but it has increasingly turned to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-spot-kia-south-korea-factory-pilot-175729567.html">commercializing robots</a> like Spot and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boston-dynamics-selling-stretch-warehouse-robot-084529508.html">Stretch</a>. Rivals like Ghost Robotics could pose threats to Boston's still-young business, whether or not they're copying technology in the process. Even if the suit fails, it could deter other companies from making robot dogs of their own.</p>

## NYC will enforce Uber and Lyft driver pay increases by the end of the year

<p>New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has voted to increase the minimum pay rates for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/uber/"><ins>Uber</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/lyft/"><ins>Lyft</ins></a> drivers. Per-minute rates are going up by 7.4 percent and per-mile rates by 24 percent. In practical terms, that means a trip of 7.5 miles that takes 30 minutes will earn a driver at least $27.15 — an increase of more than $2.50 compared with current rates.</p><p>The commission also agreed to increase yellow and green cab fares (for the first time since 2012) by 23 percent. The new rates are scheduled to go into effect by the end of the year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Uber and Lyft pay bump is in addition to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nyc-gig-drivers-pay-increase-012304976.html">a 5.3 percent increase drivers received earlier this year</a>, the TLC confirmed to Engadget. Drivers sought higher pay amid higher inflation rates and increased operational costs.</p><p>Uber and Lyft drivers will receive another rate bump in March. The increase will be "based on inflation comparing December 2022 to September 2022," the New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA) said in a statement. The union said this was part one of a drive to ensure drivers receive at least $25 per hour in take-home pay, after expenses. "We're going to take the momentum of this driver raise which comes despite company opposition and after a long delay, and use it to power our fight for a job with dignified incomes, job security and retirement," NYTWA executive director Bhairavi Desai said.</p><p>“Raising taxi fare rates and minimum pay for high-volume drivers is the right thing to do for our city," TLC commissioner David Do said. "This is the first taxi fare increase in ten years, and these raises will help offset increased operating expenses and the cost of living for TLC-licensed drivers. We are confident that today’s unanimous commission vote will keep our taxi and [For-Hire Vehicle] fleets sustainable and ready to serve New Yorkers.”</p>

## Lucid teases its three-row Gravity electric SUV

<p>Lucid had more to show today than its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-ev-pure-touring-trim-video-140048588.html">less expensive Air models</a>. The auto startup has finally <a href="https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-gravity-reservations-open-early-2023">teased</a> its second EV, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-ev-delivery-date-214305594.html">long-in-the-making</a> Gravity SUV. The vehicle will share the swooping visual language of the Air while offering up to three rows of seating that can accommodate seven people. It should also have a next-gen version of Lucid's touchscreen-heavy cockpit, and purportedly offer more range than "any other EV" outside of the Air.</p><p>The company cautions that the Gravity design and specifications aren't final. What Lucid is showing now is largely what you'd expect, however — it's a big people-hauler with perks like a panoramic roof. As with Tesla's Model X, the three-row configuration doesn't leave much room in the back for either passengers or cargo. The rear space is "flexible," according to Lucid, so you might not be stuck if you need to carry a large load.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Lucid Gravity interior teaser" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/6a3c3bb0-651e-11ed-aff7-6b4057ee90ab" style="height: 1280; width: 1920;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lucid Motors</div></figure><p>You will be waiting a while to buy the SUV. Reservations for the Gravity open in early 2023, and it won't reach the US or Canada until 2024. Customers outside those countries will have to be more patient, and the firm hasn't disclosed pricing. It's safe to presume the EV will be expensive, though, when even the 'entry' Air starts at $87,400. This is more for customers who would otherwise consider a Model X, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqs-suv-video-100003122.html">Mercedes EQS SUV</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-3-suv-release-date-price-193711445.html">Polestar 3</a>.</p><p>The Gravity could be Lucid's most important EV to date, whatever it costs. The Air may be fast, but its sedan form factor limits its appeal in an increasingly SUV-centric market. The new model could help Lucid reach a wider audience, even if the clientele will still be limited to wealthy buyers willing to take a chance on a young brand.</p>

<p>We've finally reached the point where a robot can vacuum for us — but smart vacs aren't cheap. Eufy, from parent company Anker, makes solid and affordable robot vacuums that often go on sale. In fact, we recommend waiting until a good deal like this comes around before diving in so you can join the robot revolution while saving some cash.

It's relatively quiet, and did a good job of cleaning the carpets, only missing the occasional crumb.

Anker gives the Pascal (Pa) units to rate the suction of Eufy vacuums, and the G30 is rated to 2000pa, which is on the higher end of the spectrum (the 11S above rates at 1300Pa).

## NASA helped find a network security hole in spacecraft networks

<p>NASA and University of Michigan researchers <a href="https://news.umich.edu/cyber-vulnerability-in-networks-used-by-spacecraft-aircraft-and-energy-generation-systems/">have found</a> a security flaw that could pose a threat to spacecraft in the right (or rather, wrong) conditions. The team has discovered that time-triggered Ethernet (TTE), a feature that lets critical systems sit alongside minor ones on the same networking hardware, is vulnerable to a spoofing attack. An intruder can send fake sync messages by conducting electromagnetic interference through copper Ethernet cables into network switches, creating a "gap" in a switch's activity that lets bogus data slide through. Over time, the TTE device will lose sync and behave erratically.</p><p>The attack requires placing a small device on the network, so remote breaches are unlikely. However, the consequences could be serious. The scientists tested the vulnerability using real NASA machinery to recreate a planned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-dart-mission-smashing-success-184543626.html">asteroid redirection test</a>. In a simulation, the TTE exploit produced a knock-on effect severe enough that the crew capsule strayed from its course and missed a crucial docking procedure.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="389ce4cc87e7432eb8c88b2bee266f24"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>There are simple safeguards, if not necessarily problem-free. Vehicle designers could replace copper Ethernet with fiber optic cables or place optical isolators between switches and devices, so long as they're willing to accept sacrifices in cost and performance. Engineers could also change the network layout to prevent fake sync messages from taking the same path as legitimate ones, although that will clearly take time.</p><p>NASA and the university stress that there's no "current" known threat. However, the method could also be used to compromise aircraft, power plants and industrial control systems that rely on TTE. Theoretically, a saboteur with physical access could <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-warning-state-backed-malware-critical-infrastructure-155038012.html">disrupt critical infrastructure</a> in a way that might not be immediately obvious.</p>

## YouTube Shorts creators can now use up to a minute of licensed music

<p>In YouTube’s latest move to woo TikTok creators onto YouTube Shorts, the streaming giant announced today that short-term video creators would soon be allowed up to a minute of copyrighted music in their Shorts. The change is a significant boost from the previous 15-second limit for any licensed song.</p><p>YouTube says its short-form creators will be able to use between 30 and 60 seconds of licensed music “for most tracks.” However, some songs will remain on the previous 15-second limit, with licensing agreements determining which tracks fall in which window. Creators can quickly see how much time each song allows in the YouTube app’s audio picker. The new song-length options begin rolling out today and will continue “over the next few weeks” on iOS and Android.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As user-created videos have exploded during the past decade, aggressive DMCA takedown notices have become a headache for streamers on all platforms. Record labels often automate their copyright enforcement, leading to overzealous claims. For example, creators have seen their videos flagged for accidentally including a few seconds of copyrighted audio from a passing car’s stereo. Some police officers have even exploited the DMCA to their advantage, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cop-tried-to-use-a-taylor-swift-song-to-keep-protestor-video-off-you-tube-034515689.html"><ins>blasting Taylor Swift songs</ins></a> to prevent bystanders from sharing their legally recorded videos.</p><p>The song-limit boost is YouTube’s latest attempt to woo TikTok creators (and therefore viewers and ad dollars) onto Shorts. In September, the company announced an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-revenue-sharing-shorts-creators-170137275.html"><ins>ad-revenue sharing program</ins></a> to give qualified creators a 45 percent cut of ad revenue, regardless of whether they use music. TikTok launched a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-pulse-ad-revenue-sharing-with-creators-202611951.html"><ins>similar sharing program</ins></a> earlier this year following widespread complaints about its previous “static pool of money” approach.</p><p>YouTube’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-shorts-voiceover-narration-190351673.html"><ins>aggressive approach</ins></a> appears to be paying off, with Shorts <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-shorts-monthly-active-users-145119504.html"><ins>tallying views</ins></a> from over 1.5 billion logged-in users per month. As of September 2021, TikTok had racked up 1 billion monthly users. However, given YouTube’s overall dominance in the video space, those numbers likely include people who were already on YouTube watching other content. TikTok’s numbers, on the other hand, more clearly include people looking for its distinctive short-form videos — an audience that YouTube and other media giants like Meta are continuing to chase.</p>

## The Pacific island nation of Tuvalu is turning to the metaverse to preserve its culture

<p>With global temperatures expected to rise as much as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/un-emissions-gap-report-climate-change-warning-144323723.html"><ins>2.8 degrees Celsius</ins></a> by the end of the century, the island nation of Tuvalu says it has no choice but to build a digital version of itself. On Tuesday, Simon Kofe, the country’s foreign minister, told the COP27 climate summit Tuvalu would look to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html"><ins>metaverse</ins></a> to preserve its culture and history amid rising sea levels (via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/tuvalu-turns-metaverse-rising-seas-threaten-existence-2022-11-15/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>).</p><p>“As our land disappears, we have no choice but to become the world’s first digital nation. Our land, our ocean, our culture are the most precious assets of our people. And to keep them safe from harm, no matter what happens in the physical world, we’ll move them to the cloud,” Kofe said in a video that sees the camera slowly zooming out to reveal that he’s in front of a greenscreen recreation of his home.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At last year’s COP26 summit, Kofe famously addressed the conference standing <a href="https://youtu.be/jBBsv0QyscE"><ins>knee-deep in seawater</ins></a> to highlight the existential threat climate change poses to island nations like Tuvalu. In his latest address, the metaverse is framed as a potential home for all countries if there's not a global effort to address the problem.</p><p>“Only concerted global effort can ensure that Tuvalu does not move permanently online and disappear forever from the physical plane,” he said. “Without a global conscience and a global commitment to our shared well-being, we may soon find the rest of the world joining us online as their lands disappear.</p><p>Tuvalu is an archipelago consisting of nine islands located between Australia and Hawaii. It’s home to approximately 12,000 people. Climate scientists anticipate the entire country will be underwater by the end of the 21st century.</p><p>To achieve the 1.5C target put forward by the Paris Agreement and <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/1/19/16908402/global-warming-2-degrees-climate-change"><ins>avoid significantly worse climate outcomes</ins></a>, the world has eight years to reduce annual global emissions by a further 45 percent, compared with projections based on current policies. To limit the rise in temperatures to under 2C, an extra 30 percent reduction in emissions is needed.</p>

<p>Now might be a good moment to splurge on music-making tools. Arturia is running a <a href="https://www.arturia.com/black-friday-22">Black Friday sale</a> that offers 50 percent off its "flagship" virtual instruments, effects and software. The 33-instrument <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-v-collection-9-grows-to-32-virtual-instruments-150052024.html">V Collection 9</a> set has dropped from $599 to <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/v-collection/buy">$299</a> for newcomers, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-fx-collection-3-distortion-lo-fi-granular-effects-173429817.html">FX Collection 3's</a> 26 effects plugins are <a href="https://www.arturia.com/store/software-effects/fxcollection">$199</a> instead of the usual $399. And if you're looking for an accessible synthesizer, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-pigments-free-upgrade-soft-synth-35-m1-support-161634255.html">Pigments</a> is down from $199 to <a href="https://www.arturia.com/store/analog-classics/pigments">$99</a>. The promo runs until December 6th, and you'll get personalized offers if you already use the company's products.</p><p>We've considered these tools to be valuable even at their regular prices. V Collection 9 offers a range of pianos, classic synths and other instruments that offer substantial flexibility, including new items like a Korg MS-20 emulator and the cinematic Augmented Strings. FX Collection 3 brings vintage distortions and lo-fi effects. Pigments, meanwhile, encourages you to create synth sounds from scratch with the help of extras like a distortion module.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can use the V Collection and Pigments tools by themselves, but all of the software on sale can work with other digital audio workstations through support for formats like AAX, Audio Unit, NKS and VST. With these discounts, Arturia's audio packages could make more sense if you're either new to music production or determined to expand your toolset for the lowest price possible.</p>

## Consumer Reports finds hybrid cars are more reliable than gas-only models

<p>Hybrid cars aren't just valuable for their fuel efficiency, apparently. <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/index.htm#page=1"><em>Consumer Reports</em></a> has published annual reliability survey data indicating that hybrids are generally more reliable than their gas-only equivalents. Hybrid cars were the most reliable among vehicle types, with their SUV siblings ranking third. Certain models were stand-outs, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-maverick-2022-pickup-review-3d-printing-video-133014666.html">Ford Maverick</a> pickup, Lexus NX luxury SUV and Toyota Corolla sedan — they all had above-average reliability on top of major fuel savings.</p><p>That trustworthiness doesn't always extend to other electrified cars. The publication found that plug-in hybrids aren't as reliable. Toyota's Prius Prime and RAV4 Prime are less reliable than their conventional hybrid versions, and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chrysler-pacifica-hybrid-2018-phev-recall-irl-131527040.html">Chrysler Pacifica</a> hybrid was one of the most unreliable vehicles in the survey. EVs continue to struggle, too. While there are some exceptions, such as the "outstanding" reliability of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kias-ev-6-is-a-phenomenal-family-car-050118560.html">Kia EV6</a>, the category is still plagued with glitches — and not just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-places-last-in-jd-power-reliability-study-182453352.html">Tesla's build quality issues</a>. Ford's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fords-mach-e-is-a-stylish-and-capable-ev-but-its-no-mustang-153044259.html">Mustang-Mach-E</a> dipped to below average due to its electronics flaws. Only four out of 11 models with enough survey data had average or better reliability.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A straightforward hybrid isn't always the best choice, either. <em>Consumer Reports</em> warns that BMW, Mercedes, Ram and others offer "mild" hybrids that don't offer much in the way of fuel savings, and are sometimes focused more on adding power. These vehicles weren't included in the hybrid reliability rankings.</p><p>The greater reliability of hybrids isn't a total surprise. While they offer improved fuel economy, they're ultimately based on familiar model lines using well-established combustion engine technology. EVs are more likely to be brand new models based on young electric motor systems and don't have years of refinement.</p><p>Automakers will have to improve their safety tech if they want to stay in <em>Consumer Reports</em>' good graces, whatever powertrain they're using. As of November, the outlet will penalize models that don't include pedestrian-aware automatic emergency braking as a standard feature. <em>CR</em> will also stop handing out bonus points to vehicles that only have blind spot warnings (they'll need rear cross traffic warnings as well) and forward collision alerts. This will theoretically push car creators to strengthen their default safety packages and potentially save lives.</p>

## MIT solved a century-old differential equation to break 'liquid' AI's computational bottleneck

<p>Last year, MIT developed an AI/ML algorithm capable of learning and adapting to new information while on the job, not just during its initial training phase. These <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/machine-learning-adapts-0128">“liquid” neural networks</a> (in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJMwBwFj5nQ">Bruce Lee</a> sense) literally play 4D chess — their models requiring <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/what-is-time-series-data/">time-series data</a> to operate — which makes them ideal for use in time-sensitive tasks like pacemaker monitoring, weather forecasting, investment forecasting, or autonomous vehicle navigation. But, the problem is that data throughput has become a bottleneck, and scaling these systems has become prohibitively expensive, computationally speaking.</p><p>On Tuesday, MIT researchers announced that they have devised a solution to that restriction, not by widening the data pipeline but by solving a differential equation that has stumped mathematicians since 1907. Specifically, the team solved, “the differential equation behind the interaction of two neurons through synapses… to unlock a new type of fast and efficient artificial intelligence algorithms.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“The new machine learning models we call ‘CfC’s’ [closed-form Continuous-time] replace the differential equation defining the computation of the neuron with a closed form approximation, preserving the beautiful properties of liquid networks without the need for numerical integration,” MIT professor and CSAIL Director Daniela Rus said in a Tuesday press statement. “CfC models are causal, compact, explainable, and efficient to train and predict. They open the way to trustworthy machine learning for safety-critical applications.”</p><p>So, for those of us without a doctorate in Really Hard Math, differential equations are formulas that can describe the state of a system at various discrete points or steps throughout the process. For example, if you have a robot arm moving from point A to B, you can use a differential equation to know where it is in between the two points in space at any given step within the process. However, solving these equations for every step quickly gets computationally expensive as well. MIT’s “closed form” solution end-arounds that issue by functionally modeling the entire description of a system in a single computational step. AS the MIT team explains:</p><blockquote><p>Imagine if you have an end-to-end neural network that receives driving input from a camera mounted on a car. The network is trained to generate outputs, like the car's steering angle. In 2020, the team solved this by using liquid neural networks with 19 nodes, so 19 neurons plus a small perception module could drive a car. A differential equation describes each node of that system. With the closed-form solution, if you replace it inside this network, it would give you the exact behavior, as it’s a good approximation of the actual dynamics of the system. They can thus solve the problem with an even lower number of neurons, which means it would be faster and less computationally expensive.</p></blockquote><p>By solving this equation at the neuron-level, the team is hopeful that they’ll be able to construct models of the human brain that measure in the millions of neural connections, something not possible today. The team also notes that this CfC model might be able to take the visual training it learned in one environment and apply it to a wholly new situation without additional work, what’s known as <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/out-of-distribution-generalization-66b6f8980ef3">out-of-distribution generalization</a>. That’s not something current-gen models can really do and would prove to be a significant step towards the generalized AI systems of tomorrow.</p>

<p>Budding beatmakers (or musicians looking to add to their toolset) might be interested in checking out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ableton/"><ins>Ableton's</ins></a> Black Friday deals. The company has slashed the price of its Live packages, the Push controller and sound packs <a href="https://fave.co/3NAUwrZ?uuid=ZbvWZ8kfLmc7QQNt0386"><ins>by 20 percent</ins></a>. While that isn't quite as generous as the 25 percent discounts we've seen from Ableton in the past, the company doesn't often run sales. So, if you've been eyeing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ableton-live-11-apple-m1-chip-native-support-180847297.html">Live 11</a>, one of the most popular digital workstations (DAWs) around, for a while, now might be the time to take the leap. You'll have some time to think about it, though, as the deals run through January 11th.</p><p>The base Live 11 Intro option is down from $99 to $79 for the time being. It has what you need to get started with the DAW, including more than 1,500 sounds, 21 audio effects and 11 MIDI effects.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you're ready for something more full featured, consider the Live 11 Standard package, the price of which Ableton has lowered from $449 to $359. The bundle includes unlimited audio and MIDI tracks, as well as unlimited scenes and more than 1,800 sounds.</p><p>At the top end is the Live 11 Suite, which is down from $749 to $599. You'll get access to more than 5,000 sounds, along with more audio and MIDI effects and extra software instruments. Current Live users can get 20 percent off upgrades too.</p><p>Meanwhile, it's rare to see Ableton offering a discount on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-03-24-ableton-push-review.html"><ins>Push controller</ins></a>, which has deep integration with Live. In fact, the company confirmed to Engadget this is the first time it has cut the price of the controller since 2016.</p><p>You'll be able to use Push to play and tweak samples, step sequence your creative ideas and record your creations. If you don't already own Live 11 but want to pick up Push, you'll need to buy them as a bundle. The Live Intro 11 and Push package costs $639 (down from $898). Live 11 and the controller will set you back $918 (was $1,248). As for the bundle of Live 11 Suite and Push, that will run you $1,118 (down from $1,548). Current Live owners will see their Push price after logging into their account, but based on the bundle prices, it should be around $560.</p><p>Ableton allows customers to spread the cost of Live or Push over six months at the discounted rate. Meanwhile, students and teachers can save up to 40 percent off the standard price.</p>

## Descript's text-based video editor now lets you write scripts as you go

<p>Descript aims to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/descript-video-editing-audio-screen-recordings-181143665.html">simplify video editing</a> by making it a matter of tweaking transcripts, but now you don't even need to have ready-made audio. The company has <a href="https://www.descript.com/blog/article/all-new-descript-backed-by-openai-startup-fund">redesigned</a> Descript with a new interface that includes a writing tool. You can write a script in Overdub on the fly and either use text-to-speech to vocalize your narration or replace it with your own recording later. This could mainly be helpful if your content doesn't have any spoken-word material, but it might also come in handy if you're not comfortable speaking.</p><p>The app as a whole now centers on "Scenes," or distinct visual segments (pictured above). You effectively treat moments in a video like you would slides in a presentation, with each getting its own overlays and titles. The concept is potentially easier to grasp than working with a conventional video editor's timeline. Accordingly, there are now templates with ready-made layouts, title sequences and social clips.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="a3d09e14c1df436dbd5e0fcb086327d2"></div><p>Other additions revolve more around features you might expect from established media editing tools. The Descript recorder is now built into the editor, with separate tracks for your screen and the camera. Color control lets you modify elements like exposure and white balance, while AI-powered chroma keying allows to remove backgrounds like you would using a green screen. And if you need a pre-made soundtrack or B-roll footage, you now have access to stock media from providers like Giphy, Storyblocks and Unsplash.</p><p>The new Descript is available now for Macs and Windows PCs. How much you'll pay depends on how you intend to use it. The tool is free for three hours of transcription and other core features, but you'll need to pay $12 per month for watermark-free video exports and 10 hours of transcription. Heavy-duty users will want to spend $24 per month to get unlimited Overdub, 30 hours of transcription per month and pro versions of tools like Audiograms and filler word removal.</p><p>As before, Descript makes the most sense if you're working with either dialogue-heavy videos or podcasts. You may still want to stick to a conventional timeline-based editor to produce the next great movie or TV show. However, the new version may be appealing if you need to produce a reasonably polished video in a hurry.</p>

<p>After announcing it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-revenue-sharing-shorts-creators-170137275.html">share ad revenue</a> with Shorts creators earlier this year, YouTube is experimenting with new revenue streams for the service. The platform plans to introduce TikTok-like shopping features to Shorts, allowing users to shop directly for products promoted by influencers through links in videos, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8a155d40-bc71-411a-bbb6-a3a1044a15ac"><em>The Financial Times</em></a> has reported.&nbsp;</p><p>YouTube plans to roll out two separate schemes starting in 2023. The first is an affiliate marketing system that would pay a commission to select US-based creators who promote products.

All of that in on top of the aforementioned system that will see creators take a 45 percent share of ad revenue starting early next year</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>"It is very much an endorsement model, versus a more traditional advertising model or a paid-placement model," YouTube Shopping's GM Michael Martin told the <em>FT</em>. "Our goal is to focus on the best monetization opportunities for creators in the market."</p><p>YouTube's Shorts channel, which recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23427585/youtube-shorts-videos-live-tabs-channels">got its own tab</a>, now has 1.5 billion monthly users, surpassing the 1 billion users <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bytedance-tiktok-1-billion-monthly-active-users-154034999.html">now on TikTok</a>. Despite that success, though, Alphabet revealed in its last earnings report that YouTube ad sales revenue was down and missed expectations.</p><p>As such, YouTube is experimenting with new sources of revenue already being exploited by TikTok and Meta. However, the endorsement approach hasn't worked as well in the US as other countries, so YouTube plans to focus its direct shopping schemes in markets where it has worked, like South Korea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Lucid Air is a fantastic first car from a new automaker. It’s also a very expensive EV out of the reach of most people. The company has promised less expensive versions of the Air and today those vehicles are finally being unveiled.</p><p>During the Los Angeles auto show, Lucid took the wraps off the Lucid Air Pure and Touring. The two vehicles might not hit 60 in under two seconds, but these are likely the trim levels that will dominate the automaker’s sales.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Pure is the first and only Air to come in under $100,000 starting at a still pricey $87,400. It’s best to remember that the Air is still a luxury vehicle. While it won’t hit 500 miles between charges, it has an EPA target of 410 miles and can charge at 250kW on a compatible DC fast charger.</p><p>The Touring is slightly more expensive at $107,400 and can drive for an EPA estimated range of 425 miles.</p><p>While the Pure wasn’t quite ready for testing, we were able to get behind the wheel of the Touring for a quick jaunt around the Lucid headquarters. Watch the video below for the full story.</p><div id="117ea485ff934162a47fd0a88ced90eb"></div><p></p>

## NVIDIA RTX 4080 review: A (slightly) more practical 4K gaming titan
 - [https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4080-review-more-practical-4k-gaming-titan-140009349.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4080-review-more-practical-4k-gaming-titan-140009349.html?src=rss)

<p>Sure, we all want NVIDIA's RTX 4090, but it's tough to stomach its $1,599 starting price (if you can even find it at that price) or its massive power demands. That leaves impatient PC gamers with only one other new NVIDIA option this year: the $1,199 RTX 4080 with 16GB of VRAM. While $400 isn't exactly a huge discount in the world of high-end PC gaming (certainly not as significant as the $899 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-cancels-12gb-geforce-rtx-4080-launch-174717906.html">12GB RTX 4080 that NVIDIA "unlaunched."</a>), it may tempt some gamers.</p><p>After all, it's faster than the RTX 3080 Ti that launched at the same price earlier this year, and it works with NVIDIA's powerful new DLSS 3 upscaling technology (which is limited to 4000-series GPUs). If you can live without the bragging rights of having a 4090, the RTX 4080 is a powerful GPU that'll satisfy anyone who wants to game in 4K with ray tracing. For those stuck with lower resolution monitors, though, you're probably better off waiting for the eventual 4070 and 4060 cards, as well as AMD's upcoming RDNA 3 GPUs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Surprisingly enough, the RTX 4080 Founders Edition we reviewed shares the exact same design as the 4090. They both take up three PCI-e slots, sport massive vapor chambers, and they retain the unique pass-through fan design from NVIDIA's previous GPUs. I was expecting something a bit smaller, to be honest. At least the 4080 only needs three 8-pin PSU cables to function, whereas the 4090 demands four. (Both cards can also be powered by a single PCIe 5.0 PSU cable, but those power supplies are pretty rare at the moment.)</p><figure><img alt="NVIDIA RTX 4080" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/ddcacbb0-64a5-11ed-adfe-8c8a2427ee22" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>The 4080's power cables also hint at one of its major advantages: It has a 320-watt thermal design profile (TDP) and requires a 750W PSU, whereas the 4090 has a far more demanding 450W TDP. Unless you already have an 850W power supply, upgrading to the 4090 may involve getting a new unit and rewiring power throughout your entire system. These cards won't always use their maximum power loads, but you'll still need to be ready for the rare moments when they need more juice.</p><p>While it may look just like the 4090, the RTX 4080 is a dramatically different beast under the hood. It's powered by 9,728 CUDA cores, 16GB of GDDR6X VRAM and offers a base clock speed of 2.21GHz (with boost speeds to 2.51GHz). The 4090, on the other hand, has 16,384 CUDA cores, slightly higher clock speeds and a whopping 24GB of VRAM. Compared to the 3080 Ti,  the 4080 wins out with NVIDIA's new Ada Lovelace architecture, significantly faster speeds and 4GB more VRAM. (The 3080 Ti technically has around 500 more CUDA cores, but they're also inherently slower and less efficient than NVIDIA's new platform.)</p><section><img alt="NVIDIA RTX 4080" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/ddcb8f00-64a5-11ed-b57f-5b3219477b06" /></section><p>So what do these numbers mean in practice? The RTX 4080 scored around 3,500 fewer points in 3DMark's TimeSpy Extreme benchmark compared to the 4090. But if that more powerful card didn't exist, the 4080 would be the most capable GPU we've ever reviewed. Its TimeSpy Extreme score was about 50 percent higher than the 3080 Ti, and it reached a comfortable 130fps while playing <em>Halo Infinite</em> in 4K with all of its graphics settings maxed out. Seeing <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>hit 74fps in 4K with ultra ray tracing settings (and the help of DLSS 3) nearly brought a tear to my eye.</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>None</p></td><td><p>3DMark TimeSpy Extreme</p></td><td><p>Port Royal (Ray Tracing)</p></td><td><p>Control</p></td><td><p>Blender</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NVIDIA RTX 4090</p></td><td><p>12,879</p></td><td><p>17,780/82fps</p></td><td><p>4K (Native) High RT: 42 fps</p></td><td><p>9,310</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NVIDIA RTX 3090</p></td><td><p>16,464</p></td><td><p>25,405/117.62 fps</p></td><td><p>4K (Native) High RT: 107 fps</p></td><td><p>12,335</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti</p></td><td><p>8,683</p></td><td><p>12,948/59.95fps</p></td><td><p>4K (Native) Med RT: 43 fps</p></td><td><p>5,940</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</p></td><td><p>7,713</p></td><td><p>9,104/42.15fps</p></td><td><p>4K (Native) No RT: 28-40 fps</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>A word on DLSS 3: It's NVIDIA's latest AI solution that can take lower-quality imagery and upscale it to higher resolutions. But in addition to intelligently sharpening edges and upgrading textures, DLSS 3 can also inject interpolated frames to smooth out 4K gameplay. While I can occasionally spot issues with particularly low quality DLSS upscaling, I didn't notice any unusual framerate hiccups while testing <em>Cyberpunk</em> and <em>A Plague Tale: Requiem</em> with the technology enabled.</p><p>The only real downside to the RTX 4080 is that I can't help but compare it to the 4090. That same <em>Cyberpunk</em> ray tracing benchmark was almost twice as fast on the 4090, reaching an eye-watering 135 fps. It also hit a 40-fps-higher average framerate in the 3DMark Port Royal ray tracing benchmark. Still, these are the sorts of gains only the most dedicated gamers will notice, the exact market for the 4090. When it comes to actual 4K gameplay, even with ray tracing in demanding games like <em>Control</em>, I never felt held back by the RTX 4080.</p><figure><img alt="NVIDIA RTX 4080" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/ddca7d92-64a5-11ed-beff-aad2dab48e82" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>And if you're looking for more performance, overclocking is always an option. I didn't have a chance to do so myself, but the 4080's thermal performance makes me think there's plenty of room for pushing things harder. It never climbed beyond 61 celsius during my testing, around 10 degrees cooler than the 4090. That's a testament to NVIDIA's excellent cooling setup (and perhaps partially due to my office being slightly cooler this month).</p><p>The real question: Is it worth settling for the 4080 if there's a chance you'll actually be able to buy the 4090 for $1,599? At the moment, most online retailers are selling 4090 cards for well above $2,000. It sounds crazy to say it, but the $1,199 card seems like a steal with that gulf. But, of course, who knows how long you'll be able to find the RTX 4080 at its launch price. It likely won't be too long before it creeps towards the 4090's higher tag.</p><p>And if paying more than $1,000 for a video card seems insane to you — and let's be clear, <em>it should</em> — sit tight to see what NVIDIA's future cards look like. We're definitely expecting RTX 4070, 4060 and 4050 cards eventually, but the the question is <em>when</em>. (Also, what the heck will NVIDIA do with its planned $899 4080 GPU? Does that become the 4070?) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-rdna3-gpu-radeon-7900-xtx-7900-xt-202134224.html">AMD's flagship RDNA 3 GPUs</a> will launch below $1,000, and at the entry level, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-arc-a750-a770-review-mid-range-gpu-rivals-nvidia-amd-130032507.html">Intel's new Arc GPUs</a> are surprisingly compelling.</p><p>All in all, the RTX 4080 is exactly what I'd want from an RTX 3080 Ti successor. It's faster and has plenty of new features to make it a demonstrable leap from the previous cards. I'm not saying you should be upgrading your 3080 anytime soon, but if you somehow stumble onto $1,199, I wouldn't blame you for being tempted by the 4080.</p>

While we did see them $10 cheaper during Amazon's October Prime Day, this remains a great sale price that doesn't come around very often.</p><p></p><p>These buds are a bit old at this point, but any AirPods are hard to beat if you live within the Apple ecosystem. The second-gen buds pair almost instantly with your iPhone during setup, and then they'll switch seamlessly between other Apple devices as you use them. That means you can go from taking a call on your iPhone to listening to music from your MacBook without any hiccups. Apple's H1 chip inside the AirPods also enables hands-free Siri access, allowing you to call upon the virtual assistant to answer questions, send messages and do other tasks without touching your AirPods at all.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unlike the AirPods Pro, the standard AirPods have a fit that's akin to Apple's old-school EarPods, so if you always liked those that used to come with new iPhones, you'll probably like the fit of these buds, too. Sound quality is decent and wireless connectivity has been improved since the original versions of the buds. As far as battery life goes, you'll get five hours of listening time on a single charge, and a total of 24 hours of use when you employ the charging case that comes with the buds. Just keep in mind that these AirPods do not come with a wireless charging case, so you'll have to power them up with a Lightning cable.</p><p>The most compelling reason to pick up the second-gen AirPods is their sale price.

## ‘Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty’ will be a paid DLC

<p>Back in September, CD Projekt Redc (CDPR) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-2023-expansion-details-173434698.html">announced</a> that it's going to release an expansion for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> entitled <em>Phantom Liberty</em> that would add characters and a new location to the game. Now, the developer has confirmed that you'll have to pay for the DLC when it drops and if you want to see what's new in Night City. CDPR's global PR director Radek Grabowski told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-will-be-a-paid-expansion/"><em>GamesRadar+</em></a>: "As for the expansion's pricing — we have not revealed exact details yet, but it will be a paid one." Grabowski also told the publication that the developer's expansions are "traditionally cheaper than full-price games." To note, <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>cost $60 when it launched.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Phantom Liberty</em> will be a spy thriller and will involve espionage work for the New United States of America. It will star the game's main protagonist V and Johnny Silverhand, the popular <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> character played by Keanu Reeves. When it first announced the DLC, CDPR said that it was only going to be released for the Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 5 and PC. It will skip the PS4 and the Xbox One altogether, which perhaps isn't surprising, considering the issues the developer faced upon the main game's release.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you'll recall, the game's launch was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-glitch-penis-breasts-170449946.html">marred by</a> bugs and glitches — some even prevented players from completing quests and moving forward. Its performance was especially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-old-gen-console-update-084159446.html">poor on older-generation consoles</a>, prompting the developer to issue a statement that promised to roll out fixes that would make the game playable. The issues were so bad, Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-bugs-playstation-xbox-refund-removed-183051405.html">pulled the game from the PlayStation Store </a>and offered refunds to anybody who asked for one. That said, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was able to get past its buggy launch, thanks to CDPR rolling out a stream of patches, as well as to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-netflixs-cyberpunk-2077-anime-series-trailer-085217619.html">release of a Netflix anime</a>. In October, the developer announced that it's going to work on a sequel to the game codenamed "Orion," which will "further develop the potential" of the sci-fi franchise.</p>

## Apple lets you practice sending emergency SOS texts via satellite in new demo mode

<p>One of the most noteworthy updates Apple brought to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-14-review-camera-test-sample-pictures-notch-specs-battery-life-130022134.html">the iPhone 14</a> series this year is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-14-emergency-sos-satellite-connection-183230405.html">Emergency SOS via satellite</a>. It lets you send text messages to emergency services over satellite if you're in need of help and outside of cellular coverage. The company hopes you don't <em>need</em> to use the service, but in case you find yourself hurt and needing rescue in the wilderness, it can be frustrating if you're unfamiliar with a tool you were expecting to be helpful. Today, Apple is rolling out a demo mode of Emergency SOS via Satellite so members of the public can see how it works.</p><p>After updating your iPhone 14 (or 14 Plus or 14 Pro or 14 Pro Max), you'll need to navigate to the Emergency SOS section of Settings to find the Demo. It's worth checking this out since not many people will know what to expect nor that the first step is to dial 911, instead of looking for an app. If you're using demo mode, you won't be connected to a real emergency services agent or relay center — the company's system will navigate demo users to a server that sends canned responses. This prevents people from overloading actual call centers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to a controlled preview at Apple's campus earlier this year, I also tried the satellite communications feature for myself at a special demo last week in Brooklyn's Prospect Park. Using iPhones that Apple tweaked to disable cellular services, I was able to locate and connect to passing satellites and experience how long it would take to have a text conversation with an agent. Not only was it insightful to get a sense for how much slower satellite transmissions took compared to cellular, I also learned how best to concisely convey information about my situation in as few words as possible.</p><p>Apple doesn't recommend that you try this yourself (i.e. find a place without any cellular coverage just to see what the experience is like). Instead, if you're curious about the interface and how this works, that's what this demo mode is for.</p><p>Emergency SOS via Satellite and the demo mode both roll out today in the US and Canada. Apple is also announcing that it's expanding the service to France, Germany, Ireland and the UK in December.&nbsp;</p>

## Amazon Clinic is a virtual healthcare service over text chat

<p>Amazon has <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/what-is-amazon-clinic">launched</a> a new virtual health service that gives you a way to consult healthcare professionals for common conditions and get prescriptions for them without heaving to make a video call. This new product is called <a href="https://clinic.amazon.com/">Amazon Clinic</a>, and it offers a text-based solution that connects you with third-party virtual care options. You can choose among Amazon's partner telehealth providers, but the purpose of your consultation has to be in the service's list of accepted conditions, which include acne, hair loss, acid reflux, pink eye, sinusitis and UTI. You can also use the service to get prescription renewals for conditions like asthma, high blood pressure and migraine.&nbsp;</p><p>This is but the latest product Amazon has introduced in its bid to delve deeper into the healthcare sector. The e-commerce giant launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-pharmacy-134356646.html">Amazon Pharmacy</a> to deliver discounted prescription medicine to Prime members in 2020, and it entered a deal to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-primary-healthcare-provider-one-medical-acquisition-140426086.html">purchase</a> primary healthcare company One Medical for $3.9 billion in July. Amazon used to offer an app-based telehealth service called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-care-telehealth-app-healthcare-expansion-155308198.html">Amazon Care</a> to its employees and other companies across the US, but it was shut down by the end of September. According to a previous <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/08/24/amazon-care-telehealth-shutting-down/"><em>Washington Post</em></a> report, company senior vice president of health Neil Lindsay told employees that while "enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers [the company has] been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unlike Care, Clinic wasn't designed to be an enterprise offering. At the beginning of your consultation on the service, you'll have to select your condition and choose your preferred provider from the list of partners before answering a short questionnaire. You'll then be connected to a secure messaging portal where you can chat with a healthcare professional, who'll send you a personalized treatment plan. They can also send your preferred pharmacy — one of the options, of course, is Amazon Pharmacy — any necessary prescriptions. You'll remain connected to your healthcare professional for up to two weeks after your initial chat, and you can send them follow-up messages within that time.&nbsp;</p><p>While the service doesn't accept insurance right now, you can pay with an FSA or HSA debit card or get your receipt reimbursed when possible. You do have to pay a flat fee upfront, which is dependent upon your condition. Amazon says that the cost of care is equivalent or less than the average copay in many cases. As for medication, coverage varies, but you can use insurance to pay for it. Amazon Clinic is only available in 32 states at the moment, though the company is hoping to expand its reach to additional states over the coming months.&nbsp;</p>

## The Morning After: Nike's .Swoosh is its big blockchain idea

## FTX implosion could affect 'more than one million' investors

<p>Bankruptcy documents <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftx-bankruptcy-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-resigns-155552534.html">filed by the crypto exchange FTX</a> indicate that it currently faces more than 100,000 creditors, but that number could expand to over one million, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6a0ea717-b57e-44de-abf3-054523855172"><em>The Financial Times</em></a> has reported. The company also stated that it has been in contact with US federal prosecutors, as well as "dozens of federal state and international regulatory agencies" over the last few days.&nbsp;</p><p>FTX filed for bankruptcy last week following the sudden collapse of its exchange. Today, the Securities Commission of The Bahamas said it had received court approval to appoint two partners from the Bahamas and Hong Kong to oversea the unwinding of FTX Digital Markets, a key part of FTX. The filing called the state of affairs "unprecedented," noting that "barely more than a week ago, FTX, led by its co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was regarded as one of the most respected and innovative companies in the crypto industry."&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, the Royal Bahamas Police confirmed yesterday that they were working "to investigate if any criminal misconduct occurred," according to the<em> FT</em>. The day after the bankruptcy was filed, the company reported that millions of dollars went missing from crypto wallets following "unauthorized transactions." In addition, at least $1 billion worth of customer funds vanished from FTX prior to that.</p><p>FTX's troubles started after the price of its native FTT token plunged and numerous users withdrew their cryptocurrency. After it was reported that FTX was facing a liquidity crisis, rival Binance said it would sell off around over $500 million worth of FTT, all but wiping out the token's value. Binance then said it would take over FTX, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/binance-abandons-ftx-rescue-bid-222642965.html">backed out of the deal</a> a day later, citing concerns that emerged while carrying out due diligence. Bankman-Fried said he plans to eventually <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1591089330323611648">publish</a> an account detailing exactly what happened to FTX.</p>

## Opera's desktop browser now includes fast access to TikTok

<p>Opera's fondness for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/opera-built-in-instagram-073053226.html">building social networks into its browser</a> now extends to what's arguably the hottest platform at the moment. <a href="https://www.opera.com/browsers/opera">The company</a> has updated its desktop browser with quick access to TikTok through the sidebar. You're ultimately accessing the web version anyone can use, of course, but this is still helpful if you want to quickly check your feed at work (especially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-time-limit-10-minutes-174130936.html">longer clips</a>) or upload edited videos from your computer.</p><p>The addition joins fast access to Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. You also have access to a media player sidebar with access to services like Apple Music and Spotify. These are again web apps, but Opera is clearly hoping to reel in users who'd rather not run separate native apps or switch browser tabs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="de7317a529414d7598a725b7e75adf4f"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The TikTok feature is ultimately an extension of a familiar strategy. As with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-11-opera-built-a-browser-just-for-gamers.html">gaming</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/opera-is-making-a-dedicated-crypto-browser-112602524.html">crypto browsers</a>, Opera is hoping to draw you away from the likes of Chrome and Safari by integrating <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-20-opera-vpn-browser-available-to-everyone.html">useful</a> (or at least trendy) services into its client. When all modern browsers tend to perform well, Opera effectively argues, why not use one that might be more convenient?</p><p>It's not certain how well that approach is working for the company's bottom line. Opera has <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-201910-202210">gained share</a> in the past few years, climbing from just under 2.3 percent in Statcounter's October 2019 rankings to nearly 3.6 percent three years later. However, it remains a distant fifth and is competing more with Firefox (just over 7 percent share) than Chrome (66.5 percent). If anything, Opera is establishing itself more as the go-to option for those tired of what Apple, Google and Microsoft have to offer.</p>

## Twitter fired employees who publicly called out Elon Musk

<p>At least three Twitter employees who survived the mass layoffs that cut the company's workforce in half have been fired after calling out their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html">new boss</a> on the platform. One of them is Eric Frohnhoefer, who responded to Elon Musk's tweet apologizing for Twitter being slow in many countries. "App is doing &gt;1000 poorly batched RPCs just to render a home timeline!" Musk wrote. Frohnhoefer <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1592186302379982849">responded</a> that after six years of working on Twitter for Android, he can say that Musk's statement "is wrong."&nbsp;</p><p>The multi-company executive then <a href="https://twitter.com/EricFrohnhoefer/status/1592010924017258498?s=20&amp;t=J1KJTJuInGBwivqrEfGFpw">asked</a> him what the right number was and what has he done to fix Twitter for Android, which has been "super slow." He replied with the work his team has done for the app and <a href="https://twitter.com/EricFrohnhoefer/status/1591968783148920832">listed</a> a few reasons on why it's slow: "First it's bloated with features that get little usage. Second, we have accumulated years of tech debt as we have traded velocity and features over perf. Third, we spend a lot of time waiting for network responses."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Their exchange went on in several threads, and when one user told Frohnhoefer that he should've informed his boss privately, he <a href="https://twitter.com/EricFrohnhoefer/status/1591990727852298245">replied</a>: "Maybe he should ask questions privately. Maybe using Slack or email." After that, Musk informed everyone on Twitter that Fronhoefer had been fired.</p><div id="aab30751651548bead97af1f8e2ae7f9"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">He’s fired</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1592186302379982849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>The former Twitter app engineer told <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cyrusfarivar/2022/11/14/musk-fires-twitter-engineer-on-twitter-cowards/?sh=101f24a06063"><em>Forbes</em></a> that he had gotten no communication from Twitter about his dismissal and that his laptop "just shut off." He added that "[n]o one trusts anyone within the company anymore," so it's been hard to function. The former Twitter employee also said that before Musk took over, "people were more open and felt that they could criticize and now that’s clearly not the case."</p><p>Another engineer named Ben Leib was also fired, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-14/musk-publicly-punishes-twitter-engineers-who-call-him-out-online?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> has confirmed. Leib also responded to the same apology tweet by Musk, <a href="https://twitter.com/bgleib/status/1591875679377031169">saying that</a> as a former "tech lead for timelines infrastructure at Twitter," their new owner had no idea what he was talking about. And then there's Sasha Solomon, a tech lead for the company who chimed in with her own response to the same Musk tweet and who later <a href="https://twitter.com/sachee/status/1592308273071681536">announced</a> that she, too, got fired.</p><div id="d8b4513a00df4ba58d807c8d37b68b66"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">you did not just layoff almost all of infra and then make some sassy remark about how we do batching <br /><br />like did you bother to even learn how graphql works <a href="https://t.co/eUhZuZZyid">https://t.co/eUhZuZZyid</a></p>— sachee@macaw.social (@sachee) <a href="https://twitter.com/sachee/status/1591857120768843776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>There have been massive changes over at Twitter after Elon Musk officially purchased the company. He immediately dismissed its top executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-layoffs-010148183.html">ordered mass layoffs</a> that saw around 50 percent of the social network's employees lose their jobs. Twitter also launched the $8-a-month Blue subscription that provided everyone who can pay access to instant verification. Making the blue checkmark easy to obtain, however, led to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-verification-impersonation-disaster-203656712.html">rise in impersonation and legitimate-looking fake accounts</a> on the website.&nbsp;</p>
