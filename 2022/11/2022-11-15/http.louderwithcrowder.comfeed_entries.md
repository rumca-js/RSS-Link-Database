Exhibit Q is this specimen. She not only sh*ts on her father while eulogizing him and his funeral, but is so proud of herself that she posted it on her TikTok page. Her dad's sin? <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jennifer-lawrence-politics-family-members" target="_blank">Being a white Trump supporter</a>, along with all the other -ists and -isms someone with pronouns in their bio throws at anyone who has a different opinion than them.</p><p>This video was found by citizen journalist Libs of TikTok.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">This woman went viral on TikTok for disparaging and belittling her white father at his funeral. <br /><br />She says she won‚Äôt miss him because he‚Äôs a ‚Äúracist, Trump-loving, cis straight white man.‚Äù <a href="https://t.co/zxJfFlI0Ug">pic.twitter.com/zxJfFlI0Ug</a><br />‚Äî Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) <a href="https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1592604649995268097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>These two lines stand out:</p><blockquote>What you are is a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, Trump-loving straight white man.</blockquote><blockquote><span></span><em>I refuse to stand up here and sing the praises of a man who was </em><em>the paradigm of white supremacy</em><em>.</em></blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>This video will anger others. It's hard to believe her dad was such a bad person that he also happened to check off every label leftists throw at people who have any opposing viewpoint from them. The same words that the left has so abused assigning to anyone who voted for Trump, they've lost all meeting. </p><p>I really just feel sad for her. She'll get the attention she's looking for. First from her Marxist colleagues whose very being is in teaching people to judge others --<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dad-wife-school-district-evil" target="_blank"> including their own parents</a> -- by <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/loudoun-county-mother-daughter" target="_blank">the color of their skin</a>. Then she'll get attention playing the victim when others leave disagreeable comments about the content she chose to put on the internet. </p><p>Then she is going to realize she doesn't have a dad anymore and, like the rest of us who don't, wish she could talk to him again. The difference is we don't have a video of us being an asshole at his funeral. She does, and she will for the rest of her life.</p><p><span></span><p>

## Elon Musk fires a bunch more people for sassing him in public, then goes on Twitter to laugh about it

Remember <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-fired-employee" target="_blank">yesterday's story about him firing a guy ON Twitter</a>? That guy wasn't the only person wished well in his future endeavors. Musk fired a bunch more people for criticizing him in public. But them he fired via email like a normal person.</p><p>Nick Morgan was fired. He said on Twitter it was for "not showing 100% loyalty in Slack" and that he's "heard the same thing has happened to many others now." Please note: Slack is an app used so employees can communicate with each other when they aren't in the same office at the time. Criticizing your boss on Slack is like criticizing him in the office kitchen.</p><p>I, at least, <em>think</em> Nick was a real employee. It says parody in his name and he doesn't have a blue checkmark. I have no way of knowing for sure.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">ü´° <a href="https://t.co/0HkKC0cA6K">pic.twitter.com/0HkKC0cA6K</a><br />‚Äî Nick Morgan (parody) (@skilldrick) <a href="https://twitter.com/skilldrick/status/1592519449307148289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Elon Musk confirmed the news on Twitter.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I would like to apologize for firing these geniuses.

Everyone remembers former Twitter employee Ligma Johnson who was fired on Elon's first day <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-elon-musk-layoff" target="_blank">and interviewed by the media as he left the building one last time</a>.

The Karma Police will pull you over in an instant, and there is no defunding them. I just have a hard time feeling bad for Big Tech employees.

## Watch: Ron DeSantis responds to Trump insults, says 'go check out the scoreboard' from Tuesday night

Trump is in DeSantis' state to give a big announcement, where he is expected to announce he is running for president again. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-biden-hurricane-ian" target="_blank">DeSantis is also rumored to be considering a run for president</a>.</p><p>The question is if DeSantis has any thoughts on anything that has been said about him lately:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Let's. Go. <a href="https://t.co/pQhAxu0te3">pic.twitter.com/pQhAxu0te3</a><br />‚Äî Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) <a href="https://twitter.com/CurtisHouck/status/1592566547381653504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>"One of the things I'm learned in this job is when you're leading, when you're getting things done, You take incoming fire.

<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="9aa81" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32100004&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Desantis went on to say, "I have corporate media outlets having a spasm just because I'm getting out of bed in the morning. I don't think any governor has gotten attacked more than me during my four-year term. I think what you learn is, all that's just noise. Are you leading, are you getting in front of issues, are you delivering for people, and are you standing up for folks? If you do that, none of [that other] stuff matters. That's what we've done. We've focused on results and leadership."</p><p>This is the line I think will leave a mark. Because a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-donald-trump" target="_blank">number of prominent conservatives</a> have pointed to election night (<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/donald-trump-desantis-rant" target="_blank">and Trump's behavior</a>) as a key reason why the GOP needs a change.</p><p>"At the end of the day, I would just go tell people to check out the scoreboard from last Tuesday night. The fact of the matter is it was the greatest Republican history in the state of Florida. "</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="429af" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32100005&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Here's the thing in all this... DeSantis has to run now. He can't make the Chris Christie 2016 mistake where he doesn't strike while the iron is hot. Then turn into... well, what Chris Christie has turned into.</p><p>If DeSantis DOESN'T decide to run for president in THIS primary, it's going to look like he was mean-girled out it by the time 2028 rolls around, conservatives will have moved on to something else.</p><p>He's obviously not going to be at Trump;s announcement today. This was a clear elbow throw at the former president. Now what?</p><p><p>

## Brilliant: Dave Chappelle performed fake monologue during SNL dress rehearsals so they didn't know what he'd say live

The first, "Dave," means "controversy." The second, "Chappelle," means "I don't give a f*ck, Twitter's not a real place." Controversy over his SNL appearance continues with reports he gave them a fake monologue so they wouldn't know what he'd say live.  </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="5f9b0" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32099875&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Chappelle was announced as an upcoming host for SNL. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-snl-outrage" target="_blank">Random idiots on Twitter</a> were upset because they thought they had canceled Chappelle. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-snl-boycott" target="_blank">SNL writers allegedly boycotted writing comedy</a> for the GOAT comedian on a comedy show. Dave showed up anyway and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-snl" target="_blank">people couldn't decide if his monologue mocked Ye or supported Ye</a>. The Anti-Defamation League <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-adl" target="_blank">issued a statement agreeing with the latter</a>.</p><p>Chappelle representatives issued a statement to the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website on all the controversy of the past few weeks:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="f90f4" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32099873&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>You're now ready for today's news. The reason why Dave Chappelle's "controversial" monologue made air is that the producers never knew what he was going to say. The comedian performed DIFFERENT MATERIAL during the pre-show dress rehearsal.<br /></p><p><a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/11/14/dave-chappelle-switched-snl-monologue-from-rehearsal-to-show/" target="_blank">From the New York Post</a>:</p><blockquote>A source told Page Six: ‚ÄúDave does a fake monologue during the dress rehearsal because he doesn‚Äôt want [‚ÄòSNL‚Äô creator] Lorne Michaels, or anyone else, to know what his real monologue is.‚Äù</blockquote><blockquote>The source added that Chappelle made a joke during the dress rehearsal about a writer who refused to work with him this week on the show.</blockquote><p>Also, "tension flared" about the boycotting writer joke. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="aec64" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32099916&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>It was all for naught. The comedian performed different material when the show went live. Because he's Dave Chappelle and he does Dave Chappelle things.</p><p>That's if this report is true. It could be a story concocted by producers and leaked to The Post so they could be absolved of any criticism of Dave's performance. Either way, it's Dave's world. We either laugh in it or cry about it on Twitter.</p><p><p>

## Science lover Neil deGrasse Tyson offers the DUMBEST take on the midterms, it involves the 'Fauci Ouchie'

Those same friends then switched to an unhealthy fetish for Greta Thunberg and NDT fell off.

</p><p>To be fair to NTD, he's sourcing a peer-reviewed *checks notes* political blog. The blog offered evidence for their hypothesis that 9,400 people in Nevada died of schmovid and the data suggests a majority of them may have been Republican voters. And since dead voters usually go Democrat (dear Meta, we are using the literary device called "snark"), the lack of live voters cost the GOP a senate seat. So it wasn't deGrasse's idiotic statement as much as the idiotic statement of a political blogger. deGrasse only applied the idiotic statement with the full weight of his science behind it.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="09ba3" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32099457&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>No word on if people who got their Fauci Ouchie and died of other things cost Democrats the House. Or if all the New York pro-the science worshipers of Fauci, who did everything they were told to do by their government but died anyway, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lee-zeldin-rnc-chair" target="_blank">cost Democrats a bunch of Congressional seats</a>. </p><p>It's the same basic logic. Take a dumb thing you think will own your opponents + tie it to something unrelated = hot take!</p><p>A smartyman like Neil deGrasse Tyson should know better than to use the "retweets don't equal endorsement" scientific method. Yet here we all are.</p><p><p>

The latest is Elon Musk cutting free lunches and making employees provide their own like every other employee in every other company ever.

While the company was paying a full staff of chefs to cook for the San Francisco office, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-twitter-polls" target="_blank">no one was coming to work in the San Francisco office</a>. People don't want to leave their homes in the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-schoolchildren" target="_blank">progressive utopia of San Francisco</a> for some reason. Go figure.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Especially bizarre given that almost no one came to the office.

I have no reason not to believe Elon isn't 100% accurate.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">False. Twitter spends $13M/year on food service for SF HQ.

To those angry at their new boss's decree, we have two suggestions. The first is to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-fired-employee" target="_blank">not say so on the public timeline</a>. The second should be to find a new source of nourishment. One that is plentiful in the Big Tech industry.</p>

<p>(Apropos of nothing, I should get around to watching Archer for the number of times I use that .gif)</p><p>Twitter employees, whoever's left, need to find a way to balance throttling opposing viewpoints and feeding themselves. Elon doesn't give a turd. I don't know if Twitter will last until the end of the year, but it's fun to watch.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Biden stabs supporters in the back, says they 'can't expect much of anything' on abortion rights

Their plan to fight inflation was abortion. Their plan to combat crime was abortion. Their fix to the border crisis created by Joe Biden was abortion. Abortioning abortionity abortion. Unfortunately, by all accounts, it looks like the plan worked and Democrats were able to late-term abort the red wave.</p><p>Except in New York, where <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lee-zeldin-rnc-chair" target="_blank">the entire state shifted right</a> and we <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/new-york-zeldin-molinaro-langworthy" target="_blank">singlehandedly saved the House for the GOP</a>. You're welcome, America.</p><p>Democrats won. Joe Biden, who promised voters if they held the senate they would codify Roe v Wade and make it legal to abort your choices up until birth in all fifty states, got what he asked for. So, OBVIOUSLY, his first order of business would be to do that.

<p>It's less than a week, and our dude's not even pretending. It's almost admirable if you forget he's a dementia-ridden old coot who barely knows where he is, doesn't know if it's a fart or something else, and has access to the nuclear football.</p><p>But, hey. The voters spoke! And when those same voters complain about the crime in their cities or how they can't afford groceries, I'm going to need to hear who they voted for before deciding if I care. Or if they need to file a complaint with the Department of Deez.</p><p><p>
