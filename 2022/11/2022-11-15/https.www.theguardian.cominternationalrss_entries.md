<p>The striker – poised to represent Uruguay at a 10th tournament – on getting joy from nature, wanting to be a vet and why his country succeeds</p><p>Edinson Cavani is miles away. He has played in five countries, at some of the biggest clubs in the biggest leagues, alongside the biggest stars; he is about to represent Uruguay at his 10th international tournament; and he has racked up 785 games, scored 434 goals and won 26 trophies, but he cannot help being drawn to somewhere else entirely. Back to where it began, far from the training centre where he sits now, a necessary escape. “Name all those places, and I say: ‘No, leave me in Salto,’” he says. “Beneath a tree, in the shade, where the breeze blows, without the sound of cars.”</p><p>Cavani talks about the game as a “passion” inherited from his father, a forward who played against Luis Suárez’s dad in Salto where the two Uruguay strikers were born three weeks apart. He discusses dedication, the competitiveness running through him, and the striker’s art, dissected in detail and distilled in a line: “Football is time and space.” There is a wonder at some of the things he did but still cannot explain and he describes a month at the World Cup as a joy “where you feel <em>totally </em>connected to football, where you <em>live</em> it, every second”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/15/edinson-cavani-maybe-i-dont-fully-fit-with-modern-football-in-terms-of-attitudes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The pioneering German-Jewish artist was murdered by the Nazis but her work lives on. The makers of a new biopic, featuring the voices of Keira Knightley and Helen McCrory, explain her enduring appeal</p><p>In October 1943, shortly before her deportation, the young German-Jewish artist Charlotte Salomon gave Life? or Theatre? – her monumental series of semi-autobiographical artworks – to a friend for safekeeping. Upon arrival at Auschwitz, aged 26, newly married and pregnant, Salomon was murdered, and it would be many years before Life? or Theatre? would be exhibited.</p><p>Subtitled Ein Singspiel, a play with music, the work comprises over 700 multilayered gouaches, many with transparent textual overlays. It<strong> </strong>is considered by some people to be the first graphic novel.<strong> </strong>Painted between 1940 and 42, Life? or Theatre? combines historical events and personal memories<strong>, </strong>referencing film, music and theatre. It tells the story of a traumatic past and a troubled family marked by the suicides of more than one of Salomon’s female relatives, including her mother. There are also hints of sexual abuse, a possible murder committed by her, and accounts of unrequited love. But throughout, there is a conscious blurring of reality and fantasy, with characters presented as fictionalised versions of significant and influential people in Salomon’s life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/15/charlotte-salomon-keira-knightley-helen-mccrory-nazis-auschwitz-life-theatre-murdered">Continue reading...</a>

Looked at one way, then, Jeff’s benevolence would be the equivalent of donating £34.56 to charity. Have YOU ever donated thirty-four quid to charity? Do you pay your taxes? If so, you’re actually being <em>more generous than Jeff Bezos, </em>who, famously, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2021/06/08/richest-americans-including-bezos-musk-and-buffett-paid-federal-income-taxes-equaling-just-34-of-401-billion-in-new-wealth-bombshell-report-shows/">avoids almost all of his</a>.

<p>John Peel loved them; the NME was briefly thrilled. But as a career-spanning Bog-Set is released, our writer recalls how for a select few their awkward sounds were life-changing</p><p>According to Spotify, our musical tastes are hammered into shape around the age of 14. We’re destined to return to that early teenage soundtrack for the rest of our lives, and in my case the theory checks out. When I was 14, a friend’s older brother came back from university for the summer with some records by Bogshed, and I was quickly besotted. The sleeves featured macabre, pencil-drawn images of characters in states of distress, and the music was similarly agitated: rickety guitar riffs, a crunchy bass and a singer who would alternately bark and croon a barrage of non sequiturs. “Die scousers spiele Fußball!” he yelled, for no apparent reason. I couldn’t stop grinning. My friend’s brother could have come home with LL Cool J’s Radio that summer and things might have turned out differently, but he didn’t. Bogshed was where it was, and because I was 14 at the time, Bogshed is where it still is today. No other music makes me feel quite so elated.</p><p>When I mentioned this to former Bogshed bass player and sleeve illustrator Mike Bryson, he gave a world-weary laugh. “Unfortunately, you’re not representative of the world, Rhodri,” he said. When we spoke in October he was receiving care in a hospice near Lancaster following cancer treatment. He died<strong> </strong>last week, one month before his band’s back catalogue is being rereleased on a 5-CD set entitled Bog-Set. “I’m delighted that it’s happening, even though it’s on CD, just as CDs are becoming obsolete,” he said. “I hope I’m still here when it comes out.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/15/bogshed-bog-set">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Whether or not you agree with their tactics, activists blocking roads and stopping traffic are on the right side of history</p><p>“When the anti-suffrage members of the government criticise militancy in women, it is very like beasts of prey reproaching the gentler animals who turn in desperate resistance at the point of death.” These words were spoken by Emmeline Pankhurst some 110 years ago. As the great-granddaughter of Emmeline, and the granddaughter of Sylvia Pankhurst, I’m often asked to make comparisons between the suffragette movement and the environmental movements of today. People regularly ask me whether I endorse the tactics of climate activists such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/11/just-stop-oil-to-halt-protests-on-m25-motorway">Just Stop Oil</a>.</p><p>The climate activists who recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/14/just-stop-oil-activists-throw-soup-at-van-goghs-sunflowers">threw tomato soup</a> on a Vincent van Gogh painting might easily be regarded as gentle beasts turning to desperate resistance. The climate crisis is already deadly for many around the world: in east Africa, one person dies of climate-induced hunger every 36 seconds. My great-grandmother advised suffragettes to go to the House of Commons and refuse to leave; to break windows; to “attack the secret idol of property”. The point she was making was that within every cause there is room for people to find their own versions of activism and militancy. The choice of tactics must not divide the movement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/15/suffragette-grandmothers-heroes-climate-protesters-activists-traffic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We are probably better off not knowing what Luca Guadagnino used to mimic the human organs that Taylor Russell and her co-star munch through</p><p><br />There is a lot to unpack when it comes to Luca Guadagnino’s new film, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/02/bones-and-all-review-luca-guadagnino-timothee-chalamet-venice-film-festival">Bones and All</a>.

(Which he has denied.)</p><p>Which all sounds like quite a bit to process, so let’s concentrate on something tastier.

<p>With Farrell Sr in line for the world coach award and his son set for his 100th cap, a big weekend looms for the formidable pair</p><p>The list of successful British sporting fathers and sons is not as long as you might think. The Redknapps and the Cloughs in football, Damon and Graham Hill in motor racing and Sir Ian and Liam Botham in cricket are perhaps the most widely known. In rugby union the Youngs and Vunipola dynasties have achieved plenty, as has the extended Hastings clan.</p><p>Has there ever been a duo, though, to match Andy and Owen Farrell? Take this weekend’s diary for example: Andy is on the shortlist for the World Coach of the Year award, due to be announced in Monte Carlo on Sunday, while Owen is set to win his 100th England cap against the All Blacks at Twickenham on Saturday.

<p>Popping to see Jagger, collaring Captain Tom on daytime TV or taking their dad’s advice – these artists share how they topped the singles charts </p><p>I was all set to give up music for a scholarship at New York University. Then my father suggested that if I sang Who’s Sorry Now? – a song from 1923 – with rock’n’roll triplets, it would appeal to grown-ups and younger buyers. I hated it. I thought the song sounded “square” and right up to the last minute I didn’t want to record it. I went into the session with every intention of running out of time, but halfway through I asked the rhythm section to provide a stronger beat. I sang louder, and that second half is what most people recall. After I sang it on Dick Clark’s American Bandstand it took off in the States, but in the UK there were only two TV channels so it was entirely down to radio plays. Being No 1 felt overwhelming, but I’m continually amazed by the reception given to what’s been called “the ultimate revenge song” by younger generations. Just recently it’s been used as Disney’s Cruella trailer and in Don’t Worry Darling, starring Harry Styles, which amazes me. <strong>Connie Francis</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/15/brian-may-sugababes-and-more-on-hitting-no-1-singles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The movie star’s televisual debut is full of fun, retro energy and action hero-lite antics, as he plays a veteran mobster trying to take over Oklahoma. Just don’t expect innovation</p><p>Do you know what I hate? I hate it when you spend 25 years in prison keeping shtum for your New York mafia family and on your release they exile you to Oklahoma with some nonsense about it being virgin mob territory and yours for the taking, instead of reinstating you as the capo di capo’s righthand man. On this matter, Dwight Manfredi (Sylvester Stallone – yes, that Sylvester Stallone) and I are as one.</p><p>That, alas, is 75-year-old Dwight’s situation at the beginning of 76-year-old Stallone’s first television venture, Tulsa King (Paramount+). Essentially a pragmatist, he simply punches the new capo unconscious, packs his bag and heads to the Sooner State. There he is startled by grasshoppers, baffled by the youthful slang of his cab driver Tyson (Jay Will), and quickly intrigued by the legal pot dispensary on the outskirts of town. Before they’ve even got to his hotel, he has had Tyson pull over and wait while he nips in and establishes the first node in what I’m sure will soon be a flourishing protection racket. Emerging with his first 20% weekly cash cut from owner Bodhi (Martin Starr), he chucks a wad of notes at Tyson, appoints him his personal driver for $2,000 a week and tells him to buy a Navigator by tomorrow. The hotel receptionist introduces him to the concept of an Uber and apps when he wants to go out that evening. I could ask if we are meant to assume he has been in solitary confinement rather than merely incarcerated for the last quarter of a century, but I remember trying to explain telephone banking to my 70-odd-year-old parents (who have not served any time in prison) and realise that any amount of technical ignorance they want to heap on Dwight is probably only fair.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/15/tulsa-king-review-sylvester-stallone-mobster-paramount">Continue reading...</a>

They are classics and to my mind a pretty much unshakable part of the yuletide table.</p><p>That said, I like to ring the changes too: a crisp salad to sit aside the smoked salmon or to serve with a plate of oysters; roast parsnips with a pomegranate raita; and stuffing studded with cranberries and chestnuts. As well as roast potatoes I will sometimes cook them in slices, with goose fat and rosemary (wonderful to cheer up a plate of cold roast pork).

<p>The arguments given by Arts Council England ignore all the good work we do to bring opera to everyone – it should think again</p><ul><li>Stuart Murphy is chief executive of English National Opera</li></ul><p>Last week was, frankly, grim. Having run English National Opera for the past five years, to be given less than 24 hours’ notice that our 100-year-old company must up sticks from London to Manchester, with a small relocation allowance to help us to do so, was galling. Particularly when it quickly became apparent that no audience analysis had been conducted.</p><p>However, what has been even stranger to witness are some of the baffling narratives originating from Arts Council England (ACE) in response to our shock, as seen in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/14/eno-opera-funding-arts-council-audiences">recent opinion piece in the Guardian.</a> The first of these is that large-scale opera has <a href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/blog/investing-future-music">shown no growth</a> – a point that has never been raised prior to this announcement, either with me or any of my other colleagues across opera. If the data exists, I would love to see it – or perhaps it was collected during the lockdowns of recent years? Additionally, why single out an organisation that has spent the past three years entirely focused on audience growth and future-proofing the audience, with our free tickets for under-21s and heavily discounted tickets for under-35s. Since September, 6000 tickets have been claimed through these schemes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/15/cuts-to-funding-will-decimate-english-national-opera-this-is-a-howling-mistake">Continue reading...</a>

Today he has gone further, telling Times Radio that many officials were “scared” to go into Raab’s office.</p><p>When I worked for him, Dominic Raab was not aware of the impact of his behaviour on the people working for him, and couldn’t be made to see that impact. Colleagues did not complain to me formally. It was kind of their professional pride to cope.</p><p>But many were scared to go into his office. His sort of defence was that he treated everyone in the building in the same way. He was as abrasive and controlling with junior ministers and senior officials, as he was with his private secretaries.</p><p>It was language, it was tone, he would be very curt with people. And he did this in front of a lot of other people. I think people felt demeaned.</p><p>What we have at the moment is not fit for purpose. Action is only taken if there is a formal complaint and there is a feeling in the system that the system is stacked in favour of the minister or senior official. So people hesitate to make a formal complaint because of the effect on themselves.</p><p>This needs to be reworked. There needs to be somebody of seniority and independence and authority that can connect both with the prime minister and with the emerging subjects of such complaints.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/nov/15/iain-duncan-smith-rishi-sunak-china-g20-jeremy-hunt-uk-politics-latest">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Animation geeks will enjoy following the twists and turns in the remarkable career of claymation expert Will Vinton </p><p>This documentary about animation maven Will Vinton, whose medium of preference was clay filmed in stop motion, covers his remarkable career in detail, with expected reverence. Strictly as a documentary it’s conventional and a bit snoozy, but animation geeks will revel in the chance it affords to learn more about Vinton, a mostly genial chap who nevertheless had some sharp corners to his character. While the narrative mostly follows a straight-ahead, chronological path through Vinton’s biography, the story comes with a classic parable about how small companies can end up crashing and burning, especially when they get mixed up with strictly material-minded MBA-holders and aggressively controlling angel investors.</p><p>Then again, it’s clear Vinton also had himself partly to blame for his eventual business travails, although for the most part he ran a pretty profitable studio in Portland, Oregon, at a time when few film companies dared to operate more than 50 miles from downtown Los Angeles. Clearly made in cooperation with Vinton (who died in 2018) and his family, director Marq Evans looks back to his subject’s youthful enthusiasm for countercultural hedonism available around his early base in Berkeley, California, a scene that shaped his aesthetic. His first major work – Closed Mondays, co-directed by Bob Gardiner – was rejected by the first film festival they sent it to, but then eventually went on to win an Oscar for best animated short in 1975.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/15/claydream-review-claymation-genius-behind-california-raisins-tells-own-story">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He says it’s not because of me, so how can we fix this? We’ve tried everything from clean eating to giving up smoking</p><p><strong>My </strong><strong>boyfriend and I have been together for a while.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>At the beginning </strong><strong>of our</strong><strong> relationship, we </strong><strong>had sex </strong><strong>nonstop for days</strong><strong> on end. </strong><strong>Now, though, he can’t stay </strong><strong>erect after the first round of intercourse. </strong><strong>He says it’s not because of me</strong><strong> and that he </strong><strong>hasn’t lost any feelings for me. He also </strong><strong>says that this has never happened before. But</strong><strong> i</strong><strong>t</strong><strong> has been going on for </strong><strong>more than a month now. We have tried </strong><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/11/why-we-fell-for-clean-eating">‘clean eating’</a>, getting the correct amount of sleep</strong><strong> and not smoking</strong><strong>. We have even taken breaks from all types of sex. But nothing is working.</strong></p><p>Your boyfriend is not a machine … although he may suspect that’s how you think of him. The downtime that occurs between penile ejaculation and the ability to become aroused again is known as the refractory period – and it is a normal process of recharging. Very few men can skip this phase, and then only under exceptional circumstances. Women, though, can be aroused fairly soon after orgasm – and that leads some to think it is unnatural for a man to have to wait. It is not. Don’t put pressure on your boyfriend to achieve a short refractory period – you will just make him feel ashamed and possibly make it more difficult for him to become erect. Instead, remind yourself that, erotically speaking, quality, not quantity, is best. Being hell-bent on instant sexual gratification is not a road to ecstasy; nor is focusing on the number of orgasms. Instead of keeping score, take a tip from tantric masters who teach that delaying ejaculation leads to heightened eroticism and even a shortening of the refractory period after an interval of avoidance.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

<p>Victory in the T20 World Cup final is a prime example of how cricket is turning into two distinct games</p><p>A little before 8pm local time in Melbourne on Sunday, Adil Rashid stepped up to bowl the 12th over of Pakistan’s innings. The 11th, bowled by Liam Livingstone, had just been swatted for 16. After a sluggish start, Pakistan were 84 for two and the tide of the game was beginning to turn. It was at this point, in the white heat of a World Cup final, that Rashid bowled a wicket maiden.</p><p>We should probably talk a little more about this. Except it’s not that easy. “The Wicket Maiden Heard Around The World” doesn’t really roll off the tongue. It doesn’t have a score or number attached to it. You can’t capture the brilliance of that over in a statue or a photograph. It ended not with wild celebrations or even a salute to the crowd, but a pat on the back and a medium-size round of applause.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/15/england-white-ball-cricket-side-playing-different-sport">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Wendy Chinchilla Araya makes a tremendous debut as a neglected woman with learning difficulties who is believed to have spiritual powers – and who falls for a handsome local boy</p><p>A luminous lead performance – captured almost entirely in closeup – is at the heart of this mysterious drama of sexuality and divine grace. It’s an outstanding first feature from 34-year-old Costa Rican film-maker Nathalie Álvarez Mesén, and her lead performer Wendy Chinchilla Araya is making her own deeply impressive movie debut, having worked before this in dance and mime.</p><p>Araya plays Clara, a woman of early middle age who lives in a Costa Rican village with her elderly mother Fresia (Flor María Vargas Chavez) and teen niece Maria (Ana Julia Porras Espinoza). Clara has learning difficulties and a spine malformation, but Fresia will not hear of Clara having this corrected surgically despite the hospital assuring her there is no cost involved. This is because Clara, in all her innocent strangeness, has developed a local reputation as a healer – curing local people’s maladies by channelling the Blessed Virgin’s presence – and Fresia believes that any change to her daughter’s appearance would be against God’s wishes, and also, perhaps, believes that making her look “normal” would reduce her daughter’s local prestige. Meanwhile, poor Clara’s only friend is their horse Yuca, and she is allowed out in the fields to spend time with this animal on condition that she stays within an area marked out by a number of purple tied cloths.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/15/clara-sola-review-miraculous-drama-of-burgeoning-sexuality-and-divine-grace">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The environmental activist curates a supergroup of climate experts in a valuable set of essays, which at times risk overwhelming the reader</p><p>Being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg">Greta Thunberg</a> is no picnic. Still not yet 20, she has fame but not wealth and an army of obsessive detractors who cannot seem to decide whether she is a puritanical fanatic, a gullible puppet or an attention-seeking hypocrite and therefore call her all three. What they hate most, I think, is her effectiveness. A teenager from Sweden has succeeded in dramatically escalating the discourse around the climate emergency. Global heating is not a dire possibility but a present reality; reducing it is no longer just a question of looking after the planet but of preserving human civilisation in a recognisable form.</p><p>Thunberg is unusual (but should not be) in speaking and behaving in a manner appropriate to what the science tells us, ripping away the standard sticking plasters of reassurance and consolation to leave only raw urgency. She is often dismissed as a Cassandra but, of course, the whole point of the Cassandra story is that she was right. <em>The Climate Book</em> coincides with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop27">COP27</a>, just as the UN environment agency has acknowledged that there is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/27/climate-crisis-un-pathway-1-5-c">“no credible path”</a> to keeping global heating below 1.5 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels. The current figure is 1.1; at the present rate of carbon emissions, it could go as high as 3.2 by the end of the century. As Thunberg writes: “Hope is something you have to earn.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/15/the-climate-book-created-by-greta-thunberg-review-an-angry-call-for-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Amazon Prime movie, aided by Steven Spielberg, tells the story of a Wall-E-esque rover 15-year mission to Mars</p><p>Opportunity is quite a character. I’m talking about the star of Ryan White’s crowd-pleasing, Oscar-tipped documentary Good Night Oppy: a Nasa-engineered rover sent on a 90-day mission to Mars in 2003 that surprisingly stretched to 15 years.</p><p>Opportunity, or Oppy as some affectionately call her for short, is a melange of wheels, wires, antennas and solar panels that come together with traits familiar to humans. She has a neck that looks retrofitted from a kitchen sink drainpipe. And her head has cameras spread horizontally in binocular formation like eyes. And when the rover – in an early scene from Good Night Oppy – halts before what she assumes to be a Martian obstruction but turns out to be her own shadow, we can’t help but attribute a comical personality to her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/15/good-night-oppy-nasa-mars-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A steady stream of bad economic news has filtered into Britain’s property market, prompting fears that prices could tumble. But how worried should people be? Rupert Jones reports</p><p>Ever since Margaret Thatcher’s ‘right to buy’ revolution in the 1980s, the UK housing market has been an obsession for millions of people. For many, buying a home has been like a lottery win, with properties rising in value year after year, often by far more than the average wage. It has spawned an industry of lifestyle programmes pushing people to get on to the property ladder and revamp their homes.</p><p>Recently, however, things have started to go sour. Prices in October fell by 0.9% month on month, according to the mortgage lender Nationwide, in the market’s first decline in 15 months. One of the reasons was a slowdown in demand for properties as a result of spiralling borrowing costs, with a spate of interest rate rises leading to soaring monthly payments.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/nov/15/uk-housing-market-prices-property-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
