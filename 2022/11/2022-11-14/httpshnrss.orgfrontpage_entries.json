16:43:07+00:00", "description": "<p>I'm in the middle of a job search and wanted to share my impression after discussions like https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33563083.<p>I'm an unemployed mid/senior-level developer in the U.S. with a mediocre but solid portfolio and passable social skills. I've applied for many jobs at normal non-FAANG places, almost all of which were a decent match for my background, and employers don't seem desperate. Lots of no responses or form rejections, several places where I was rejected after either the initial or tech screen. I haven't gotten to the negotiation phase yet anywhere. When I asked, most seemed serious about hiring: they just got a new round of funding, there was a backlog of work, something, but still no hire. Also almost no response from external recruiters, and very little inbound LinkedIn messaging from anyone.<p>I'm not complaining, it's just how the grind is. I'm getting enough traction that I'm sure it's just a numbers game. But the employers are not desperate.<p>If you are a candidate without a golden resume or big network and need a job, then definitely don't get complacent because of HNers telling you that $100k-150k jobs are falling off trees. Put together a decent portfolio and then get those applications numbers up from day one. My personal goal is at least 100 applications before seriously considering pivoting to something else.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33596779\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33596779</a></p>\n<p>Points: 31</p>\n<p># Comments: 10</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://justinblank.com/notebooks/performanceoptimizationscanhaveunexpectedlylargeeffectswhencombinedwithcaches.html", "title": "Optimizations Can Have Unexpectedly Large Effects When Combined with Caches", "date_published": "2022-11-14 16:30:59+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://justinblank.com/notebooks/performanceoptimizationscanhaveunexpectedlylargeeffectswhencombinedwithcaches.html\">https://justinblank.com/notebooks/performanceoptimizationscanhaveunexpectedlylargeeffectswhencombinedwithcaches.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33596546\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33596546</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://blockfi.com/november-11-2022-blockfi-update", "title": "BlockFi crypto exchange pauses withdrawals citing FTX/Alameda", "date_published": "2022-11-14 16:25:04+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://blockfi.com/november-11-2022-blockfi-update\">https://blockfi.com/november-11-2022-blockfi-update</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33596419\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33596419</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/14/amazon-reportedly-plans-to-lay-off-about-10000-employees-starting-this-week.html", "title": "Amazon reportedly plans to lay off about 10k employees starting this week", "date_published": "2022-11-14 16:07:38+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/14/amazon-reportedly-plans-to-lay-off-about-10000-employees-starting-this-week.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/14/amazon-reportedly-plans-to-lay-off-about-10000-employees-starting-this-week.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33596079\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33596079</a></p>\n<p>Points: 33</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33595879", "title": "Ask HN: Is there a cloud music library that doesn't keep deleting my music?", "date_published": "2022-11-14 15:57:11+00:00", "description": "<p>Long store:\nI purchased a bunch of audio CDs and Apple Music (the Mac app) offered to rip it and save it into my iCloud library.

They are using people's stolen identities to open bank accounts in their name, making fraudulent Amazon purchases with that account, and then selling the Amazon goods on ebay before finally laundering the profits through crypto.<p>I think the scammer made an error though, which is that he posted his coinbase account url directly in the invitation email.<p>The scam is structured so that all of the \"students\" send crypto payments directly to the ringleader; seems fairly simple to find the ringleader's account and then find the rest of the ring by tracing who is sending money to that account.<p>Here's the intro video I was sent where you can see the coinbase account (I copied the video and made a youtube backup):<p>https://vimeo.com/user188604890?embedded=true&amp;source=owner_name&amp;owner=188604890<p>https://youtu.be/eZGqHx8NS1o<p>Here's also the original text message I was sent:<p>\u0f3a\u25cd\u2501\u2550\u2501\u2550\u2501\u25d3\u2501\u2550\u2501\u2550\u2501\u25cd\u0f3b<p>The only time you'll be invited.

Tom and Jake here from Unthread (<a href=\"https://unthread.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://unthread.io</a>). We make it easy for businesses to manage customer experience (CX) end-to-end inside of Slack. We automatically create tickets for new conversations, handle assignments & escalations, triage with other teams, etc \u2014 all without leaving Slack.<p>Here\u2019s a quick Loom showing how it works: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/8158371d29c84550863adbd6719bb112\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/8158371d29c84550863adbd6719bb112</a><p>Unthread was born out of a failed B2B SaaS startup that we were running for about 2 years. We found clients preferred sending bug reports and feature requests through Slack instead of email or the Intercom widget embedded in our app. This was great for us - Slack is a tool we were already using every day, it\u2019s quick and easy to respond, and it\u2019s less formal than composing an email. The problem is that chat != ticketing, and we struggled to keep track of what needed responses or follow-ups. We used a combination of \u201cmark unread\u201d, \u201cremind me\u201d, and DMs to try to triage, and things still slipped through the cracks.<p>We started building Unthread to manage our own customers\u2019 requests inside of Slack. After piloting with other companies in our YC batch who were having the same pain point, we decided to pivot to it being our product.<p>Unthread automatically tracks incoming messages to a channel. We use some basic NLP to determine if it\u2019s an issue or a friendly hello. If it\u2019s an issue, we create a ticket, assign an owner, and send a private message to the assignee that they need to respond. We have an \u201cinbox\u201d in Slack where you can see all of the open conversations that are assigned to you, manage the status of each conversation, and close them out when you're done. If you\u2019re also doing email support, you can forward emails into a Slack channel where reps can compose a response to be sent via email.<p>The unique approach Unthread takes is that none of this is visible to the end customer. We use a combination of ephemeral messages (only visible to your team) and DMs to keep things private. Customers don\u2019t want to talk to a chatbot, so we help support reps provide real responses to customers by giving them the tools behind the scenes to organize and collaborate.<p>We also have an escalation system (think PagerDuty for Slack messages) to notify a backup person if there hasn\u2019t been a response in time. You can configure this on a per-customer basis to set shorter SLAs for more valuable accounts, and we\u2019re working on adding rotations of who\u2019s the primary point of contact.<p>Anyone in the HN community can install the Slack app directly by using this special link: unthread.io/?referral=hn.<p>We\u2019re excited to hear how this resonates with folks\u2019 current experience using Slack for CX! I imagine there are some opinionated workflows out there :)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33593456\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33593456</a></p>\n<p>Points: 12</p>\n<p># Comments: 6</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/14/apple-class-action-user-tracking-allegations/", "title": "Apple Hit with Class Action Alleging It Tracks Users Despite Privacy Assurances", "date_published": "2022-11-14 13:13:48+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/14/apple-class-action-user-tracking-allegations/\">https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/14/apple-class-action-user-tracking-allegations/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33593455\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33593455</a></p>\n<p>Points: 88</p>\n<p># Comments: 15</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "http://paulgraham.com/want.html", "title": "What You (Want to)* Want", "date_published": "2022-11-14 13:04:25+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/want.html\">http://paulgraham.com/want.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33593349\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33593349</a></p>\n<p>Points: 29</p>\n<p># Comments: 41</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://twitter.com/hautepop/status/1591477455210283010", "title": "The collapse of FTX and Sam Bankman-Fraud is looking quite spicy for journalism", "date_published": "2022-11-14 12:51:39+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hautepop/status/1591477455210283010\">https://twitter.com/hautepop/status/1591477455210283010</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33593234\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33593234</a></p>\n<p>Points: 19</p>\n<p># Comments: 11</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.poker.org/ftx-collapse-tether-operations-have-links-to-infamous-online-poker-cheating-scandals/", "title": "FTX collapse, Tether operations have linked to online-poker cheating scandals", "date_published": "2022-11-14 12:38:47+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.poker.org/ftx-collapse-tether-operations-have-links-to-infamous-online-poker-cheating-scandals/\">https://www.poker.org/ftx-collapse-tether-operations-have-links-to-infamous-online-poker-cheating-scandals/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33593108\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33593108</a></p>\n<p>Points: 42</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.nxtaltfoods.com/news/articles/plant-based/one-of-the-uks-largest-pig-farms-closes-down-following-animal-welfare-breaches/", "title": "One of the UK\u2019s Largest Pig Farms Closes Down Following Animal Welfare Breaches", "date_published": "2022-11-14 12:26:35+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.nxtaltfoods.com/news/articles/plant-based/one-of-the-uks-largest-pig-farms-closes-down-following-animal-welfare-breaches/\">https://www.nxtaltfoods.com/news/articles/plant-based/one-of-the-uks-largest-pig-farms-closes-down-following-animal-welfare-breaches/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33593027\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33593027</a></p>\n<p>Points: 25</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://github.com/openblocks-dev/openblocks", "title": "Show HN: Open-Source Alternative to Retool", "date_published": "2022-11-14 12:20:36+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/openblocks-dev/openblocks\">https://github.com/openblocks-dev/openblocks</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33592990\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33592990</a></p>\n<p>Points: 26</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33592860", "title": "Ask HN: Where to buy cheap but good quality glasses in Europe?", "date_published": "2022-11-14 12:05:23+00:00", "description": "<p>After reading this (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33525673), I felt scammed for buying my glasses for 400 euros, hence the question.

But this is partly due to not owning a house. Where I live the downpayment would consume most of those savings.<p>Ny wife wouldn\u2019t be able to make high skilled wages unless she invested substantial time into upskilling which she doesn\u2019t have at the moment.<p>How do I shake this feeling?
