<p>As her thrilling story of swindlers preying on an heiress turns 20, the author recalls the sinful inspiration Victorian pornography gave her – and the fans who turned their favourite lines into tattoos<br />• <em>Warning: contains spoilers</em></p><p>Fingersmith<em> </em>was my third novel, after Tipping the Velvet<em> </em>and Affinity. It shares their 19th-century setting, but it was inspired by two particular Victorian worlds. The first was that of working-class life as it emerges from the interviews carried out by journalist Henry Mayhew for his brilliantly evocative book London Labour and the London Poor; the second was that of “sensation” fiction, the blockbuster genre established in the 1860s by novelists such as Wilkie Collins and Mary Elizabeth Braddon, whose tales of gothic melodrama revel in themes of domestic violence, secrets, and lost and shifting identities.</p><p>What appealed to me about these worlds was the room they give to marginalised voices, the way they overturn our stereotypes of Victorian gentility. Mayhew’s interviewees include hawkers, vagrants, orphaned children: figures on the edges of mainstream culture but with a complex culture of their own. The sensation novel teems with “ladies in peril”, vulnerable women and girls who are victims on a grand scale. But it’s also full of female protagonists who are swindlers and schemers in their own right – women who are glorious transgressors of social norms. I decided to bring these two worlds together in a way that would, I hoped, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/03/sarahwaters">pay homage to both</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/14/sarah-waters-fingersmith-lesbian-pornography-diabolical-rip-roaring">Continue reading...</a>

They have not just experienced the fatigue of a 60-game season and will be helped by the intensity and freshness of recent league fixtures, so the pace and standard at the World Cup in Qatar, heat permitting, could be at their highest for some decades. An energetic, buoyant, on-form Lionel Messi, now 35, will be helped more than most, having struggled with tiredness in the last two tournaments. But he’s not the only Ligue 1 player who may benefit from a winter World Cup.</p><p>For France, the timing has aided Monaco midfielder Youssouf Fofana’s late charge into Didier Deschamps’ squad. He has been Ligue 1’s most improved player in 2022. Before Monaco sacked Niko Kovac a year ago, the manager had become frustrated with Fofana’s erratic form and laid-back, class-clown off-field persona, dropping the midfielder. New head coach Philippe Clement, however, has put his faith in Fofana and is helping him become one of France’s best midfielders.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/14/ligue-1-players-great-form-winter-world-cup-qatar-lionel-messi-fofana-david">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘The  costumes, the wigs and the dialogue are deliberately very stylised – people use 50 words when 20 would have done. If anyone went off-script they got their fingers slapped’</p><p>One summer, more than 40 years ago now, my family and I stayed in a house near Hay-on-Wye. I always had a pen in my hand, I was always drawing. Intrigued by how the look of a piece of architecture changed according to where the sun was, I decided to draw the house from different perspectives. I set up perhaps five vantage points in the garden offering different views of the building as the shadows moved and the light changed. And I thought here’s an idea for a film. At the same time I was fascinated by England’s grand country houses – we lived near the <a href="https://fonthill.co.uk/history/">Fonthill Estate</a>, and on previous holidays I had painted the splendid <a href="https://www.holkham.co.uk/">Holkham Hall in Norfolk</a>.

<p>His ambition to ‘use it in different ways’ helped steer PiL’s post-punk to genuinely fresh ground and was a formative influence for both U2 and My Bloody Valentine</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/12/keith-levene-founding-member-of-the-clash-dies-at-65-public-image-ltd">Musician Keith Levene dies at 65</a></li></ul><p>There’s no doubt that Keith Levene was a key figure in British punk. He formed the Clash with guitarist Mick Jones aged 16 and co-wrote What’s My Name?, which subsequently appeared on their debut album. He played in the semi-mythical Flowers of Romance with Sid Vicious and Viv Albertine. He was filmed injecting amphetamine in the toilets of the Roxy for DJ and film-maker Don Letts’s Punk Rock Movie and was the subject of the Slits’ Instant Hit, a song about his increasing heroin problem.</p><p>And yet he was also a very anomalous figure in a world where there were supposed to be strict rules about music, dress and attitude: Levene seemed to have discarded the memo about what you were and weren’t supposed to do. He hadn’t just been a fan of prog titans Yes, he had roadied for them on 1973’s Tales From Topographic Oceans tour, one of the high watermarks of prog grandiloquence, precisely the kind of thing you were supposed to keep to yourself in punk’s scorched-earth climate. He was steadfast in the belief that “you have to do the work if you want to be good at guitar”, a line that ran contrary to punk’s anyone-can-do-it ethos. He was not interested in “putting together three chord songs”, which was very much the point of punk, suggesting instead that what you needed to do was “put together a situation where there would be no musical limits”, citing the Beatles or the Grateful Dead – not artists that punk bands were supposed to aspire to – as examples. He lobbied the band’s manager Bernard Rhodes to include a synthesiser in the lineup, like the ones he’d seen Rick Wakeman playing while working for Yes. He got Joe Strummer to join the band – in part by demonstrating to Strummer how well he could play Led Zeppelin songs – then turned their new frontman’s guitar down at rehearsals and gigs, believing him to an insufficiently competent musician. He railed against the band’s “safe and predictable” approach to music.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/14/keith-levene-wrote-his-own-rules-for-rock-guitar">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A jury relives the grisly night a man dismembered and cooked his parents’ bodies, a horror cleverly packaged as a slick courtroom drama</p><p>This real-life crime drama is inspired by a brutal double murder in Hong Kong in 2013, when a 28-year-old man murdered and dismembered his parents. He cooked parts of their bodies in the microwave; police found the heads in a freezer. The case sparked a media frenzy; what’s interesting about The Sparring Partner is that the horrors of the case have been turned into a serious, cerebral, densely layered film. This is part stylish courtroom drama, relishing the intellectual sparring of the barristers. Behind the scenes we watch tense negotiations in the jury room. It’s also a whodunnit – presenting conflicting versions of the murders in flashback.</p><p>In fact, we know who the main culprit is almost from the start. After making a public appeal for help in finding his missing mum and dad, Henry (Yeung Wai-lun) soon confesses to their murder. He’s chillingly played here as a smirking, loathsome inadequate who longs for his moment of fame. (Though I could have lived without the silly, shallow scenes depicting his Hitler fantasies – dressed up in the uniform with a moustache.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/14/the-sparring-partner-review-a-stylish-take-on-a-gruesome-real-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Latest updates: foreign secretary avoids giving exact numbers on how increasing cooperation with France will affect small boat crossings</p><p><strong>James Cleverly</strong>, the foreign secretary, was criticised last month for saying that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/26/uk-minister-criticised-over-call-for-gay-world-cup-fans-to-show-respect-in-qatar">gay football fans visiting Qatar for the Word Cup should “be respectful”</a>, and make allowance for the country’s intolerance of homosexuality.</p><p>In an interview on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Cleverly defended his comments, saying that the Foreign Office always advises people to obey local laws when they are travelling. He told the programme:</p><p>My focus is to make sure that British visitors, particularly LGBTQ+ visitors to Qatar going to enjoy the World Cup, are safe and that they enjoy their tournament. So my advice was purely about ensuring that they have a safe and secure time at the World Cup.</p><p>We always say that you have to respect the laws of your host nation. That is a universal element of British travel advice.</p><p>I’ve spoken at length with the Qatari authorities on this and it’s worth bearing in mind that men and women don’t typically hold hands in Qatar, and other conservative Muslim countries like Qatar, so my strong advice is to look at the<a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/qatar/local-laws-and-customs"> UK government’s travel advice.</a></p><p>This deal is just the same as previous deals - spending money and resources on intercepting and obstructing people crossing the Channel, while doing nothing to address their need for safe access to an asylum system.</p><p>The inevitable result will be more dangerous journeys and more profits led by ruthless smuggling gangs and other serious criminals exploiting the refusal of the UK and French government to take and share responsibility.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/nov/14/james-cleverly-uk-france-channel-asylum-seekers-rishi-sunak-g20-uk-politics-latest">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As England’s top flight halts for the World Cup we review the campaign and pick a best XI from across all 20 clubs </p><p>We can sit here and overanalyse these matters to find a clever answer but sometimes the simplest is the best. Step forward Erling Haaland. Since arriving in the Premier League the Norwegian<strong> </strong>striker-bot’s record of 18 goals in 13 appearances – that’s one every 58 minutes he’s on the pitch – is frankly absurd. His movement and finishing are like nothing football has seen, leaving defenders rightly confused regarding how to stop him. Those at the World Cup will be pleased they will not have to face him because Norway did not qualify. On the other hand, it will mean he is rested for the second half of the season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/14/premier-league-season-so-far-best-signing-biggest-disappointment">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dirk and Rhiannon, both 53, got chatting on a goth music forum in 2010. They married in 2014, and now live together near Frankfurt in Germany</p><p>In the early 00s, Rhiannon was a big fan of dark wave goth music. In 2010, she joined an online forum to follow German band Deine Lakaien. “I was living in London and working in a university,” she says. “I had studied languages in the past and thought joining the group would be a good way to improve my German, as well as learn more about the band.”</p><p>Through the forum Rhiannon, who is from Shropshire, soon met Dirk. He lived in Rödermark, near Frankfurt, and worked in logistics. “My hobby was writing about bands and taking pictures of them for different blogs and forums,” he says. “My friend had told me about this band because the singer had such a special voice. I wasn’t that into dark wave music, but this particular singer was really good.” Dirk and Rhiannon began to chat online, in German, and learned more about each other. At Christmas, Dirk gave Rhiannon a traditional festive Christstollen cake. “I’d asked her if she had ever tasted one and she said no, so I decided to send her one,” he says. “The way she wrote to me was very open and kind.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/14/how-we-met-rhiannon-dirk-goth-music-germany">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Made with minimal resources and modest ambition, their lo-fi recordings are an enduring indie inspiration. The band looks back to a time when record deals seemed a far-fetched prospect</p><p>One night in December 1983, Calvin Johnson, Bret Lunsford and Heather Lewis of Beat Happening were asked to play a last-minute set at a house party. They had started the band just a few months earlier and were yet to own a drum kit; after hearing one of their songs, the previous band refused to loan them theirs. Instead, the trio settled on a garbage can from the street. “It was no big deal,” Johnson recalls nonchalantly. The band were accustomed to improvising: throughout their career, they famously used empty yoghurt pots, cardboard boxes and a string of borrowed kits in lieu of their own, while crafting askew melodies from thrift shop-bought guitars and masking inexperience with an Echoplex.</p><p>This initiative and open-minded approach to music was core to Beat Happening, who favoured rudimentary song structures, matter-of-fact lyrics and unadulterated emotion. They formed in Olympia, Washington, an unassuming city in the Pacific north-west that was home to an exciting independent music scene. Johnson and Lewis attended Evergreen State College, a local liberal arts institution that encouraged extracurricular activities and creative pursuits; the campus radio station, Kaos, where Johnson had worked from the age of 15, adopted a policy that 80% of music broadcast must be from independent labels. Johnson’s own label K Records, which would go on to release all of Beat Happening’s albums, followed suit, adopting the mission statement: “K explodes the teenage underground into passionate revolt against the corporate ogre world-wide.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/14/beat-happening-it-was-about-having-this-adventure-with-your-friends">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As viral stories about the hermitic country abound, North Koreans face devastating hunger and Covid clampdowns</p><p>Until January 2020, the joint security area of the Korean Demilitarised Zone (DZ) was the one place on the peninsula where forces from North and South Korea stood face to face – a spot where Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCU9JIEIBKw">met and shook hands</a>. The US and South Korean troops stationed there have a lonelier watch now. On the North’s side, weeds poke out from the gravel and sprout between the steps of its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/26/world/asia/dmz-kim-moon-meeting.html">Panmungak Hall</a>, set just behind the demarcation line. Occasionally, soldiers venture out on to the terrace that runs along its first floor – but only clad in full hazmat suits. On an autumnal morning, the sole sign of life is a distant face peering through binoculars from the second floor. This wearer is in full protective gear too, though stationed safely behind glass. Since the emergence of Covid-19, the few windows into the country have slammed shut.</p><p>The victims are the North Korean people, now more isolated than ever. It’s also bad news for the rest of us, our ability to understand a totalitarian country with an ever-expanding nuclear programme even further reduced. Pyongyang’s recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/13/north-korea-fired-another-ballistic-missile-seoul">flurry of missile tests</a>, and the likelihood of a seventh nuclear test, have rightly commanded headlines. There is also, less happily, an insatiable appetite for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPticIwnTbw">tales of the country’s absurdities</a> or lurid excesses, real or imagined. We’ve been told that Kim Jong-un had his ex-girlfriend killed by firing squad (she later <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/kim-jongun-s-executed-exgirlfriend-miraculously-reappears-on-north-korean-state-television-9390320.html">appeared</a> on television), that his uncle was not just executed but fed to dogs (a claim that originated as <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jang-song-thaek-eaten-by-dog_n_4547814">satire</a>), and that state media insisted until recently that his grandfather had <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/fake-news-north-korea-fact-checking-752006">mastered teleportation</a>. These stories feed on the west’s gullibility and desire for sensation and the regime’s well-documented cruelty, bombastic propaganda and genuine oddity – but also on Pyongyang’s obsessive secrecy: when so little can be seen, anything seems possible.</p><p>Tania Branigan is a Guardian leader writer; she spent seven years as the Guardian’s China correspondent<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/14/west-north-korea-stories-hunger-covid">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A classic recipe book inspires this autumnal vegetable soup/stew that’s another ‘fast, good and infallible’ seasonal meal when made in a pressure cooker</p><p><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Spagnol">Elena Spagnol</a> published more than 20 cookbooks, among them: Presto e Bene (Quickly and Well); Allora, Si Mangia (And So, We Eat);<em> </em>La Gioia in Cucina (Joy in the Kitchen); Cucina Intantanea (Instant Cooking); Il Forno a Microfonde (From Oven to Microwave); and the beautifully titled L’Apriscatole della Felicità<em> </em>(The Can Opener of Happiness). </p><p>Spagnol was a highly respected translator, working on texts by Bertrand Russell and PG Wodehouse, when her first cookbook was published in 1967. The book was called Il Contaminuti<em> </em><em>(</em>The Timer), a cookery book for women who work. Its aim, as with all her books, was to simplify cooking, eliminate unnecessary ingredients and find rapid and economical methods. It was a book born of her own experience as someone who loved and needed to cook, and loved and needed to work, too. Also, as someone who worked with words. As a translator, you are required to evaluate, acutely, each word the author chooses. Spagnol applied the same principle both to cooking and writing about it. No wonder she loved writing about the pressure cooker. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/nov/14/autumn-minestrone-recipe-pumpkin-potato-beans-greens-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

But, befitting his <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/cameron-douglas-michael-douglas-prison-drugs-long-way-home-1203388250/">newly sober and reformed status</a>, Douglas takes the paternal cop role in The Runner, while French-Finnish actor Edouard Philipponnat (soon to be seen in Ridley Scott’s Napoleon) is a teenage drug-dealing screwup; both give robust performances in this deeply felt but somewhat cumbersome thriller.</p><p>It plays a bit like Hamlet, if Hamlet was constantly bumping coke and hawking every substance going around. Gilded high-schooler Aiden (Philipponnat) is busted by the no-nonsense Detective Wall (Douglas), who releases him on the proviso he helps take down a local big-shot dealer. Aiden steers his partner Blake (Nadji Jeter) into inviting the kingpin (Eric Balfour) to the epic party he’s throwing at his mother’s high-spec townhouse, where he has to wear a wire. But Aiden starts to disintegrate under the stress, compulsively reminiscing back to his own Ophelia, doomed first love Layla (Kerri Medders).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/14/the-runner-review-cameron-douglas-edouard-philipponnat">Continue reading...</a>

I usually spend between 10 and 20 minutes on it while the kettle boils or I load CBeebies or write some emails. It used to be eBay. Then Wordle. Now it’s this.</p><p>Duolingo is a language learning app and pretty simple to use. After you’ve chosen which language you want to learn, you are presented with about 100 skill-sets divided by scenario or grammar (grocery shopping, the future tense and so on). Each level is structured like branches of a tree, and when you complete one, you move down the tree earning gems to “spend” on the app or hearts that you need to perform the exercises. Make a mistake, and you must correct it before moving on. It’s all fun and games until you make too many mistakes, run out of hearts and lose your progress. This is when you’ll engage with Duolingo’s mascot, an officious green owl called Duo who, if you’re anything like me, will eventually define your self-esteem.

<p>As a former local broadcaster, I’ve seen how vital radio is to our communities. It should be the jewel in the BBC’s crown</p><p>I came into work at <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_three_counties_radio">BBC Three Counties Radio</a> one day to a message from the daughter of one of my regular listeners. I had struck up an unlikely off-air friendship with her mother, the warm, opinionated and razor-sharp Beryl, after we’d first met at an outside broadcast. Her daughter explained that she had fallen ill a few days previously and had sadly died, but not before writing a note to her family with strict instructions to inform me in the event of her death.</p><p>As the dust following announcement of more swingeing <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/media/bbc-local-radio-cuts-staff-not-going-down-without-fight-1953713">cuts to local radio</a> has settled, I think it’s important to remember listeners like Beryl – and the unique connection they have with their BBC local radio station. I left the organisation in 2021 and all my former colleagues have stories like mine to tell: from the late-night show that enabled one listener, who had been adopted, to meet her 100-year-old birth mother for the first time; to the BBC Newcastle show that was contacted by the daughter of a seriously ill local man, asking them to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0b7ldf6">help record a song</a> he’d written for her 56 years previously when she was nine months old. With the help of local music students, the station turned her wish into reality.

Premier League season on pause while the lower leagues keep chugging away. Knackered and injured players off to a country where it’s illegal to be gay, where women who are victims of sexual assault can be put in prison and where thousands of migrant workers have died since Qatar was awarded the tournament 12 years ago. Welcome to the World Cup.</p><p>Of course, we all know these things by now. In fact the impact of hearing about them again and again seems to numb you from the brutal facts.

The Edinburgh fringe sensation talks about trauma, taboos and the importance of being disgusting</p><p>Was there ever a cat so clever? Move over Mr Mistoffelees, because Frankie Thompson has magicked up one of this year’s smartest stage shows with Catts, an unsettling and often wildly funny hour of clowning. It’s a feline fever dream that starts as a riff on Andrew Lloyd Webber’s whiskery musical and finds Thompson mashing up viral cat videos, clips of Postman Pat’s puss Jess and The Simpsons’ Crazy Cat Lady, and lip-syncing along to Elaine Paige and a prepubescent Jacob Rees-Mogg.</p><p>In a Puma T-shirt, her hair in buns like tufty ears, she prowls around the audience, pounds a catwalk-treadmill and relieves herself in a litter tray. Thompson’s feat is to do all this while conveying an unflinching sense of the overwhelming pressures and malaise that send so many of us seeking respite in funny cat videos. It’s a show that sounds raucous but is emotionally raw, drawing on her experience of mental illness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/nov/14/frankie-thompson-catts">Continue reading...</a>

They’ll both face a little more than their fair share of antisemitism, but that’s just the penumbra cast by the good ol’ days, a fondly remembered era recreated as a portal to a more innocent era.

## Paul Newman: The Extraordinary Life of an Ordinary Man review – a screen idol full of self-loathing

<p>A painfully revealing memoir, taken from transcripts of reminiscences Newman recorded in the 1980s, lays bare a candid, complicated star</p><p>Movie stars, bemused by their own magnified faces, don’t usually have much interest in self-analysis. Paul Newman turns out to be the ruthlessly candid exception. In the late 1980s, between beery binges, Newman recorded endless hours of reminiscences, trying finally to understand the insecure, inadequate stranger who skulked behind his handsome facade. Probably alarmed by what he’d revealed, he later destroyed the tapes. But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/27/paulnewman.usa1">after his death in 2008</a>, 14,000 pages of transcripts were discovered in his musty Connecticut basement and in a storage locker; these have now been cut and pasted into an autobiography, supplemented by contributions from colleagues and family members. The result is startling: Narcissus breaks the mirror, leaving only some cruelly jagged shards.</p><p>In the early 1950s, Newman seemed the most unthreatening of Hollywood’s angry young men – less eruptive than Marlon Brando, less twitchy than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/17/screen-legend-montgomery-clift">Montgomery Clift</a>, less surly than James Dean. Tempering the fury unleashed by the others, he played a redeemed hoodlum in <em>Somebody Up There Likes Me</em> and an introverted outlaw in <em>The Left Handed Gun</em>. Eventually, as a wise-cracking robber in <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/23/butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid-paul-newman-robert-reford">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</a></em> and a playful gambler in <em>The Sting</em>, he settled down to be wry and irresistibly charming. But his book hardly mentions roles like these; instead, he ridicules “this goddamn movie star with blue eyes cast as a half-Apache in <em>Hombre</em>”. Overcome by a sense of unworthiness that festers into self-contempt, he calls himself “that decorative little shit”, a merely ornamental creature with an empty centre.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/14/paul-newman-the-extraordinary-life-of-an-ordinary-man-review-a-screen-idol-full-of-self-loathing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Director Rodrigo Reyes re-enacts his experiences with a young Mexican serving life without parole, weighing up the pressures and life choices</p><p>With this startling and sombre documentary, Mexican film-maker Rodrigo Reyes has conducted an experiment in verbatim cinema, or what you might call witness cinema. In 2014, Reyes was at his day job as a California court interpreter translating for a defendant: Sansón Noe Andrade, a young Mexican immigrant who was to be convicted for first-degree murder having been the driver for a drive-by gang shooting, conducted by his 15-year-old brother-in-law. Andrade got life without parole, having denied guilt and denied gang membership; he insisted he was reluctantly giving his brother-in-law a lift out of politeness with no idea of his intention. Andrade had turned down a plea bargain, but then made a bad impression on the jury by claiming not to have heard any gunshots.</p><p>Later, Reyes entered into a correspondence with Andrade, who was to tell him he refused any deal because he was scared of gang reprisals (although his brother-in-law took a deal) and still insists he was not a gang member, though had to join up once in prison for his own safety. So Reyes made it his mission to create a film based on Andrade’s unhappy life, using an actor, Gerardo Reyes, to play Andrade’s adult self and reconstruct their jail-visit conversations on the stage of a cinema in front of a blank screen. More audaciously still, Reyes got Andrade’s sister and brother-in-law to play his parents in reconstructions of his troubled childhood in the Mexican town of Tecomán, with his nephew Antonio, or Toñito, playing his pre-teen self.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/14/sanson-and-me-review-sobering-account-of-teenager-sentenced-to-life-for">Continue reading...</a>
