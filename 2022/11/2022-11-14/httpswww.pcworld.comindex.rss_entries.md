<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>MediaTek executives reiterated their plans to eventually enter the PC market with an Arm processor, challenging Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon in the Windows on Arm market. Unfortunately, the details of its plans are still skimpy.</p>



<p>At an executive summit hosted by the company, MediaTek executives said that they see a $40 billion opportunity for the PC market, which the company will address with a version of its Kompanio mobile processor. MediaTek, which claims to be the fourth-largest fabless company in the world, also plans to build in 5G radios for connectivity, Bluetooth, WiFi, and display ICs for the notebook.</p>



<p>Corporate vice president Vince Hu said that MediaTek planned to move from the &ldquo;low-power space to the high-power space,&rdquo; taking some of the Arm technology it has applied to smartphone chips like its Dimensity processor line and applying it to PCs. He referred to a &ldquo;recognition that we have to support higher-performance applications.&rdquo; </p>



<p>&ldquo;In CPU and GPU we are having to make some bigger investments as a foundational capability,&rdquo; Hu added.</p>



<p>That seems to imply that MediaTek will design any improved CPUs and GPUs in house, rather than acquire or work with external third parties. That would be a different approach than Qualcomm, which has marketed several generations of Arm chips for laptops, but whose performance has struggled to keep up with X86 chips from AMD and Arm. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393932/qualcomm-buys-cpu-startup-nuvia-to-beef-up-pc-smartphone-performance.html">Qualcomm acquired Nuvia</a> as a source of Arm design talent to improve its capabilities, but is currently <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1063248/arm-qualcomm-suit-stresses-windows-on-arms-future.html">involved in a lawsuit with Arm</a>, which has argued that Qualcomm&rsquo;s existing licensing terms to do not include the Nuvia designs.</p>



<p>MediaTek&rsquo;s plans to attack the PC market stem from its current position on Chromebooks &mdash; which, according to company executives, include a position as the top Arm chip supplier to that Chromebook market. MediaTek on Thursday launched the new Kompanio 520 and 528, entry-level chipsets for Chromebooks.</p>



<p>MediaTek&rsquo;s attack on the PC will be led by Adam King, the vice president and general manager of client computing for MediaTek. King spent six years planning Intel&rsquo;s client platforms, and four more as director of notebook product marketing overseeing the 4th-gen through 6th-gen mobile Core chips. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, King stayed mum as well. &ldquo;We absolutely believe in the long term potential of Windows on ARM,&rdquo; King said. &ldquo;We think that the market will over the long term transition to ARM based processors. Because of the power and area efficiency that I described. It&rsquo;s not inevitable &mdash; it requires lots of work and lots of barriers to be overcome. But the benefit is clearly there. I can say that we&rsquo;re working on plans today. I just can&rsquo;t share them with you yet.&rdquo;</p>



<p>MediaTek executives first tipped their plans to enter the PC market last year, though without any details. The company had previously said that it would <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/412226/mediatek-will-sit-out-the-arm-race-for-windows-pcs.html">skip the Windows 10 generation of the PC</a> market, describing it as a limited opportunity. </p>

<p>The Acer Aspire 5 is a good option for most kids, as it ticks a lot of boxes. It&rsquo;s robust, inexpensive, and performance is fast enough for everyday tasks like writing assignments and browsing the web. The keyboard has a spacious layout as well, which is perfect for longer typing sessions. While that&rsquo;s all well and good, the internal components are really what makes this laptop a good buy. Let&rsquo;s crack open the hood, yeah?</p>

<p>This laptop is packing an Intel Core i5-1135G7 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of PCIe SSD storage. The processor has four cores and eight threads. A CPU with multiple cores generally means more reliable performance. Granted, the design is a little boring. But this laptop clearly favors function over attractive aesthetics. The touchpad takes getting used to, as well. All in all, we feel as though the pros far outweigh the cons. The Aspire is worth every penny.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a huge screen at an affordable price point, the Acer Swift 3 is well worth considering. According to our reviewer, the 16-inch 1080p display offers &ldquo;rich, lifelike color.&rdquo; Will your kid care about the vibrant picture? Maybe. Maybe not. Regardless, a big screen is useful for productivity tasks like writing papers and scrolling through documents. While the screen is the main headliner, the specs are surprisingly impressive for the price. </p>

<p>The Swift features an Intel Core i7-11370H processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of PCIe SSD storage. This is a good value for a sub-$800 Windows laptop. The keyboard is also enjoyable to use and the chassis feels durable. Despite the large screen, the Swift is rather slim, making it a good laptop for travel. That said, battery life is mediocre and there&rsquo;s lots of bloatware. If you can live with those flaws, then this is a lovely laptop with solid specs.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for phenomenal battery life, the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is a fantastic option. When we ran our battery benchmark, which cycles through videos and various tasks, the laptop lasted 14 hours on a single charge. In other words, your child doesn&rsquo;t need to worry about plugging in during the school day. The Spin is also a convertible, which makes it really versatile. You can prop it up like a painter&rsquo;s easel for watching videos or swing the screen around and use it like a tablet. The build is rather robust as well. There was hardly any flex in the keyboard tray. </p>

<p>Thanks to the internal components, the Spin delivers relatively zippy performance. It&rsquo;s rocking an Intel Core i5-1135G7 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of PCIe SSD storage. The port selection isn&rsquo;t too shabby, either. You&rsquo;re getting USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, HDMI, a microSD card slot, and a headphone jack. There are a few trade-offs to be aware of, though. Fan noise can be loud under heavier loads and there&rsquo;s no physical privacy shutter on the webcam. However, those issues are relatively minor. Overall, the Spin is a decent laptop that performs well and offers outstanding battery life.</p>

<p>The Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 has a lot to offer, but its standout feature is its keyboard. Our tester liked the &ldquo;crisp and taught&rdquo; feel of the keys. There&rsquo;s even a decent amount of space around the palm rests, which makes for a more comfortable typing experience. The port selection is a solid combination of old and new. It has two USB-C ports, a single USB-A port, a 3.5mm combo jack, and a microSD card reader. There&rsquo;s zero need for an adapter, which is always a plus.</p>

<p>Performance is somewhat mediocre, though. The Flex 5 comes equipped with an Intel Pentium Gold 7505 processor, 4GB of DDR4 RAM, and 32GB of eMMC&nbsp;storage. While the processor is fine, the RAM and storage are on the lighter side. Our tester noticed a slowdown in performance when he opened up multiple tabs. However, as long as you&rsquo;re using the cloud and aren&rsquo;t running anything too intensive or demanding, the Flex 5 is a decent choice. </p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>



<p>The PCWorld team puts each and every Windows laptop through a series of benchmarks that test GPU and CPU performance, battery life, and so on. The idea is to push the laptop beyond its limits and then compare it against others we&rsquo;ve tested. Chromebooks, on the other hand, go through a series of web-based tests. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair or possible to run the same kinds of tests on a Chromebook because they&rsquo;re Chrome OS-based machines. Below, you&rsquo;ll find a breakdown of each test and the reasons why we run them.</p>



<h3 id="windows-laptops">Windows laptops</h3>



<ul><li><strong>PCMark 10</strong>: The PCMark 10 benchmark is how we determine how well the laptop handles general use tasks like web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, streaming, and so on. It&rsquo;s a way to simulate everyday use.</li><li><strong>HandBrake</strong>: HandBrake is more intensive than PCMark 10. It measures how long a laptop&rsquo;s CPU takes to encode a beefy 30GB file. </li><li><strong>Cinebench</strong>: Cinebench is a brief stress test of the CPU cores. It renders a 2D scene over a short period of time. </li><li><strong>3DMark</strong>: 3DMark checks if 3D performance remains consistent over time by running graphic-intensive clips. This is how we test our array of gaming laptops. </li><li><strong>Video rundown test</strong>: To gauge battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 10&rsquo;s Movies &amp; TV app until the laptop dies. If you&rsquo;re a regular traveler, you&rsquo;ll want a battery that can last longer than a full school day.</li></ul><h3 id="chromebooks">Chromebooks</h3>



<ul><li><strong>CrXPRT 2</strong>: The CrXPRT 2 benchmark tests a Chromebook&rsquo;s battery life.</li><li><strong>Speedometer 2.0</strong>: This test determines a Chromebook&rsquo;s web browser performance. It simulates this by adding, completing, and removing a to-do list.</li><li><strong>Basemark Web 3.0</strong>: This benchmark gauges how well a Chromebook can handle web-based applications.</li><li><strong>Kraken 1.1</strong>: Kraken 1.1 is a JavaScript performance benchmark.</li><li><strong>Jetstream 2</strong>: Jetstream 2 is a combination of WebAssembly and JavaScript benchmarks. This is how we gauge how well a Chromebook runs advanced workloads.</li></ul><div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-block faq-block"><h2 class="faq-block-title" id="faq"> FAQ </h2><hr class="block-horizotal-divider" /><div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block"><div class="faq-save-content"><span class="faq-rank">1.</span>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Finding the right laptop for your kid can be a daunting task. If your child is younger or tends to be more accident-prone, do you go for something cheap? What about security concerns? If you&rsquo;re not sure where to start, don&rsquo;t sweat it. We&rsquo;ve put together a couple of quick tips for worried parents. Check out the info below.</p>



<p>If you plan on getting a Windows laptop for school, all you really need are the basics. An Intel Core i3 processor is fine for general-use tasks like surfing the web, writing papers, making presentations, and so on. A <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/619258/what-the-heck-is-a-discrete-graphics-card-anyway.html">discrete graphics card</a> isn&rsquo;t totally necessary unless your kid likes to play <em>Minecraft</em> or some such. If you&rsquo;ve got a budding gamer on your hands, we recommend an Nvidia RTX 3060 or 3050 Ti, as they&rsquo;re relatively affordable. </p>



<p>For RAM, 8GB will keep things nice and zippy. As for storage options, 256GB is a good minimum, especially if your child doesn&rsquo;t have a ton of stored photos. Go for an SSD (solid state drive) if you can, as they&rsquo;re faster and quieter than hard drives.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for a Chromebook, shoot for a mid-range one if you can. Within the $400 to $600 range you&rsquo;re likely to find Intel Pentium processors, which deliver better browser performance and are capable of running more intensive gaming apps. We&rsquo;d suggest at least 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. You don&rsquo;t need a ton of storage space, as you&rsquo;ll be storing most of your work in the cloud.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>If you&rsquo;re buying a laptop for school, battery life is absolutely vital, as your kid is going to be taking this thing from class to class. A laptop that lasts anywhere from 10 to 12 hours on a single charge is a good baseline. That&rsquo;s a good deal more than a full school day. Chromebooks in particular are known for having fantastic battery life, as they&rsquo;re low-powered machines.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402141/chromebooks-versus-windows-laptops-which-should-you-buy.html">A Chromebook is a great fit for most kids</a>, especially if you have any security concerns. They&rsquo;re durable, affordable, and largely virus-free. The downside is that they exclusively run Chrome OS. If you have an older child, a Windows laptop might be a better option. Windows can run just about any app or browser. However, that kind of flexibility comes at a price. Windows laptops tend to be more expensive than Chromebooks (but not always!).</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>The line between laptop and tablet blurs more and more as companies integrate the features of both into their devices. As of now there are still a few key distinctions between the two. Laptops are larger, have more storage, and generally pack better performance and productivity features. Tablets on the other hand are smaller and more portable, tend to have longer battery life, and are typically cheaper.</p>



<p>You should first ask yourself what the primary use of the device will be when choosing between a budget laptop and a tablet. Is productivity and storage the most important to you? Then a laptop&mdash;even a budget model&mdash;will be your best bet. Or do you need something that is portable and has a long battery life? Then a tablet is the way to go.</p>

## Nvidia is still investigating those melting RTX 4090 power cables

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>What&rsquo;s the last thing you want to hear after dropping $1,500+ on a brand new, ultra-powerful graphics card? Probably &ldquo;they just announced a new one,&rdquo; but a close second has got to be &ldquo;it might melt inside your computer.&rdquo; So it&rsquo;s understandable that Nvidia has been scrambling to get to the bottom of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1372988/heres-what-we-know-about-the-geforce-rtx-4090-12vhpwr-cables-melting.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">isolated reports that the RTX 4090 is frying adapter cables</a> for its fancy new 12VHPWR adapters. The good news: Nvidia is still on the case. The bad news: it doesn&rsquo;t have a solution just yet. </p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/kitgurupress/status/1591116997613748224?s=20&amp;t=6LcQhXlOptJ0Bh6HurrNrg&amp;xcust=2-1-1379279-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">KitGuru quoted an Nvidia representative</a>, who said that while the company is continuing its investigation, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have further details to share yet.&rdquo; Nvidia assured its customers that both it and its manufacturing partners are offering RMA returns under the usual graphics card warranties. </p>



<p>While Nvidia investigates, the more tech-savvy members of the PC gaming community have been looking into the matter themselves. It seems fairly settled that the issue is the 12VHPWR adapter cables included in most versions of the RTX 4090, which splits the new compact 16-pin cable into up to four conventional 8-pin power supply rails for those who don&rsquo;t have a new ATX 3.0 PSU. Beyond that, there are several potential culprits. </p>



<p>Some are blaming poorly-designed plastic connectors might be causing electrical pins to not fully insert, especially when the cable is bent just behind the connector. Others are theorizing that the cables might be under-specced, designed for 150 volts instead of 300 volts, or that soldering errors might be allowing shorts in the connection. But there is at least one positive indication: Despite extensive testing, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIKjZ1djp8c&amp;xcust=2-1-1379279-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamersNexus</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.igorslab.de/en/adapter-of-the-gray-analyzed-nvidias-brand-hot-12vhpwr-adapter-with-built-in-breakpoint/&amp;xcust=2-1-1379279-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Igor&rsquo;s Labs</a> have been unable to replicate the melted cables seen by a handful of new RTX 4090 owners. That indicates that the problem, while distressing, is quite rare. We&rsquo;ll have to see if the $1,200 GeForce RTX 4080 suffers from similar issues when it launches on November 16. </p>

## Windows 11’s 2022 Update can hurt game performance, Microsoft warns

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Have your PC games been feeling a bit sluggish since you installed the 2022 update (a.k.a. 22H2) for Windows 11? You&rsquo;re not alone. Microsoft itself has confirmed the observations of many users, saying that the latest version of the operating system can cause systems to &ldquo;experience lower than expected performance or stuttering.&rdquo; According to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-22h2#2950msgdesc&amp;xcust=2-1-1379190-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft&rsquo;s official bug-tracking system</a>, at least some games and other apps are accidentally triggering GPU debugging systems that aren&rsquo;t meant for consumers. </p>



<p>The update was spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/pc-game-performance-can-drop-with-windows-11-22h2-microsoft-warns&amp;xcust=2-1-1379190-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC Mag</a>, and at the moment it&rsquo;s only affecting that very specific and recent build of Windows 11. Unfortunately it doesn&rsquo;t look like there&rsquo;s a practical solution at the moment: Microsoft recommends updating your game to the latest version and/or contacting the developer, which is support speak for &ldquo;we&rsquo;re out of ideas.&rdquo; Naturally, the company says that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;working on a resolution&rdquo; in a future update. </p>



<p>22H2 is the biggest update to Windows 11 this year, and it&rsquo;s been generally well-regarded after a rocky launch to the new OS itself. It&rsquo;s not as if this kind of bug is unknown for a major update. But gamers in particular have been hesitant to upgrade, and it shows. As of August, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/3671335/for-most-users-windows-11-22h2-doesnt-move-the-needle.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1379190-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the majority of Windows users are sticking to Windows 10</a>, despite Windows 11 being offered as a free upgrade and most of the current hardware on the market being compatible. The latest statistical data shows Windows 11 at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide&amp;xcust=2-1-1379190-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">just over 15 percent of desktop users worldwide</a>, second place behind Windows 10 at 71 percent.</p>

<p>Though Windows provides its own file backup facilities in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/833338/windows-file-history-review.html">Windows File Backup</a>, the OS has continually made them less obvious and less intuitive to use. Why, is anyone&rsquo;s guess. There are plenty of alternatives, but they can be hard to find and/or just as difficult to use. Enter Perfect Backup. </p>



<p>It&rsquo;s free and, while just shy of &ldquo;perfect,&rdquo; Perfect Backup does grab the brass ring for being the most straightforward and user-friendly interface. Add to that stable performance and a cornucopia of options, as well as network, FTP, and online services support, and you&rsquo;ve got a winner.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: This review is part of our ongoing roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407021/best-windows-backup-software.html">best backup software for Windows</a>. Go there to learn more about competing products, what to look for in backup software, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="perfect-backup-features">Perfect Backup: Features</h2>



<p>Perfect Backup is file backup&mdash;i.e., it doesn&rsquo;t image entire partitions like our favorite <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/605046/r-drive-image-7-review-the-best-backup-now-looks-the-part.html">R-Drive Image</a> does. Instead it merely copies files and folder to a new location. Truth be known, with Windows so easy to install and restore these days, that&rsquo;s all most users need.</p>



<p>But there are options. A host of them, as a matter of fact. You can specify the number of versions to keep, the number of incremental backups that will transpire before a new full backup is created, and even compress the files to standard Zip format. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1374194" height="809" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Perfect-Backup-8.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Perfect  Backup starts with a wizard that will walk you through the process of creating a backup job. Or restoring.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>There&rsquo;s also very granular scheduling, logging of results, reporting via email, throttling (CPU usage), and just about everything else you&rsquo;d expect from a modern backup program. </p>



<p>My favorite feature, however, is the ability to back up to popular online services: Google Drive, One Drive, Dropbox, and Box to be specific. Now if the program only supported multiple destinations for the same job, I&rsquo;d be ecstatic. You can of course duplicate a job and change the destination, but that&rsquo;s always seemed like a lot of bother to me.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1374195" height="793" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Perfect-Backup-13.png?w=1200" width="1174" /><figcaption>Perfect Backup offers numerous retention options and they&rsquo;re presented in an easy-to-understand fashion.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Perfect Backup</p></div>



<p>Perfect Backup will also back up to network locations, and even FTP sites. You can also back up from network locations, but only if they&rsquo;re mapped as local drives under Windows.</p>



<p>Currently, you need to have Perfect Backup start with Windows for it to perform scheduled jobs. More elegant would be using the the Windows Task Scheduler so the program isn&rsquo;t always in the background using resources. That said, with modern computing power, this isn&rsquo;t nearly the issue it once was.</p>



<h2 id="perfect-backup-interface">Perfect Backup: Interface</h2>



<p>What I really enjoy about the Perfect Backup interface is not so much its logical layout or hand-holding wizard, which are both excellent, but the labels and language. Where so many interfaces are terse, or assume knowledge of terminology, Perfect Backup labels and explains things as normal humans think of them.  </p>



<p>Mostly. I wasn&rsquo;t in love with calling the destination directory for the restore function the &ldquo;output&rdquo; directory. You might feel differently.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1374196" height="830" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Perfect-Backup-18.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Perfect Backup offers just about every option you&rsquo;ll find in any backup program.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Generally, however, the interface&rsquo;s language helps new users feel less intimidated and more sure of their actions. They won&rsquo;t have to waste so much time sussing out concepts and metaphors. </p>



<p>One other thing I did not like was the user&rsquo;s guide being HTML online without a downloadable PDF version. Maybe I&rsquo;m just old-school, but I prefer local documentation. I might be backing up a machine offline when a question pops into my head.</p>



<h2 id="perfect-backup-performance">Perfect Backup: Performance</h2>



<p>Perfect Backup performed, well, perfectly during my tests. At least on a normal PC. I did have some network-related issues under Parallels/Windows 11 on the Mac, but that&rsquo;s not unusual and not many users will be employing that combo.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1374198" height="883" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Pwerfect-Backup-online.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Perfect Backup also backs up to online services. Very few backup programs, paid or not, will do this.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I tried both Zipped and plain file backups, and the former didn&rsquo;t seem to significantly throttle what turned out to be very performance. Restores were also quick and easy, though again, I&rsquo;d prefer the term destination rather than output directory. Both are correct, the former is more common.</p>



<p>Perfect Backup being so useful and well-realized prompted me to reach out to the company to ask why it&rsquo;s free. They informed that that it will remain that way for at least two years, and those who use it now can keep using it for free beyond that. The idea is to get free publicity for the program and eventually garner income from licensing. Fine by me.</p>



<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>



<p>Perfect Backup exceeded my expectations. It&rsquo;s stable and easier than most of the file backup programs out there, and there&rsquo;s no arguing the price. If it created images for disaster recovery, it would be vying for top dog. As it is, it&rsquo;s highly useful and worthy of recommendation. </p>

<p>This approach to online security, also known as two-step authentication, multi-factor authentication, or just 2FA for short, involves combining a regular password with a secondary numeric code, which you must enter on any device where you haven&rsquo;t logged in before. This extra code typically gets sent to your phone, so someone who steals your password can&rsquo;t get into your account unless they have physical access to your phone as well (and know how to unlock it).</p>



<p>The added annoyance of 2FA is well worth the extra security it provides, which is why some tech companies have now started requiring it. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/making-sign-safer-and-more-convenient/&amp;xcust=2-1-1376010-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Google</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/18/21141948/ring-two-factor-authentication-default-mandatory-data-sharing-third-party-analytics-advertising&amp;xcust=2-1-1376010-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Amazon&rsquo;s Ring</a> both made 2FA mandatory last year, and it&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915&amp;xcust=2-1-1376010-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">on by default for most Apple IDs</a>. I&rsquo;ve also noticed Amazon selectively enforcing 2FA on it apps and website, sending a link to click on via text message when you login on a new device.</p>



<p>While these are all positive steps, the smartest approach to 2FA isn&rsquo;t merely passive. Many of these 2FA methods work by texting a code to your phone, which is better than nothing but is susceptible to potentially-devastating <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dmbjx/how-hackers-are-breaking-into-att-tmobile-sprint-to-sim-swap-yeh&amp;xcust=2-1-1376010-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">SIM hijacking attacks</a>. (The FCC is only now starting to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/n7babx/the-fcc-wants-to-force-wireless-carries-to-finally-stop-sim-swapping?__twitter_impression=true&amp;s=09&amp;xcust=2-1-1376010-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">examine that problem</a>.) And if your phone gets lost or stolen, you&rsquo;ll want to have a backup 2FA method at the ready.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re ready to take 2FA more seriously, here are some options to consider:</p>



<h2 id="use-an-authenticator-app">Use an authenticator app</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Authy on Android" class="wp-image-1376017" height="799" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2faphone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Instead of sending 2FA codes by text message, most major online services let you use an authenticator app to generate codes on your phone. The authenticator app syncs up to your online service&mdash;usually by having you scan a one-time QR code&mdash;and from then on, you use the app to look up the code when you&rsquo;re logging in on a new device.</p>



<p>While Google and Microsoft both offer their own authenticator apps that work with a wide range of online services, I personally prefer <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://authy.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1376010-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Authy</a>. It&rsquo;s free, and more importantly, you can install it on multiple devices at the same time. I have Authy installed on my iPhone, Android phone, iPad, Windows desktop, Windows laptop, and Mac Mini, which means my 2FA codes are never out of reach.</p>



<p>This convenience does come with a trade-off: Installing Authy on a new device requires its own authentication code, which Authy can send via text message. But Authy mitigates this in two ways: You must also enter a password to unlock your backups on a new device, and you can always disable the ability to install Authy on new devices. To turn the ability back on, you&rsquo;d need physical access to a device where Authy is already installed.</p>



<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t rely solely on Authy if you&rsquo;re prone to forgetting passwords, because there&rsquo;s no way to recover Authy&rsquo;s if you lose it. But if you want easy access to 2FA codes across multiple devices&mdash;including your computer&mdash;its multi-device support makes it tough to beat.</p>



<h2 id="use-email-or-app-based-2fa-instead-of-text">Use email or app-based 2FA instead of text</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google two-step verification prompt" class="wp-image-1376013" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/google2fa.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever seen the &ldquo;Are you trying to sign in?&rdquo; prompt on your phone when logging into Gmail on a new device, this in itself is a form of 2FA, using an existing sign-in on one device to help you sign in on another. Similarly, some services can send you an extra verification code via email when you log in on a new device.</p>



<p>Either approach is better than getting codes via text message&mdash;at least, if your devices and email account are secure themselves&mdash;and in most cases you can set them up alongside an authenticator app such as Authy. That way, you have multiple methods for getting into your accounts when 2FA is enabled.</p>



<h2 id="use-printed-codes-or-a-security-key-for-extra-backup">Use printed codes or a security key for extra backup</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Yubikey" class="wp-image-1376020" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/yubikey.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>To make doubly sure that you can always get into your account, some services will let you print out backup codes or plug a USB security key into your device for 2FA. Last year, for instance, I set up a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.yubico.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1376010-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Yubico</a> security key with my Gmail, Microsoft, Twitter, and Stripe accounts, so if I ever need to log in on a new device, I can just plug in the key instead of using Authy. You can see which online accounts work with Yubikey <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/?sort=popular&amp;xcust=2-1-1376010-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>



<h2 id="sign-in-with-google-or-apple-when-possible">Sign in with Google or Apple when possible</h2>



<p>Once you&rsquo;ve gone through the trouble of locking down your Google and Apple account, consider using them to log in on other sites whenever that&rsquo;s an option. For instance, I often use &ldquo;Sign in with Google&rdquo; on sites that offer it, as spares me from creating another password and gives that site the same level of security as my Google account.</p>



<h2 id="setting-it-all-up">Setting it all up</h2>



<p>Here&rsquo;s where things get a little tricky: Not every app or online service works with all of the options I just described. Some may not support physical security keys or email-based authentication. Others may not provide printed codes as a backup method. Others still may only offer text-based two-factor authentication, or not offer 2FA at all.</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean you should avoid 2FA entirely. Instead, you should use the best available options for each of your accounts, starting with the ones that store your most important data. If 2FA options are limited or unavailable, it&rsquo;s all the more important to rely on strong passwords&mdash;preferably <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">generated by a password manager</a>.</p>

It comes loaded with all of the best performance features needed with any unnecessary extras. Asus builds their ROG line with gamers in mind and this board is no exception&mdash;PCIe Gen 5 and DDR5 included. It strikes a good balance between high-end design and strong performance features for a reasonable price.</p>
</div>


<p>With the introduction of Intel&rsquo;s 13th-generation Raptor Lake, we&rsquo;ve got some new motherboards to savor. Some of the most finger-lickin&rsquo;-good options have come from the Asus ROG Strix lineups of the past&mdash;packing great features for the price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Will the new Z790 generation keep up the trend and entice you to indulge? Today we&rsquo;re looking at the Asus ROG Strix Z790-E. We&rsquo;ll go over the features, design, and performance. For its $499 MSRP, should this be on the top of your list if you&rsquo;re upgrading to Intel&rsquo;s 13th-gen? Let&rsquo;s find out!</p>



<h2 id="asus-rog-strix-z790-e-the-specs">Asus ROG Strix Z790-E: The Specs</h2>



<p>The Asus ROG Strix Z790-E has traditionally been a great entry point into the higher-end motherboard space. ROG, or &ldquo;Republic of Gamers,&rdquo; branding tends to signify models with more features and gamer-focused niceties on the design side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the basic specs, and then we&rsquo;ll discuss which should matter the most in real-world use cases. Coming in a slightly smaller box than some of the other ROG motherboards, such as the ROG Hero, it still includes some nice accessories: Wi-Fi antenna, ROG stickers, ROG keychain, and other miscellaneous items such as cable ties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good news: Both Intel&rsquo;s 12th- and 13th-gen CPUs will work, along with your previous CPU coolers of the LGA 1200/1151 variety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The specs below really cater to the gamer market&mdash;some content creators may need to step up to the Hero line if they need faster I/O or more SATA ports.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>ATX form factor&nbsp;</li><li>Support for both Intel 12th- and 13th-gen CPUs&nbsp;</li><li>Twin 18+1 Digital VRM with 90 amps</li><li>DDR5 RAM&nbsp;</li><li>PCIe Gen 5 16x slot&nbsp;</li><li>Five M.2 slots, (1x PCIe Gen 5 and 4x PCIe Gen 4)&nbsp;</li><li>HDMI and DisplayPort out&nbsp;</li><li>12 USB ports on back, Including a USB 3.2 Gen 2&times;2 20Gb/s</li><li>Intel Wi-Fi 6E&nbsp;</li><li>Intel 2.5GbE LAN</li><li>RGB Aura Sync header</li><li>4 SATA 6Gb/s ports&nbsp;</li><li>8 PWM fan headers</li><li>BIOS Flashback and Clear CMOS&nbsp;</li><li>Onboard power button</li><li>Audio: ROG SupremeFX with ALC4080 Codec&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Backwards compatible CPU-cooler mounting</li><li>MSRP $499</li></ul><h2 id="asus-rog-strix-z790-e-features">Asus ROG Strix Z790-E: Features</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix Z790-E" class="wp-image-1373198" height="623" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-10-29-at-1.20.39-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The hearty spec list above points to the Strix giving gamers exactly what they need&mdash;and less of what they don&rsquo;t. This board is optimized for gaming in its DNA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PCIe Gen 5 and DDR5 are both here, which can easily keep up with today&rsquo;s PCIe Gen 4 GPUs, including the mighty <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">Nvidia RTX 4090</a>. The new Z790 chipset has stronger DDR5 RAM support compared to Z690, plus faster maximum speeds, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can install as many as five M.2 drives here&mdash;and one of them can even be PCIe Gen 5. While you&rsquo;ll only get four SATA ports, this no-frills approach is exactly what gamers will likely make more use of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>USB ports are abundant, including a single ultra-fast 20Gb/s 3.2 Gen 2&times;2. You won&rsquo;t get Thunderbolt 4 or the faster USB 4 40Gb/s on the back, but Thunderbolt 4 is still available as a header on the motherboard.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix Z790-E" class="wp-image-1373197" height="557" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-10-29-at-1.22.24-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Audio connectivity is competent, with the ROG SupremeFX ALC4080 Codec.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gamers like to build and tinker, and the Strix-E delivers those goodies on the features side too. Clear CMOS for when your overlock goes awry? It&rsquo;s here. Need to do a BIOS flashback? Yep! Plus, we love the onboard start button for those times when your build isn&rsquo;t quite ready yet. To top it off, a handy post-code readout is also included in the top right for diagnostics.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix Z790-E" class="wp-image-1373199" height="755" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-10-29-at-1.21.16-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>A fun extra is the &ldquo;Start&rdquo; button located on the top right of the motherboard.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>There are plenty of &ldquo;quality of life&rdquo; features here that gamers will enjoy,&nbsp;too. Do you like swapping out M.2 drives or GPUs often? Asus has their Q-release and Q-latch systems, making these previously arduous tasks much easier. (I&rsquo;ve lost more M.2 screws than I can count.)</p>



<h2 id="asus-rog-strix-z790-e-design">Asus ROG Strix Z790-E: Design</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix Z790-E" class="wp-image-1373200" height="787" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-10-29-at-1.22.01-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The sleek design of the Asus ROG Strix Z790-E was made for rigs with viewing windows.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The $499 MSRP ROG Strix-E hits the design cues in precisely the way gamers will appreciate. Robust build quality, plus unique touches&mdash;primarily in the clear left cover, make this a winning combination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Attractive M.2 armor also covers the PCIe area of the motherboard, with interesting details everywhere the eye can see. To keep the cost reasonable, the board doesn&rsquo;t have a beefy backplate like you&rsquo;d find on the ROG Hero, but you&rsquo;ll never see that anyway. What it does have is loads of eye candy and creative graphical touches adorned across the front design&mdash;making it a proud addition to your gaming build.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix Z790-E" class="wp-image-1373201" height="789" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-10-29-at-1.21.29-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Asus ROG Strix Z790-E skips the beefy backplate, but you probably won&rsquo;t notice anyways.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The Q-Code display is both functional and aesthetically interesting&mdash;it signifies that this gaming motherboard means business!&nbsp;</p>



<p>The surrounding upper VRM area is beefy and includes some of the aforementioned quirky design elements that the Strix is often known to have.</p>



<h2 id="asus-rog-strix-z790-e-performance-and-bios">Asus ROG Strix Z790-E: Performance and BIOS</h2>



<p>18+1 power stages is plenty even for the mighty Intel Core-i9 13900K. These new CPUs are pushing out higher power and heat than ever before, so this is certainly an area that must be a priority on a gaming motherboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DDR5 RAM also has a more robust implementation over its Z690 predecessor, dual-channel memory capable of overclocking to 7800. The previous Z690 Strix-E typically went to 6400, a nice boost! While you may not be overclocking your RAM that high, Z790 does offer general DDR5 improvements under the radar that will make for better optimization and stability, especially across more than two sticks of RAM. (Z690 typically favored two sticks of RAM only for maximum performance.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Asus BIOS and software suite are back, and they&rsquo;ve been optimized over previous generations. On the software side, Armory Crate is excellent and a jack-of-all-trades. You can set fan profiles, get driver updates, and play with Aura Sync RGB settings. This is great to have under one unified piece of software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the BIOS side, the same easy-to-use UEFI BIOS that Asus is well-regarded for, is here. Easily set memory profiles, fan curves, and loads of CPU-tweaking options if you&rsquo;d like to tinker. Automatic overclocking is also here, which can have varying results based on your cooling solution.</p>

<p>The Asus ROG Strix Z790-E really hits home for those who want the best performance, but don&rsquo;t need extraneous features. It has mighty CPU taming VRMs, and a delightfully playful design that enhances the gamer aesthetic.</p>



<p>The $499 MSRP is certainly more than justified with the awesome included &ldquo;tech upgrades:&rdquo; You will be on the &ldquo;next-gen&rdquo; train here with PCIe Gen 5, DDR5, and support for the latest Intel CPUs.</p>



<p>The Strix-E hits the right balance of &ldquo;high end&rdquo; while still packing great features for the dollar. Those users who need more features will be better served by motherboards such as the Asus ROG Z790 Hero, which offer Thunderbolt 4 (and other features that may be attractive to content creators, too.)</p>



<p>Gamers will find nirvana right around this level, however&mdash;with all the goodies that you want for a great gaming PC build, without the excess that you won&rsquo;t use. Plus, it looks very cool, too!</p>
