## European Commission Member Clarifies Remark Showing Apparent Console Allegiance

<p dir="ltr">The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-is-gaming-industrys-leader-microsoft-says-as-eu-opens-new-investigation-into-activision-blizzard-deal/1100-6509007/">announced an investigation</a> into Microsoft's purchase of Activision Blizzard. Now, the Commission has had to speak out after one staffer made a comment that caused some gamers to believe he might have a certain preference in the ever-churning console war.</p><p dir="ltr">Commission member Ricardo Cardoso said in a tweet that the body was "working to ensure you will still be able to play Call of Duty on other consoles (including my PlayStation)." While this technically describes Microsoft and Activision's position on the matter, given that both companies have repeatedly stated that COD will continue to come out on PlayStation, some felt that Cardoso was expressing his own opinion on the matter, rather than that of the body.</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/european-commission-responds-as-staff-member-says-cod-will-stay-on-my-playstation">statement</a>, the Commission clarified that Cardoso is not involved in the body's investigation, as he works in the Director General for the Internal Market. The investigation is being handled by a separate department, the Directorate General for Competition. The Commission also notes that Cardoso intended his remarks in a personal capacity, as "indicated clearly in his Twitter profile." In other news, retweets are not endorsements.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/european-commission-member-clarifies-remark-showing-apparent-console-allegiance/1100-6509137/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Constantine Director Wants Sequel To Be Rated R

<p dir="ltr">In a new interview, Constantine director Francis Lawrence says with his long-awaited sequel to the 2005 superhero horror film, he will be pushing for a hard R rating. Speaking with <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/constantine-2-sequel-rated-r-keanu-reeves-francis-lawrence/">The Wrap</a>, Lawrence said he wants to do "what people always wanted originally, not the PG-13 version that just happens to get an R" like last time around.</p><p>Lawrence added that although there will be plenty of violence in the next film, he also wants it to be a funny film. "I think John Constantine is a funny character in a darkly comic kind of way," said Lawrence. "I would want to definitely add more of that sarcastic, cynical sense of humor to the story [in the sequel]."</p><p dir="ltr">In December last year, long-languishing hopes for a Constantine sequel got rekindled when Keanu Reeves <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keanu-reeves-is-still-thinking-about-a-constantine-sequel/1100-6499050/">reiterated how much he would love to return to the role of John Constantine</a>. Reeves shared his feelings with Stephen Colbert during a promotional appearance to talk up The Matrix Resurrections. That appearance seemingly gave enough ammunition for Lawrence and producer Akiva Goldsman, to finally get the go-ahead to work on a sequel. Chiefly, DC Comics had a rightful claim to the character, which Lawrence told The Wrap that "all of that craziness with DC" has finally been sorted--opening the way for a sequel nearly 20 years later.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/constantine-director-wants-sequel-to-be-rated-r/1100-6509135/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

For the gamer in your life, there are plenty of options out there, but nothing is more durable (or comforting!) as a themed plush toy. Hug it, squeeze it, or display it on a shelf, a plush toy based on a video game character is a great quick gift that can easily be stuffed into a stocking. If you need a few ideas, we've got three steeply discounted plush suggestions below that you can look at, all designed by specialist company New Game Plush. As an added bonus, all three of these dolls come with a digital game code for Nintendo Switch, so that's essentially two gifts for the price of one.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Black Friday deals</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-black-friday-gaming-and-tech-deals-available-now/2900-4456/">Best Black Friday deals</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-switch-black-friday-deals-official-deals-revealed/2900-4436/">Best Black Friday Nintendo Switch deals</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-black-friday-deals-early-discounts-on-playstation-games-and-more/2900-4448/">Best Black Friday PS5 deals</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-black-friday-deals-early-deals-available-now/2900-4452/">Best Black Friday Xbox deals</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/walmarts-early-black-friday-sale-is-live-check-out-the-best-deals/2900-4446/">Walmart Black Friday deals</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/target-early-black-friday-sale-features-plenty-of-great-gaming-deals/2900-4442/">Target Black Friday deals</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-buy-early-black-friday-sale-check-out-the-best-deals-november-8/2900-4410/">Best Buy Black Friday deals</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-black-friday-laptop-deals-early-deals-on-gaming-laptops-and-macbooks/2900-4449/">Best Black Friday laptop deals</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/black-friday-tv-deals-best-early-discounts-available-now/2900-4447/">Best Black Friday TV deals</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/early-black-friday-deal-lego-super-mario-sets-get-big-discounts/2900-4439/">Lego Super Mario Black Friday deals</a></li></ul><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove (Plush and game code)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056339-shovel-knight.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>$18 (<del>$50</del>)</strong></p><p>Shovel Knight is an indie gaming icon who has appeared in numerous games at this point.

## MLB The Show 22 Discounted To Lowest Price Yet

<p>MLB The Show 22 launched back in April for $70 on current-gen platforms, and unless you were subscribed to Game Pass, you were left paying a pretty penny to play the baseball game. That has changed, however, as GameStop is currently running a deal that slashes the PS5 version down to just $20. </p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/products/mlb-the-show-22---playstation-5/334745.html">See at GameStop</a> </div></div><p><br />MLB The Show 22 is actually on sale on multiple platforms through GameStop, including a $10 price on PS4 and a $20 price on Xbox Series X. However, it's PlayStation owners who stand to get the best deal here, seeing as the game is still available on Xbox Game Pass and likely will remain there until MLB The Show 23's release next year. </p><p>Building on last year's games with improvements to the Road to the Show mode and the best-in-class Diamond Dynasty, MLB The Show 22 is a terrific baseball game. The cover athlete Shohei Ohtani is a two-way phenom, capable of striking batters out and launching towering home runs, and two-way players can change the dynamic of a game.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mlb-the-show-22-discounted-to-lowest-price-yet/1100-6509129/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 is coming hot on the heels of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2's striking <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-no-1-in-launch-month-for-15-years-in-a-row/1100-6509114/">success</a>, and it's more of the battle royale action that fans have come to expect. Now, a release trailer set to Lynyrd Skynyrd's Free Bird shows off the new map's many thrills and spills, as well as a number of surprising changes to the formula. You can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-2-0-and-modern-warfare-2-season-1-release-time-pre-load-details-and-more/1100-6508879/">pre-load</a> it now.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warzone2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#Warzone2</a> is almost here and it's FREE as a 🦅<br />Experience the massive Battle Royale, the all-new DMZ mode, and so much more on November 16 🔥 <a href="https://t.co/ilV6c5CRcm">pic.twitter.com/ilV6c5CRcm</a></p>  — Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1592200691921174537?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">November 14, 2022</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">As expected, Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 is a free battle royale game that serves as an official <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-2-here-are-all-the-details-and-rumors-so-far/1100-6503456/">follow-up</a> to its successful predecessor. Warzone 2.0's new map is called Al Mazrah, and it's a desert environment with rivers, cities, and shanty-towns. It includes several locations from previous Warzone maps, as well as a revamped Gulag that's 2v2 instead of the usual 1v1.</p><p dir="ltr">Warzone 2.0's biggest addition is its DMZ mode, which is apparently an experience modeled after hardcore loot games like Escape from Tarkov. We've also seen rumors and Easter eggs point to a possible <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-players-believe-easter-egg-teases-second-warzone-map/1100-6508924/">second map</a> for the mode coming in the next few months, but that's far from confirmed at the moment. Since the original Warzone continued the story of the Modern Warfare reboot, we may see some developments on that front as well.

<p dir="ltr">Guardians of the Galaxy star Dave Bautista really <em>really</em> wants to be in Netflix's Gears of War movie, indicated by a video the actor posted of himself in the game's iconic armor on Twitter.

<p>A new trademark for "Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections" has been filed by Bandai Namco, a subtitle that was previously used for the Naruto series of games developed by CyberConnect2.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2022/11/bandai-namco-trademarks-ultimate-ninja-storm-connections-in-europe">Gematsu</a>, the <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/">listing was filed in Europe</a>, although no further details were supplied in the online paperwork. The Ultimate Ninja Storm series has been dormant since the last entry in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-4/">Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4</a>, launched all the way back in 2016 for PC, PS4, and Xbox One, as well as a Switch port in 2020. Since then, CyberConnect2 has worked on an Ultimate Ninja Storm trilogy that collected the older games into one big package, a Demon Slayer game, an update of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/jojos-bizarre-adventure-all-star-battle/">Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle</a> for modern systems, and more.</p><p>As for the Naruto franchise, the last couple of years have seen the manga and anime franchise keep a low profile. Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker, a multiplayer take on the series that starred Naruto's son, was released back in 2018 to mixed reviews, and 2019 saw the debut of the mobile game Boruto: Borutical Generations. The most noteworthy Naruto appearance of recent history wasn't even in a standalone game, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-naruto-rivals-skins-bring-more-ninjas-to-the-island-on-june-23/1100-6504768/">Naruto and his friends eventually made their way into the metaverse of Fortnite</a></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ultimate-ninja-storm-connections-trademark-registered-but-is-it-a-new-naruto-game/1100-6509122/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>David Harbour's star definitely took off after Netflix's Stranger Things after years of bit roles and short-lived television dramas, eventually joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe as the Red Guardian in Black Widow. When Marvel's Thunderbolts movie was announced at this year's D23, it was confirmed that Harbour's Red Guardian would be part of the ensemble which includes Wyatt Russell's US Agent and Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova, the second Black Widow.</p><p>While the Thunderbolts movie is just entering pre-production and is scheduled for 2024, Harbour talked about the Marvel movie during press for his upcoming Christmas action movie, Violent Night, and praised his peers.</p><p>"I've loved Wyatt [Russell], and Sebastian [Stan] and Julia [Louis-Dreyfuss'] characters throughout the universe," he told <a href="https://gizmodo.com/thunderbolts-david-harbour-mcu-movie-1849776448">io9</a>. "What [director Jake Schreier] wants to do with Florence's character is very interesting and how I factor into how we develop our relationship is very interesting. And then when you see what Jake and Eric Pearson is trying to fashion, it's really clever...So you have this movie that's, you know, kind of ragtag.”</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/david-harbour-says-thunderbolts-will-drop-a-bomb-on-the-mcu/1100-6509126/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The new Pirates of the Caribbean movie starring Margot Robbie is not going ahead at Disney, it seems. Robbie told <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/margot-robbie-pirates-of-the-caribbean-movie-dead-disney-1235431909/">Vanity Fair</a> that she had been working on a "female-led" Pirates film for some time, but it's not going ahead due to a lack of interest from Disney.</p><p>"We had an idea and we were developing it for a while, ages ago, to have more of a female-led--not totally female-led, but just a different kind of story--which we thought would've been really cool, but I guess they don't want to do it," she said about Disney.</p><p>The film was apparently going to be written by Birds of Prey writer Christina Hodson. There was reportedly a second new film in the works being developed by Craig Mazin (Chernobyl, The Last of Us). Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced the Pirates movies over the years, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-inside-story-of-the-making-of-top-gun-maverick-cs79gww36">said in May this year</a> that both projects were still in development, but according to Robbie, plans might have changed since then for her film specifically.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/margot-robbies-pirates-of-the-caribbean-movie-is-not-going-forward-she-says/1100-6509115/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
