  <p id="LnXwdU">Amazon could lay off as many as 10,000 employees this week, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/technology/amazon-layoffs.html">a new report from <em>The New York Times</em></a>. The move would follow wide-reaching firings at Twitter and Meta; last week, the latter announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23448926/meta-layoffs-2022">it would lay off 11,000 employees</a>.</p>
<p id="94weNs">Amazon’s cuts are likely to focus on the company’s devices business (which includes numerous Alexa-powered products), human resources, and its retail unit. In a reminder of just how massive Amazon has grown, the <em>Times</em> says 10,000 workers would represent 3 percent of the company’s corporate ranks and 1 percent of its overall workforce. </p>

  <p id="w6eDxM">Elizabeth Holmes really doesn’t want to go to prison.

<p id="8s6pL8">Holmes, who claimed her company had the technology to run hundreds of tests based on just a few drops of blood, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22865362/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-verdict-guilty">was found guilty of misleading investors in January</a>. She was convicted on one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and three counts of wire fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentencing of 20 years. Although she wasn’t found guilty of defrauding patients, some allege her faulty tests yielded inaccurate results, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22687026/theranos-patient-bad-test-miscarriage-pregnancy">one patient who claimed the test</a> falsely told her she was suffering...</p>

  <p id="NR9kpa">Bird overstated the revenue it received from its shared electric scooters for at least two years, the company admitted in <a href="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/sec/0001861449-22-000214/0001861449-22-000214.pdf">documents filed</a> (PDF) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission Monday. </p>
<p id="H5C9W0">The phantom revenue was discovered after an audit of financial statements from 2020 and 2021 in which Bird found it was counting as revenue customers’ preloaded “wallet” balances following the completion of certain scooter trips. This revenue “should not have been recorded,” the company said. </p>
<p id="HAWRYU">As a result, Bird said that two years’ worth of financial statements “should no longer be relied upon” and that the company would be late in filing its third quarter earnings report, which was expected later today. A spokesperson for the company did...</p>

  <p id="VbvCN3">The latest Canary build of Google Chrome includes a neat feature that automatically picks a color scheme for the browser based on the wallpaper shown when you open a new tab. The feature was first <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/yumm4o/chrome_canary_can_now_extract_the_main_color_of/">spotted by u/Leopeva64-2 over on Reddit</a>, who shows how changing the new tab wallpaper automatically adjusts the color scheme of the browser’s address bar and interface. It’s previously been possible to manually change Chrome’s color scheme to one of your choosing, but this simplifies the process.</p>
<p id="nMPqQV">According to Google’s software, the feature “enables setting theme color based on background image color when background image is changed in New Tab Page,” and is available on Mac, Windows, and Linux, as well as Google’s own ChromeOS and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630245/google-fuchsia-os-nest-hub-rollout-release-date">Fuchsia...</a></p>
