It's gone this low <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-8-already-on-sale-085600816.html">before</a>, but it never stays on sale for long. If you've been thinking about upgrading or getting your first Apple Watch, now might be a good time to move on it.&nbsp;</p><p>Both the 45mm and 41mm sizes are $50 off, and the deal applies to the midnight, red and silver case colors. The starlight case is still regular price as of this writing. This is the GPS model, without cellular connectivity, so you'll need your phone around to make calls and texts, but with its built-in capabilities, the watch can still track runs, play music and check your heart rate if you <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/use-apple-watch-without-its-paired-iphone-apd0443fb403/watchos">leave your phone behind</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><p>The Apple Watch is our current <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smartwatches-153013118.html">favorite smartwach</a> overall, as it's a robust wearable that balances activity and health tracking with plenty of lifestyle and connectivity features, such as keeping up with podcasts or staying on top of your calendar. And of course, if you're an iPhone user, adding an Apple Watch to the mix is a no-brainer.&nbsp;</p><p>When we <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-8-real-world-test-130031046.html">tested out the Series 8</a> upon its debut, we liked the extended battery life, quick charging and a low power mode that squeezed out an extra two hours of use after the watch ran down to 20 percent. New for the Series 8 are temperature readings (which can help track ovulation) as well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-8-specs-design-price-release-date-171513962.html">crash detection</a>. While the look is pretty unchanged from the Series 7, that's not necessarily a bad thing, particularly if you want that iconic, square Apple Watch look.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, we named the Apple Watch Series 8 the "new best smartwatch," with our reviewer deciding to use it as her primary smartwatch. But like we said, this $50-off deal doesn't tend to stick around long, so you might want to grab it now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Get the latest </em><a href="https://engadget.com/black-friday/"><em>Black Friday</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyber-monday/"><em>Cyber Monday</em></a><em> offers by following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribing to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em>.</em></p>

## The first-ever Xbox transparency report reveals a surge in bot bans

<p>If you've had to deal with a rash of fake Xbox Live accounts in recent times, you're far from alone. Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2022/11/14/xbox-shares-community-safety-approach-in-transparency-report/">published</a> its first-ever Xbox transparency report, and it's now clear the company is banning or otherwise cracking down on bots. The company says it issued over 4.33 million "proactive enforcements" (that is, taking action without user reports) against fake and compromised accounts in the first half of 2022. That represented 57 percent of the enforcement actions over the six-month span, and a ninefold surge in the amount of proactive efforts versus the same period a year ago.</p><p>Microsoft was previously pouring most of its energy into "reactive" enforcement (responses to gamer reports), and taking fewer actions as a whole. The company issued 2.24 million reactive enforcements in the second half of 2021, and just 461,000 proactive measures. Other violations were relatively few and far between. "Adult" content led to just 199,000 proactive enforcements, while fraud, harassment and other abuses each had fewer than 100,000 actions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It won't surprise you to hear that most of Microsoft's 33.08 million user-prompted crackdowns <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-20-xbox-chief-toxicity-abuse-harassment-safety-measures.html">focused on toxic players</a>. Enforcement was equally dominated by reports of cheating and other poor conduct (43 percent) and abusive communication (46 percent). Just 11 percent of enforcements were tied to user-made content like offensive nicknames and screenshots. Thankfully, there appear to be fewer overall incidents — Microsoft received 59.65 million reports in the last half of 2020.</p><p>Don't count on winning an appeal if you think Microsoft made a mistake. Out of more than 151,000 case appeals during the period, just six percent (about 9,250) led to reinstatements.</p><p>You can expect a new Xbox transparency report every six months from now onward. There doesn't appear to be equivalent reports for the equivalent Nintendo and Sony online services. Still, this may be good news if you've wondered about Xbox Live's problem areas, and whether or not Microsoft is taking bots seriously.</p>

## Soft robotic device stimulates muscles, sparks hope for ALS and MS patients

<p>Today, muscle atrophy is often unavoidable when you can't move due to severe injury, old age or diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS). However, Harvard researchers see hope in soft robotics that could someday stretch and contract the muscles of patients unable to do so themselves.</p><p>The Harvard engineers <a href="https://wyss.harvard.edu/news/wasting-muscles-built-back-better/"><ins>tested a new mechanostimulation system</ins></a> on mice, successfully preventing or assisting in their recovery from muscle atrophy. The team implanted the "soft robotic device" on a mouse's hind limb, which they immobilized in a cast-like enclosure for around two weeks. While the control group's untreated muscles wasted away as expected, the actively stimulated muscles showed reduced degradation. The researchers believe their system can eventually lead to implants helping humans with atrophy.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Its promise stems from its ability to induce a small mechanical muscle strain that mirrors natural stimulation during exercise. Moreover, while keeping atrophy at bay, the device didn't lead to any severe tissue inflammation or damage.</p><p>"There is a good chance that distinct soft robotic approaches with their unique effects on muscle tissue could open up disease or injury-specific mechano-therapeutic avenues," said David Mooney, Ph.D., <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6c965be-a8ea-473d-89f4-9754f2675a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nature+Research&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNmM5NjViZS1hOGVhLTQ3M2QtODlmNC05NzU0ZjI2NzVhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0dXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zNDE1NjMtMDIyLTAxMzk2LXgiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImI0YWFhODE2LThmNzYtNDY1YS04MDU0LWQxNjQ3NzM4YTZiMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAS1GtPOQEW2ZnVjLCKayZLZs8pOGmSFYt6sWyZj_eZ_1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41563-022-01396-x"><ins>the paper's</ins></a> senior author and Harvard's Wyss Institute engineering faculty member.</p><figure><img alt="Illustration that zooms in from the patient's body (far left) to the material's composition and interactions with muscle tissue (lower right)" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/e8104aa0-644b-11ed-bf3f-3b333d6b26bc" style="height: 621; width: 1200;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Wyss Institute</div></figure><p>Dubbed MAGENTA (short for "mechanically active gel-elastomer-nitinol tissue adhesive"), the anti-atrophy system includes an engineered spring made from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/nitinol/"><ins>nitinol</ins></a>, a shape memory alloy (SMA) that can rapidly actuate when heated. Researchers control the spring with a wired microprocessor unit that determines the frequency and duration of muscle contractions and stretches.</p><p>The system also includes an elastomer matrix forming the device's body and providing insulation for the heated SMA. In addition, a layer of "tough adhesive" keeps MAGENTA aligned with the muscles' natural movement axis while transmitting stimulation deep into muscle tissue.</p><p>"While untreated muscles and muscles treated with the device but not stimulated significantly wasted away during this period, the actively stimulated muscles showed reduced muscle wasting," said first-author and Wyss Technology Development Fellow Sungmin Nam, Ph.D. "Our approach could also promote the recovery of muscle mass that already had been lost over a three-week period of immobilization, and induce the activation of the major biochemical mechanotransduction pathways known to elicit protein synthesis and muscle growth."</p><p>The team also experimented with a wireless version, using laser light rather than electrical wiring to actuate the SMA spring. Although this approach showed reduced effectiveness due to fat tissue absorbing some of the laser light, the researchers believe this approach still holds potential and warrants further research.</p>

<p>Disney is making one of its best shows of the year more accessible.

Starting November 23rd, the expansion will allow those without access to Disney+ to watch the first two episodes of the Tony Gilroy project. That’s just enough to get a sense of <em>Andor’s</em> smart writing, immaculate production and obsession with institutions, but without seeing the conclusion of its initial arc.</p><p>The announcement comes after the show arguably had its best episode yet<em>. </em>Anchored by a stellar performance by Stellan Skarsgard, “One Way Out” featured a thrilling prison break and was a neat encapsulation of <em>Andor’s</em> many strengths.

## Amazon reportedly plans sweeping layoffs that could affect thousands of employees

<p>Amazon could announce sweeping layoffs as early as this week, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/technology/amazon-layoffs.html"><em><ins>The New York Times</ins></em></a>. The company reportedly plans to cut approximately 10,000 corporate employees, with staff at its consumer-facing devices division among those who are likely to be affected by the move. Amazon employs approximately <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-pay-increase-hourly-workers-warehouses-transportation-083510779.html"><ins>1.5 million people globally</ins></a>. If the company moves forward with the cuts as reported, they would affect about three percent of its corporate workforce and would represent the largest reorganization in Amazon’s nearly 30-year history.</p><p>Amazon did not immediately respond to Engadget’s request for comment. Mass layoffs have been a frequent occurrence in the US tech sector in recent weeks. On November 9th, Facebook parent company Meta cut about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-mass-layoffs-facebook-111406126.html"><ins>13 percent of its workforce</ins></a>, a move that saw more than 11,000 people lose their jobs at the social media giant. Before that, Twitter was decimated after Elon Musk ordered a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-layoffs-010148183.html"><ins>50 percent reducation</ins></a> of the company’s headcount. Over the weekend, the company also let go of most of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-reportedly-cuts-contract-workers-173755779.html"><ins>contract workers</ins></a>. Smaller firms like Lyft and Snap have laid off employees in recent months as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For Amazon, the planned layoffs are reflective of the company's changing fortunes. Thanks to early pandemic lockdown measures, the retail giant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-q1-2021-210221698.html"><ins>experienced record growth</ins></a> and went on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-16-amazon-hiring-warehouse-delivery-workers.html"><ins>hiring spree</ins></a> that saw its workforce double. In recent months, however, the company has seen growth slow due to a combination of mounting costs and the return of in-person shopping. The company recently <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220727006066/en/"><ins>posted a $2 billion loss</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-corporate-hiring-freeze-200453634.html"><ins>froze hiring at its corporate offices</ins></a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google/"><ins>Google</ins></a> has agreed to pay $391.5 million to settle charges brought forth by 40 attorneys general. They accused the company of misleading users into believing they had turned off <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/location%20tracking/"><ins>location tracking</ins></a> in their settings, but Google continued to collect information about their movements. As part of the settlement, Google has agreed to "significantly improve" its location tracking disclosures and user controls starting next year.</p><p>“For years Google has prioritized profit over their users’ privacy,” Oregon attorney general Ellen Rosenblum, who led the case along with Nebraska AG Doug Peterson, <a href="https://www.doj.state.or.us/media-home/news-media-releases/largest-ag-consumer-privacy-settlement-in-u-s-history/"><ins>said in a statement</ins></a>. “They have been crafty and deceptive. Consumers thought they had turned off their location tracking features on Google, but the company continued to secretly record their movements and use that information for advertisers.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The AGs opened the investigation in 2018 following an <em>Associated Press</em> report suggesting that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-17-how-google-location-tracking-issue-affects-you.html"><ins>Google tracks location data even after users ask it not to</ins></a>. The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-america-science-technology-business-ap-top-news-828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb"><ins>report</ins></a> indicated that turning off the Location History setting didn't stop Google from knowing where a user was. Some apps, such as Maps and Search, still created a snapshot of their location on their Google account.

This supports <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/health-and-fitness/health-connect/data-and-data-types/data-types"><ins>more than 40 data types</ins></a> across six categories: activity, body measurement, cycle tracking, nutrition, sleep and vitals. Google notes that it only takes a few lines of code for apps to read and write any of these data types through Health Connect.</p><p>One of the key benefits for users is that they'll be able to manage permissions for all these integrations in one place. Health Connect includes granular controls over which types of data each third-party app can access. You can also block all apps from accessing Health Connect data with a couple of taps.</p>

## Waymo is using its self-driving taxis to create real-time weather maps

<p>Self-driving cars frequently have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-self-driving-vehicle-dataset-192308540.html">trouble with poor weather</a>, but Waymo thinks it can overcome these limitations by using its autonomous taxis as weather gauges. The company has <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2022/11/using-cutting-edge-weather-research-to-advance-the-Waymo-Driver.html">revealed</a> that its latest car sensor arrays are creating real-time weather maps to improve ride hailing services in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-phoenix-public-193945960.html">Phoenix</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-driverless-taxi-permit-california-dmv-150046627.html">San Francisco</a>. The vehicles measure the raindrops on windows to detect the intensity of conditions like fog or rain.</p><p>The technology gives Waymo a much finer-grained view of conditions than it gets from airport weather stations, radar and satellites. It can track the coastal fog as it rolls inland, or drizzle that radar would normally miss. While that's not as important in a dry locale like Phoenix, it can be vital in San Francisco and other cities where the weather can vary wildly between neighborhoods.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are a number of practical advantages to gathering this data, as you might guess. Waymo is using the info to improve its Driver AI's ability to handle rough weather, including more realistic simulations. The company also believes it can better understand the limits of its cars and set higher requirements for new self-driving systems. The tech also helps Waymo One better serve ride hailing passengers at a given time and place, and gives <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-freight-waymo-via-long-haul-autonomous-trucking-173218101.html">Waymo Via</a> trucking customers more accurate delivery updates.</p><p>The current weather maps have their limitations. They may help in a warm city like San Francisco, where condensation and puddles are usually the greatest problems, but they won't be as useful for navigating snowy climates where merely seeing the lanes can be a challenge. There's also the question of whether or not it's ideal to have cars measure the very conditions that hamper their driving. This isn't necessarily the safest approach.</p><p>This could still go a long way toward making Waymo's driverless service more practical, though. Right now, companies like Waymo and Cruise <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-cruise-approval-driverless-rides-california-070950457.html">aren't allowed to operate in heavy rain</a> or fog using their California permits — the weather monitoring could help these robotaxi firms serve customers looking for dry rides home.</p>

Last week, the company announced Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ had a combined customer base of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-streaming-services-earnings-055415800.html"><ins>236 million subscribers</ins></a>, putting the company in the ballpark of Netflix’s numbers. At the same time, Disney said operating losses for streaming increased from $0.8 billion to $1.5 billion during its most recent fiscal quarter. Moving forward, Walt Disney CEO Bob Chapek said the company expects those losses to narrow, partly thanks to the price increases it announced earlier this year.</p>

All of that should keep it performing better in the long-term. It also has a WiFi 6 radio, if you have or ever plan to upgrade to a router that supports that. The Fire TV Stick 4K is still a solid alternative if you want to save a few bucks: It's physically identical to the 4K Max, has the same voice remote and still supports Dolby Vision, HDR10+ and HDR10, plus Dolby Atmos for audio. Like all Fire TV Sticks, it still supports just about all of the major streaming apps. It's just a bit less performant.</p><p>If you're shopping for an older TV or don't need 4K streaming, the Fire TV Stick Lite and base Fire TV Stick max out at a 1080p resolution but offer most of the essentials at a lower cost. They both run the same interface as the 4K models and work with HDR10, HDR10+ and HLG, though there's no Dolby Vision support, and they're both more prone to sluggishness when swapping between apps and Amazon's home screen. The main difference between the two is the remote: The Fire TV Stick's has buttons for volume, mute, power, and app shortcuts, while the Fire TV Stick Lite's doesn't. The Fire TV Stick can also output Dolby Atmos audio to a compatible sound system. If you can live without those, though, the Lite is more or less the same streamer for a few bucks less.</p><p>With every Fire TV streamer, you still have to deal with an ad-heavy interface that heavily pushes you toward Amazon's own apps and services. Roku and Google still sell <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html">compelling alternatives</a> around the same prices; the former offers a more straightforward UI, the latter has more comprehensive search and is better about proactively recommending shows you might like, and both give similar performance. If you prefer one of those platforms, we're still seeing deals on those devices as well: <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Sb2t1LVN0cmVhbWluZy1EZXZpY2UtVmlzaW9uLUNvbnRyb2xzL2RwL0IwOUJLQ0RYWkM_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tNHUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE1NTJiNDAyLTE5ZjQtNDIwMC1hMWY3LTZlYjM4NjY2YWUwOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAR9dAHxqCmphSXcYejovx-hCQB-vbx1vuM_DszsHnj20&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRoku-Streaming-Device-Vision-Controls%2Fdp%2FB09BKCDXZC">Roku's Streaming Stick 4K</a> is currently on sale for $25, while Google's <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DaHJvbWVjYXN0LUdvb2dsZS1UVi1TdHJlYW1pbmctRW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9kcC9CMEI5SFM2RExaP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTR1LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNTUyYjQwMi0xOWY0LTQyMDAtYTFmNy02ZWIzODY2NmFlMDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATZfOQ_FTc-zN6F-q_WyLrYBoNBL2GShfOspNex0ZoK4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FChromecast-Google-TV-Streaming-Entertainment%2Fdp%2FB0B9HS6DLZ">1080p</a> and <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Hb29nbGUtTmVzdC1HQTAxOTE5LUdBMDE5MTktVVMtQ2hyb21lY2FzdC9kcC9CMDhLUlY3UzIyP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTR1LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNTUyYjQwMi0xOWY0LTQyMDAtYTFmNy02ZWIzODY2NmFlMDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeDqIbh24CWewfFWwiCjMKFX8bJVN6tMNOSpwnvsp-Me&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGoogle-Nest-GA01919-GA01919-US-Chromecast%2Fdp%2FB08KRV7S22">4K Chromecasts</a> are down to $18 and $40, respectively.

## 'The Witcher 3' finally hits PS5 and Xbox Series X/S on December 14th

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/cd%20projekt%20red/">CD Projekt Red</a> has revealed that the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/THE%20WITCHER%203/"><em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em></a> will finally be available on December 14th. The studio hasn't shown off what gameplay looks like on those consoles or many details about what's in store, but it plans to reveal more during a livestream event sometime next week.</p><p>The upgrade will be free for those who bought any version of the game, which debuted in 2015, on PS4 or Xbox One, respectively. PC players will benefit from the update too. CD Projekt Red previously said the current-gen version of <em>The Witcher 3</em> would include ray tracing and faster load times, as well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-netflix-dlc-214822084.html">free downloadable content</a> inspired by the Netflix series <em>The Witcher2015 </em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="34679ad8b7fd436e8b57c0bf45ae4944"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The next-gen update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is coming on December 14th, free for everyone who already owns the game. <br /><br />For more details and gameplay reveal, tune in to REDstreams next week on <a href="https://t.co/IpFERTohi9">https://t.co/IpFERTohi9</a>. <a href="https://t.co/fg3yfGeNih">pic.twitter.com/fg3yfGeNih</a></p>— The Witcher (@witchergame) <a href="https://twitter.com/witchergame/status/1592177211481944068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>CDPR announced the current-gen version of the game <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-witcher-3-next-gen-consoles-133730357.html">back in September 2020</a>.

The publisher <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-xbox-series-xs-release-date-160532406.html">released the latter in February</a>. However, it ran into some issues with <em>The Witcher 3</em>. In April, CDPR said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-ps5-xbox-series-x-delay-183832784.html">work on the upgrade in-house</a> after initially outsourcing it to Saber Interactive.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-edgerunners-popularity-spike-161756943.html">saw a huge surge in interest</a> earlier this year thanks to the (excellent) current-gen update and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-netflixs-cyberpunk-2077-anime-series-trailer-085217619.html"><em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em></a> anime series on Netflix. Perhaps this upgrade will cause <em>The Witcher 3</em>'s player count to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-30-the-witcher-3-more-popular-on-steam-than-at-launch.html">spike again</a>. Netflix's upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-teaser-210014672.html">prequel to <em>The Witcher</em></a> could draw more eyes to the game too.</p>

The apparel maker has <a href="https://about.nike.com/en/newsroom/releases/nike-launches-swoosh-a-new-digital-community-and-experience">introduced</a> ".Swoosh," a blockchain-based platform that will let members collect and eventually create virtual jerseys, shoes and other goods they can wear in games and other online spaces. You may get access to real-world products and special events, too. The creation of an "inclusive" community is important, Nike says, although the company isn't shy about wanting to make money — you can buy virtual products using conventional payments, much like you would a physical pair of runners.</p><p>The .Swoosh platform is currently in beta. Sign-ups start November 18th, and you'll need an access code if you want to avoid sitting on a waiting list. Nike doesn't start official "programming" until December, and the first community-shaped virtual collection is poised to launch in early 2023. The brand's initial community building will focus on the US and some European countries.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Nike also hinted at how it will motivate some creators. After that first collection arrives, the firm will launch a community challenge that gives winners a chance to co-create virtual items with Nike. They'll earn a royalty on whatever products they ultimately sell.</p><p>The debut comes just under a year after Nike bought RTFKT to accelerate its virtual goods business, and represents its first major push into the field. Nike also faces some competition from athletics wear rivals eager to profit from the blockchain. Adidas has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adidas-nft-drop-earnings-165112219.html">participated in NFT drops</a>, for instance, while Reebok has <a href="https://twitter.com/reebok/status/1386681507801190403">released</a> its own collectible items. The .Swoosh rollout could help Nike counter those challenges by creating a go-to hub for digtally-savvy fans.</p>

## Amazon's Alexa caregiver service now allows custom alerts

It's currently available only in the US and requires Amazon accounts for both the caregiver and the care recipient.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Alexa Together offers a number of remote aids, such as 24/7 urgent-care responses, remote assistance for features like reminders, and fall detection with compatible sensors. It was developed at the height of the pandemic, when in-person care was frequently impractical, but is also pitched as a way to grant independence to the elderly and others who might otherwise need physical check-ins.</p><p>It's easy to imagine privacy concerns. If an intruder got access, they could learn when a family member leaves home or wakes up. Amazon notes that there are "multiple layers" of protection, however, including limited info in the activity feed and the power to revoke permission. It's really a question of whether or not both sides of an Alexa Together setup are comfortable with the added level of detail.</p>

Thanks to the latest round of hardware from Intel, Apple, AMD and NVIDIA, all of our portable devices have gotten faster and more efficient. Even the cheapest iPad can be a decent productivity machine, while gaming laptops can almost match the power of their desktop siblings. And now that Windows 11 has proven very stable over the past year, it's a perfect time to give someone a nifty PC upgrade.</p><h2>Dell XPS 13</h2><figure><img alt="Dell XPS 13" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/170bef50-5a13-11ed-9c63-05b4f60cdc34" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>Not to sound like a broken record, but the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b1bb23c9-a2d4-4e4e-bfac-7a560ebe7641&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dell&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiMWJiMjNjOS1hMmQ0LTRlNGUtYmZhYy03YTU2MGViZTc2NDEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVsbC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2hvcC9kZWxsLWxhcHRvcHMveHBzLTEzLWxhcHRvcC9zcGQveHBzLTEzLTkzMTUtbGFwdG9wIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzNDAzNjYzNi0xN2U4LTMzMmYtYTdhZS03NDMyN2Q5N2IzMTUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASz7Ubhi69ZIxtqhLMFdS5iK-i0X1_R2rnD1gI0_dY_x&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fxps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9315-laptop">XPS 13</a> is still one of the best Windows ultraportables you can buy. This year, Dell also streamlined its design to be even slimmer and lighter than before. The result is a laptop that’s easy to carry all day, and a joy to behold thanks to its incredibly thin screen bezels. It’s been upgraded to lower-wattage Intel 12th-gen processors, which is a boon for battery life without sacrificing much performance. The XPS 13 can also be configured with an OLED screen, an ideal gift for someone who could use a bright and color accurate display. If you’re looking for better performance and even more striking design, Dell’s new XPS 13 Plus is also a great gift option.

If portability is a greater concern, take a look at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-14-review-amd-ryzen-173003809.html">Razer Blade 14</a>, a sub-four-pound notebook sporting AMD's latest processors.</p><a class="athena-button rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOVJCSkM4WTkvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTRzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzNDAzNjYzNi0xN2U4LTMzMmYtYTdhZS03NDMyN2Q5N2IzMTUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATU-MlVkAyqqqwfhCsj9o2Wan4O0AVWgu8r8G3FyqzVt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09RBJC8Y9%2F" id="8cd897b99e424a8c9b3f643a8bc9b9ce">Buy Razer Blade 15 at Amazon - $3,000</a><h2>ASUS Zephyrus G14</h2><figure><img alt="ASUS Zephyrus G14" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/76824240-5a13-11ed-bfdf-071e2c8e8fb7" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>ASUS’s excellent <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOUhHTTFXSjcvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTRyLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzNDAzNjYzNi0xN2U4LTMzMmYtYTdhZS03NDMyN2Q5N2IzMTUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZZTLOoSh0GrEl6rDIufJH_0tgDjtAccUx0FOhKJtGO_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09HGM1WJ7%2F">Zephyrus G14</a> gaming laptop is back, and this time it finally has a webcam. (That fixes our one main flaw with the original model.) The G14 remains one of the best 14-inch gaming laptops around, with the power of AMD’s Ryzen 9 6900HS chip and either Radeon 6700S or 6800S graphics. That’s pretty impressive for a computer that starts at just 3.6 pounds. You can choose between 1080p 144Hz or 1,440p 120Hz screens, both of which look fantastic. The G14 can appear flashy, thanks to its optional rear LED panel, but it can also do double duty as an attractive productivity PC. It’s a gaming machine that won’t look out of place in a lecture hall, making it ideal for students who don’t want to draw too much attention while they’re watching Twitch streams during class.</p><a class="athena-button rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOUhHTTFXSjcvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTRzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzNDAzNjYzNi0xN2U4LTMzMmYtYTdhZS03NDMyN2Q5N2IzMTUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQkhpuzmn7XFR_J5BPJAe5x7LnnyQm1ofBXRmwqlGFMA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09HGM1WJ7%2F" id="904f96a84bc74392b9512a7ba4d25290">Buy ASUS Zephyrus G14 at Amazon - $1,100</a><h2>Microsoft Surface Laptop Go 2</h2><figure><img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop Go 2" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/870abde0-5a13-11ed-9bee-7b758447973e" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>We called the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOVgxWkxON0cvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTRyLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzNDAzNjYzNi0xN2U4LTMzMmYtYTdhZS03NDMyN2Q5N2IzMTUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfR0G4AZw-VPd4L_e155DTPOFU_3_o28bGID_KGTPgdX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09X1ZLN7G%2F">Surface Laptop Go 2</a> “basic, but in a good way” in our review, and that pretty much says it all.

## Jeff Bezos plans to give most of his money to charity

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeff-bezos-amazon-ceo-final-date-174948346.html">Former Amazon chief</a> Jeff Bezos is the latest tech CEO hoping to be known for his philanthropy. The Amazon founder told <em>CNN</em> in an <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/14/business/jeff-bezos-charity/">interview</a> that he intends to give most of his net worth (currently $124 billion) to charity during his lifetime. Most of it will go toward either countering climate change or supporting those who can create "unity" for humanity. While Bezos shared few details, he and partner Lauren Sánchez said they were "building the capacity" to give this fortune to others and hope to make the most of the investment.</p><p>Before the revelation, Bezos <a href="https://twitter.com/DollyParton/status/1591600947972935680">announced</a> a $100 million donation to singer and literacy advocate Dolly Parton. The executive previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-17-jeff-bezos-10-billion-climate-change-fund.html">pledged $10 billion</a> over the course of a decade to the Bezos Earth Fund, which aims to drive political and technological solutions to human-made climate change. Bezos' ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, has already given away about $4 billion to organizations in the past several months.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="1c991c381b614bc9a265a296a3bfb73c"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We’ve just announced a new Courage and Civility award recipient —  <a href="https://twitter.com/DollyParton?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DollyParton</a>, who leads with her heart, and will put this $100 million award to great use helping so many people. She joins prior awardees, <a href="https://twitter.com/VanJones68?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@VanJones68</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chefjoseandres?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Chefjoseandres</a>.  Congrats, Dolly! <a href="https://t.co/dzTuoGVp3G">pic.twitter.com/dzTuoGVp3G</a></p>— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1591558804960854017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>The strategy is familiar. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is well-known for donating to charities and scientific research through the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and (along with Warren Buffett) founded The Giving Pledge to encourage billionaires to contribute at least half of their money to good causes. In 2015, Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg promised to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-01-mark-zuckerberg-will-donate-99-percent-of-his-facebook-shares.html">donate 99 percent</a> of his company shares, then worth $45 billion, to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. The Facebook creator signed The Giving Pledge in 2010. Bezos hasn't signed the pledge, although this move would qualify.</p><p>As with other tech CEOs making large donations, though, Bezos faces criticism over his legacy. Amazon has repeatedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-amazon-disney-microsoft-climate-bill-lobbyist-opposition-161736552.html">fought climate legislation</a>, and saw its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-annual-susainability-report-2022-carbon-emissions-230707953.html">emissions spike in 2021</a> despite a commitment to reducing its environmental impact. And while he has argued that Amazon needs to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-200-million-prime-subscribers-165713430.html">treat its employees better</a>, the rough warehouse working conditions at the heart of the issue <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-workers-sue-over-covid-19-guidelines-164638980.html">emerged under his watch</a>.</p><p>There are also questions as to why he waited until now to give most of his money to charity. While he has often made charitable pledges, he has also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-01-jeff-bezos-plan-rich-people.html">poured funds into side projects</a> that haven't done much to advance humanity, at least not in the short term — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/in-2021-billionaires-headed-to-the-stars-210013764.html">sending rich people into space</a> with Blue Origin, for example. As with Gates and Zuckerberg, there's a concern Bezos is trying to mend his reputation by offloading most of his wealth.</p>

## Roku's Streambar falls back down to a record low of $80

<p>You don't always need to invest in a brand new TV or an expensive sound system to up your home-entertainment game. A soundbar could do the trick, providing much better audio quality than most TVs offer and costing much less than a whole sound system. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Sb2t1LVN0cmVhbWJhci1TdHJlYW1pbmctUHJlbWl1bS1SZWxlYXNlZC9kcC9CMDhHOEpIODM2Lz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTRvLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzMDc1MGIwMy0wYzE2LTQxZTQtYTdlOC1hM2UwZGJjM2U0NGMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdurqdHmrbQ94xdFrWTM6zMRXF0O-R8F0mDiR9hfaz44&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRoku-Streambar-Streaming-Premium-Released%2Fdp%2FB08G8JH836%2F%3Fth%3D1">Roku's Streambar</a> is arguably one of the most convenient options available now, and it's even cheaper ahead of Black Friday. You can pick up the compact device for only $80 right now, which is $50 less than usual and the lowest we've seen it.</p><p></p><p>We gave the Streambar a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-streambar-review-133013675.html">score of 86</a> when it first came out because it not only provides a solid sound upgrade for most TVs, but it also includes 4K streaming technology inside. That means if you have an old set that isn't smart, you can turn it into a smart TV with the Streambar — no additional device required. It supports 4K HDR content and it'll give you access to more streaming services than you'll likely be able to use, including the big ones like Netflix, Prime Video, HBO Max and others.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for audio, the Stremabar supports Dolby Atmos and really makes sound effects and music in TV shows and movies pop. It doesn't quite replicate the feeling of being in a movie theater of course, but it certainly makes your viewing experience more cinematic by upping overall sound quality. It can also double as a Bluetooth speaker, which will be useful if you want just one device in your living room that can do many things.</p><p>The Streambar also has the advantage of being relatively small. It's roughly the size of a carton eggs, and its fabric-wrapped design is pretty attractive, if a little basic. It's much smaller than other soundbars, so it'll fit into even the most cramped of living-room setups.</p><p>But if audio isn't your biggest concern and you just want a reliable yet affordable streaming device, there are a couple of other Roku deals worth considering right now.

The biggest change is the new H2 chip that delivers improved noise cancellation and longer battery life.

<p>Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts chastised Elon Musk on Sunday after the billionaire’s glib response to a request for information about Twitter’s new verification policies. “Perhaps it is because your real account sounds like a parody?” Musk tweeted Sunday morning after Markey criticized the company’s new $8 per month Twitter Blue subscription.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/senator-ed-markey-tells-elon-musk-fix-your-companies-215557841.html">Senator Markey countered</a>: “One of your companies is under an FTC consent decree.

With a new CEO onboard – former Microsoft executive Peggy Johnson – it's aiming for something far more practical: AR for the enterprise. It’s a retread of the HoloLens playbook, sure, but according to Devindra Hardawar, after the endless drumbeat of metaverse hype (mostly from Meta), it’s nice to be genuinely surprised by a new headset.

## The original 1997 'Berserk' anime is coming to Netflix on December 1st

<p><em>Berserk</em>, the long-running manga that married fantasy and, well, violence, is coming back to the small screen. The original 25-episode 1997 anime series based on the manga and directed by Naohito Takahashi is coming to Netflix on December 1st, according to <a href="https://comicbook.com/anime/news/berserk-original-anime-netflix-release-date/"><em>ComicBook.com</em></a>.</p><p>As is clear from the trailer below, <em>Berserk</em> is a pitch black and fairly brutal anime that came some eight years after the manga first appeared in <em>Young Animal</em> magazine. The series covers the so-called Golden Age Arc, covering the period when Guts joined the Band Of the Hawk and met the other primary characters, Griffith and Casca. It's considered by some fans to be the best take on the manga, and is said to have inspired or influenced major anime hits like <em>Fullmetal Alchemist </em>and <em>Attack on Titan</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="9d17e1df34f54ceeac03d01ead30e333"></div><p>The release of Berserk material from Netflix seemed a fait accompli when it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-nippon-tv-deal-160813690.html">announced</a> that the streaming service had secured the rights to that franchise, along with <em>Parasyte</em>, <em>Monster</em> and other classic anime. In addition, new material could be coming soon as well, according to a <a href="https://berserk-me.com/">countdown clock</a> that appeared recently on Berserk's official website, pointing to a date in mid-December. Nothing is official yet, but it looks like promising times for fans of the franchise.&nbsp;</p>
