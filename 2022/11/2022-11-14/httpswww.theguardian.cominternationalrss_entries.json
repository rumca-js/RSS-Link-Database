He played in the semi-mythical Flowers of Romance with Sid Vicious and Viv Albertine.

He was steadfast in the belief that \u201cyou have to do the work if you want to be good at guitar\u201d, a line that ran contrary to punk\u2019s anyone-can-do-it ethos. He was not interested in \u201cputting together three chord songs\u201d, which was very much the point of punk, suggesting instead that what you needed to do was \u201cput together a situation where there would be no musical limits\u201d, citing the Beatles or the Grateful Dead \u2013 not artists that punk bands were supposed to aspire to \u2013 as examples. He lobbied the band\u2019s manager Bernard Rhodes to include a synthesiser in the lineup, like the ones he\u2019d seen Rick Wakeman playing while working for Yes. He got Joe Strummer to join the band \u2013 in part by demonstrating to Strummer how well he could play Led Zeppelin songs \u2013 then turned their new frontman\u2019s guitar down at rehearsals and gigs, believing him to an insufficiently competent musician.

They had started the band just a few months earlier and were yet to own a drum kit; after hearing one of their songs, the previous band refused to loan them theirs. Instead, the trio settled on a garbage can from the street. \u201cIt was no big deal,\u201d Johnson recalls nonchalantly. The band were accustomed to improvising: throughout their career, they famously used empty yoghurt pots, cardboard boxes and a string of borrowed kits in lieu of their own, while crafting askew melodies from thrift shop-bought guitars and masking inexperience with an Echoplex.</p><p>This initiative and open-minded approach to music was core to Beat Happening, who favoured rudimentary song structures, matter-of-fact lyrics and unadulterated emotion. They formed in Olympia, Washington, an unassuming city in the Pacific north-west that was home to an exciting independent music scene. Johnson and Lewis attended Evergreen State College, a local liberal arts institution that encouraged extracurricular activities and creative pursuits; the campus radio station, Kaos, where Johnson had worked from the age of 15, adopted a policy that 80% of music broadcast must be from independent labels. Johnson\u2019s own label K Records, which would go on to release all of Beat Happening\u2019s albums, followed suit, adopting the mission statement: \u201cK explodes the teenage underground into passionate revolt against the corporate ogre world-wide.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/14/beat-happening-it-was-about-having-this-adventure-with-your-friends\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/14/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-sentencing-fraud", "title": "Elizabeth Holmes to be sentenced this week as Theranos saga nears conclusion", "date_published": "2022-11-14 11:00:38+00:00", "description": "<p>The blood testing company\u2019s founder could serve up to 20 years in prison after she was convicted in January for four counts of fraud</p><p>Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, will be sentenced this week to up to 20 years in prison for her role in the blood testing company that tumbled from the heights of Silicon Valley after its fraudulent claims were exposed.</p><p>The sentencing is set to take place in a California courtroom on Friday, after a federal judge denied Holmes\u2019s request for a new trial last week.
