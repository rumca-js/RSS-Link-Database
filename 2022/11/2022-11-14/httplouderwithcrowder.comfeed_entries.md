## Did Elon Musk fire a yappy insubordinate employee LIVE on Twitter?

November 14th, 2022. We have hit peak Elon Musk. Our dude may have fired someone FROM Twitter ON Twitter. Not that I'm one to revel in people losing their jobs. But in this case, let's all have a hearty LOL.</p><p>Our tale begins with Elon Musk informing Twitter users why the app is performing slowly in various countries. An employee of Elon's at the company Elon is CEO of thought calling him a liar in public was a good idea.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I have spent ~6yrs working on Twitter for Android and can say this is wrong. <a href="https://t.co/sh30ZxpD0N">https://t.co/sh30ZxpD0N</a><br />‚Äî Eric Frohnhoefer @ üè° (@EricFrohnhoefer) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricFrohnhoefer/status/1591902285403418624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>As you can imagine, there were Twitter users who felt this was an odd thing to do. Eric didn't care. It was Musk's fault for not using Slack to communicate.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Maybe he should ask questions privately. Maybe using Slack or email. ü§∑‚ôÇÔ∏è<br />‚Äî Eric Frohnhoefer @ üè° (@EricFrohnhoefer) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricFrohnhoefer/status/1591990727852298245?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Funny thing about Elon Musk? He is on Twitter. A LOT. I'm not sure if you've noticed. When other users pointed out the insubordination, Musk did the only thing you could expect him to do.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">He‚Äôs fired<br />‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1592186302379982849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>This could be sarcasm. Or, Elon had security positioned outside of Eric's cubicle. Immediately after hitting "send tweet" he executed Order 69-420. Without warning, Eric had all of his belongings thrown into a cardboard box and he was dragged out of the office. Eric was replaced by an android who doesn't ask questions.</p><p>Some lessons get learned the hard way. Like when your boss <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-twitter-managers" target="_blank">is looking to make cuts</a>, don't <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-twitter-advertisers" target="_blank">give him an excuse</a> to make cuts.</p><p><p>

The first period runs from Primary Day to Election Day, where we support who the voters selected, or at the very least not sh*t on them. The second period runs from Election Day to Primary Day, where we criticize how we got to this point, who is to blame, and promise to pick better candidates. We're still in the first period because there is the Georgia Senate Runoff between Herschel Walker and Sen. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/georgia-warnock-repent-whiteness" target="_blank">Raphael Warnock</a>.</p><p>To get a sense of how important this race is, here's my friend Nathan to explain:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">People, if Herschel Walker loses, Democrats get to do everything they want to in Senate committees.<br /><br />If it is 50/50, the committees are even and it makes much harder for Democrats to do bad things.<br /><br />So it does matter. Also one fewer seat to win back in 2024. Also Warnock is bad.<br />‚Äî Nathan Wurtzel (@NathanWurtzel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NathanWurtzel/status/1591934632156463105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>If Herschel Walker loses, Democrats get to do everything they want to in Senate committees. If we maintain the status quo with a 50/50 split, the Senate committees are even and it makes it much harder for Democrats to do bad things over the next two years until the GOP attempts to get our act together again.</p><p>Also with a 51/49 split, we lose relying on Joe Manchin and Kyrstten Sinema to side with us unless they both do it together. Manchin <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-gates-joe-manchin" target="_blank">showed he'll sell out his constituents for Democrat power</a>. And I'm sure Sinema knows how to math.</p><p>Would I have preferred the 54-46 split everyone was expecting, yes. Should everyone who claims to be a Republican leader no longer be a Republican leader after this debacle? Also yes.  <a href="https://townhall.com/columnists/kurtschlichter/2022/11/14/lets-talk-about-trump-n2615884" target="_blank">All of them</a>. We can argue about all of that on December 7th.</p><p>Right now, there is still a chance for Walker. There won't be a libertarian candidate f*cking things up with their 1.5% of the vote. There WILL BE <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/georgia-brian-kemp-biden-abrams" target="_blank">Gov. Brian Kemp's</a> campaign operation that led him to an eight-point victory last Tuesday.</p><p>There is still work to be done. Let's do it.</p><p><p>

However, corporate media (who hates Musk) and the Democrat Party (who hates Musk) colluding on the issue doesn't send the message they think it does.</p><p>Anyone who paid $8 could be verified, and some users took the opportunity for shenanigans. Most notably, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/eli-lilly-stock-dip-twitter" target="_blank">a Big Pharma company plummeting in the stock market over a parody</a> and really dumb investors. The<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/washington-post-elon-musk-bezos" target="_blank"> billionaire-owned Washington Post</a>, who thinks it's <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-wapo-free" target="_blank">wrong for a billionaire to own a media company</a>, took the opportunity to work with a Democrat Senator Ed Markey over it. Markey, being one of the lead Democrat senators who criticizes Big Tech companies for allowing a flow of opinions and viewpoints he doesn't like that he labels "misinformation."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">A <a href="https://twitter.com/washingtonpost?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@washingtonpost</a> reporter collaborated with a sitting US Senator to trick <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@elonmusk</a> with a hoax. Now the Senator is threatening Musk with action from Congress based on this hoax.<br /><br />Media & elected government officials are working together to prompt investigations into Elon Musk. <a href="https://t.co/Fyk7wztjCQ">pic.twitter.com/Fyk7wztjCQ</a><br />‚Äî Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) <a href="https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1591954636512321536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>First, we have the <em>Washington Post</em> working WITH the Democrat Senator to sign up for a verified Twitter account pretending to be the Senator.</p><p>Then, Senator Markey uses the incident as an excuse to threaten Musk with an investigation.</p><blockquote>Due to Twitter‚Äôs lax verification practices and apparent need for cash, anyone could pay $8.00 and impersonate someone on your platform. Selling the truth is dangerous and unacceptable. Twitter must explain how this happened and how it will prevent it from happening again.</blockquote><p>Elon Musk responded by... being Elon Musk. "Perhaps it is because your real account sounds like a parody? And why does your [profile picture] have a mask!?"</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">And why does your pp have a mask!?<br />‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1591817319143313408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <a href="https://t.co/oNmqc7NlxY">pic.twitter.com/oNmqc7NlxY</a><br />‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1591903125878996992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Elon wins the Twitter beef... for now. Though I don't think we make it to the spring without Musk being dragged before a Senate committee. Another round of Senators performing in front of Big Tech CEOs sounds tiresome. In this case, I think Elon would make things entertaining.<br /></p><p>And at this point in the Twitter debacle, it's all about our entertainment.</p><p><p>
