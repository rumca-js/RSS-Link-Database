Four hundred and you\u2019d get a denim jacket. But in the commercial accompanying the launch, Pepsi went further, joking that anyone who collected 7m labels would be eligible for a brand new Harrier jump jet. The mistake? Pepsi forgot to add any small print pointing out that it was a joke.</p><p>That one oversight now forms the basis for a wildly entertaining Netflix series, entitled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/11/tulsa-king-to-pepsi-wheres-my-jet-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week\">Pepsi, Where\u2019s My Jet?</a> It tells the story of John Leonard, a Washington State community college student who decided to take Pepsi at its word. After quickly realising that buying 7m cans or bottles of Pepsi would be prohibitively expensive, Leonard saw a disclaimer revealing that, rather than collecting labels, consumers could buy Pepsi Points for 10 cents each. A $23m Harrier jump jet for just $700,000? That was the bargain of the century.

The veteran point guard and the stumbling Lakers offer a textbook example</p><p>Long before I was ever anything close to what could be considered an expert on the NBA, I was something of an expert on relationships. I\u2019ve always found human interaction fascinating (and that was even before the years of therapy). Relatedly, one of the many basketball hills I\u2019m prone to die on is that it\u2019s a relationships business. Chemistry, camaraderie and general good vibes are not only important to team success; they\u2019re <em>everything</em>. So, needless to say, living in Los Angeles the last few years has made for intriguing proximity to one of the most interesting case studies on fractured relationships in the league: that between Russell Westbrook and the Los Angeles Lakers.</p><p>The present-day Lakers are, to put it in plain English, a mess. Placing the blame for that squarely on the shoulders of the mercurial Westbrook is woefully reductive, and certainly doesn\u2019t tell the full story. For starters, Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka just got a contract extension, which is somewhat puzzling given his less-than-stellar success rate in the years since the team\u2019s 2020 championship (though some have argued that LeBron James\u2019 opinion on the roster weighed heavily in decision making as well). Even dating back to a time before James signed with the Lakers in the summer of 2018, the industry has kibitzed about the front office\u2019s apparent ineptitude. But Westbrook\u2019s $47m salary has certainly encumbered the team and limited any functional ability to build around its top-tier superstars in James and Anthony Davis. To put the $47m in perspective: it\u2019s almost $3m more than James himself will make this season, and, staggeringly, more than everyone else on the team outside James and Davis makes <em>combined</em>. Directly or indirectly, Westbrook finds himself at the crux of the issue.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/16/russell-westbrook-la-lakers-problems-relationships\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/16/which-player-has-been-to-most-major-football-tournaments-without-playing-knowledge", "title": "Which footballer has been to most major tournaments without playing? | The Knowledge", "date_published": "2022-11-16 08:00:14+00:00", "description": "<p>Plus: the lowest-ranked World Cup opening game; more managers replacing their successors; and errors in World Cups</p><ul><li><a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\">Mail us</a> your questions or tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theknowledge_gu\">@TheKnowledge_GU</a></li></ul><p><strong>\u201cMartin Keown went to the World Cup in 1998 and 2002 but didn\u2019t play a minute.

But at the high-profile shows this season, it was all about the flat stomach</p><p>Sometimes fashion is about clothes, but sometimes it is really about bodies. The Council of Fashion Designers of America awards are the highest honours awarded to US fashion designers, so you would expect the star-studded New York gala to be a showcase for extraordinary clothes. But last week the red carpet was won not by a dress, but by a body. Uncut Gems actor Julia Fox wore a cutout dress that was mostly cutout, with a side order of dress. Baring Fox from her breastbone to her thighs, it revealed a black bikini and highlighted a carved-out, rock-hard midsection, visible ribs and sinewy glutes. Her slender body, not the dress, was the outfit.</p><p>The standout trend at this season\u2019s catwalk shows was the flat stomach. At Fendi, ribs were visible under tissue-thin knitwear tucked into cargo pants that hung below the models\u2019 hipbones. At Versace there was a long plane of taut bare flesh between the bumster-style waistband on a pair of jeans and the tiny bra top. Second-skin catsuits came in black lace at Burberry and crystal mesh at Stella McCartney. All of these were worn on the catwalk by models with the low body fat necessary for bones, cavities and ridges of muscle to be clearly visible.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/nov/16/it-feels-like-the-progress-is-getting-reversed-how-fashion-fell-out-of-love-with-curves\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/16/life-halts-when-a-storm-hits-how-a-climate-threat-affects-cairo-and-dubai", "title": "\u2018Life halts when a storm hits\u2019: how a climate threat affects Cairo and Dubai", "date_published": "2022-11-16 06:00:14+00:00", "description": "<p>Stark difference in experience of sandstorms in two cities raises questions as climate crisis deepens</p><ul><li>This is one of a short series of pieces \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/between-two-worlds\">Between two worlds</a> \u2013 reflecting on ways climate breakdown will affect different parts of the world</li></ul><p>As a young girl, I used to check the weather by looking out of my fifth-floor flat window.
