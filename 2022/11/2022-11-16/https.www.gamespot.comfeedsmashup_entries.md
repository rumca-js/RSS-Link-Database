<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2022/11/cailee-spaeny-alien-movie-20th-century-scott-free-1235174184/">Deadline</a> is reporting that Cailee Spaeny is in talks to star in 20th Century's new Alien movie, with Fede Alvarez (Don't Breathe) directing and Ridley Scott's Scott Free producing. Their sources aren't saying much more about the production, and 20th Century had no comment.</p><p>Alvarez's pitch apparently impressed both 20th Century and Scott Free so they made this a top priority and an attempt is being made to get this production going and starting early next year. A recent script was delivered and the momentum has really started to pick up.</p><p>This would be the seventh Alien movie, not counting the Aliens vs Predator spin-offs. It's unclear of Spaeney's role so far but she's no stranger to sci-fi having been in Pacific Rim: Uprising and starring in FX's Devs, where she played a character that presents as male.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-alien-movie-looks-to-add-devs-star-to-cast-report/1100-6509227/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Note that these carry the Sony logo, not the PlayStation logo, and they're arguably a better fit for PC than PS5 (since you'll gain access to the 360 Spatial Sound to customize your listening experience). That being said, you'll get a lot of cool features regardless of what platform you hook these up to, including Tempest 3D audio support on PS5. Here’s a closer look at all three to help you determine if one is a good fit for your gaming needs.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sony Inzone H7 Wireless Gaming Headset</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4056446-h7.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>$148 ($<del>230</del>)</strong></p><p>Discounted by $82, this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the Inzone H7 headset since launch. And considering it’s manufactured by Sony and optimized for both PS5 and PC, that’s reason alone to check it out. You’ll also be treated to a premium design that takes strong cues from the new-gen console, up to 40 hours of runtime on a single charge, and a convenient, wireless connection that works via a USB dongle and Bluetooth. There’s also a Discord-certified microphone that makes it easy to communicate with your teammates.

<p>Pentiment director Josh Sawyer has said that it is likely that Pentiment would not exist without Xbox Game Pass.</p><p>On November 15's episode of <a href="https://play.acast.com/s/vicegamingsnewpodcast/episode-523-the-year-of-the-narrative-banger-continues-with-">Waypoint Radio</a>, as spotted by Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/BenjiSales/status/1592930231870197762">BenjiSales</a>, Sawyer said that the content of his new game is too niche for most traditional publishers to pick it up. Sawyer said, "Xbox knew the project existed in a vague sense, but we didn't show anything to them until after our virtual slice...then we had already executed on the core idea and [Microsoft] was very supportive." Game Pass, as well as Microsoft's official ownership of Obsidian, gives the studio flexibility to pursue smaller projects.</p><p>While his experience has been positive, Sawyer did say that "it's totally reasonable to look at it and say there's a tradeoff for both developers and potentially for the people using it." The statement lines up with what he has said in the past, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/why-pentiment-is-fallout-new-vegas-designers-dream-project/2300-6458616/">in a prior interview with GameSpot</a>.

<p>Ubisoft and Riot Games are launching Zero Harm in Comms, a research project focused on AI-based solutions to toxicity during player interactions in multiplayer games.</p><p>The program aims to expand the abilities of their AI tech to halt hostile, bigoted, or negative interactions between players. It will attempt to build a cross-industry database and labeling system, which will then be used to train AI moderation tools to preemptively find and stop bad behavior. This player data will be anonymized, according to Ubisoft's press release, as part of the program effort to ensure privacy and conduct this research ethically.</p><p>The project is the brain child of Yves Jacquier, the executive director of Ubisoft La Forge, and Wesley Kerr, head of technology research at Riot. Jacquier said in a press release that, "We believe that, by coming together as an industry, we will be able to tackle this issue more effectively.” Kerr emphasized the project's potential to affect spaces outside of games saying, “Disruptive behavior isn’t a problem that is unique to games -- every company that has an online social platform is working to address this challenging space."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-and-riot-have-teamed-up-to-create-industry-wide-tools-for-preventing-player-toxicity/1100-6509219/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Improving closeness in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/harvestella/">Harvestella </a>is key not just to unlocking new jobs for your character, but for unlocking the hearts of your friends and neighbors. Maxing out closeness creates an opportunity to establish romance and then a life partnership - Harvestella's take on marriage - with a handful of Harvestella’s characters, though the farm-RPG isn’t too keen on telling you how to actually make it happen.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How closeness and romance work in Harvestella</h2><p dir="ltr">Harvestella has eight characters you can potentially strike up a romantic relationship and, later a partnership with.

Establishing a partnership unlocks new dialogue options, but you can’t have children and, as far as we can tell, can’t have multiple partners.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harvestella-closeness-and-romance-explained/1100-6509191/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4064035-untitled-8.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Believe it or not, Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has come and gone. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, much of the phase was jam packed between two years, with nothing being released in 2020. However, between the start of Phase 4--WandaVision--and the end of it--Black Panther: Wakanda Forever--there have been 16 movies and TV shows taking place in the MCU to be released.</p><p dir="ltr">Phase 4 had a lot to live up to. It's coming off of the heels of Avengers: Endgame, which changed the MCU forever--it also killed off a few characters to boot. It's essentially a brand-new starting point, as there's few-to-no loose ends to tie up, but a whole lot to set up for the future. We know what's coming in Phase 5 and Phase 6, so this current run of movies and TV shows will undoubtedly be important.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking back at all Phase 4, we're taking a look at how critics rated each TV show and movie from the past couple of years. Using GameSpot's sister site Metacritic--a review aggregator--we're ranking all 16 pieces of media from Phase 4. Check them out below.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>16. Eternals (2021)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4064036-1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Metacritic score: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/eternals">52</a></p><p dir="ltr">A large-scale cinematic experience, Eternals follows a group of superpowered beings that come from space but have been on Earth since humans have existed. Of course, there's some nasty monsters they need to fight before humanity as a whole is destroyed.</p><p>"There is plenty of forward momentum to be found here and Marvel's willingness to deviate from its own formulas is a hopeful trend that Phase 4 continues to double down on," said Mason Downey in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-eternals-review-a-gorgeous-experiment/1900-6417768/">Eternals review</a>. "With any luck, these characters will continue to grow and evolve as they return in future movies and the techniques Zhao was able to include as a director won't be one-offs."</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>15. Thor: Love and Thunder (2022)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4064037-2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Metacritic score: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/thor-love-and-thunder">57</a></p><p dir="ltr">The fourth Thor movie sees Taikia Waititi return as director. Thor needs to get his life back in order as there's a being traveling throughout the universe killing gods. Thor isn't the only god of thunder this time around as a dying Jane Foster has also gained Thor powers as well.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/thor-love-and-thunder-review-style-over-substance/1900-6417908/">Thor: Love and Thunder review</a>, Mason Downey said, "The end result of these non sequiturs and disparate ideas makes Love and Thunder feel less like a movie and more like a scrapbook of random ideas, cut up in between some neat looking music videos."</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>14. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4064038-3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Metacritic score: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness">60</a></p><p dir="ltr">The Doctor Strange sequel is the closest thing we've seen to a Marvel horror movie to date, with Sam Raimi helming this one. Strange joins forces with America Chavez, a young woman who can travel between universes, as the duo take on a very familiar threat. Tonally, it's one of the most ambitious films of this phase of the MCU.</p><p dir="ltr">"All told, despite the unevenness in the presentation, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a fun, fresh take for the MCU and, with any luck, a hopeful indication of things to come in the future," said Mason Downey in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-review-dimension-hopping-horrors/1900-6417872/">Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness review</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>13. Hawkeye (2021)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4064039-4.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Jeremy Renner returns as the famed MCU archer as he's on the hunt for someone who's running around in his Ronin outfit. From there, he trains a new archer as the two are on the run from bad guys in tracksuits--yes, much like Matt Fraction and David Aja's Hawkeye comic book run.</p><p>Mason Downey found the show to be a bit of a mixed bag, missed the mark of the source material in a few ways, and found Renner to be "wooden" in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hawkeye-review-marvels-latest-misses-the-mark/1900-6417795/">Hawkeye review</a> on GameSpot.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>12. She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4064040-5.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Metacritic score: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/she-hulk-attorney-at-law">67</a></p><p dir="ltr">One of the more refreshing Marvel series of this past year was She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, as the show was a workplace comedy, and less of the "superhero smashing the bad guy" type show. It was certainly out there, with the finals episodes having She-Hulk really breaking the fourth wall harder than we've ever seen in a Marvel movie or TV show.</p><p dir="ltr">Chris E. Hayner said in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/she-hulk-attorney-at-law-review-hulk-smashes-the-typical-workplace-comedy/1900-6417940/">She-Hulk review</a> that "It's those elements that make She-Hulk: Attorney At Law a can't-miss entry into Disney+'s MCU lineup. Of course, it also provides a nice vacation from the typical Marvel fare."</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. Black Widow (2021)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4064041-6.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Metacritic score: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/black-widow">67</a></p><p dir="ltr">Taking place prior to Endgame, for very obvious reasons, Black Widow expanded on the mythos of who and what Black Widow is. We're introduced to the next generation of Widow--Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova--and get a few more cool characters before Natasha disappears for good. Sadly, this movie was pushed back multiple times because of the COVID-19 pandemic, so by the time it came out, it had been a year removed from its original release date.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/black-widow-review-awkward-timing/1900-6417695/">Black Widow review</a>, Mike Rougeau said, "Fans hungry for any MCU entry at all will find plenty to chew on in Black Widow, but ultimately the movie is unsatisfying. That may be partially down to real-world issues that are outside of anyone's control, like the pandemic pushing release dates around. But despite strong performances from the leads and the addition of a couple of welcome new characters who may spice up the MCU's future, this Natasha side story has plenty of inherent problems that drag it down regardless of any external factors."</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4064042-7.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Metacritic score: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/black-panther-wakanda-forever">67</a></p><p dir="ltr">Even without the first film's star Chadwick Boseman, the Black Panther sequel had the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-panther-wakanda-forever-has-biggest-november-opening-in-us-history/1100-6509113/">biggest November opening weekend in US history</a>. The followup deals with the loss of T'Challa all while trying to move forward as Wakanda steps into the world's spotlight. However, Namor and his people--who also live in secret--have a major conflict with Wakanda, and it's an all out war.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/black-panther-wakanda-forever-review-long-live-the-king/1900-6417996/">Black Panther: Wakanda Forever review</a>, Mason Downey said that the movie itself is good, but it tries to be too many things all at the same time, which dulls everything else contained in the film.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Werewolf by Night (2022)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4064043-8.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Metacritic score: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/werewolf-by-night">69</a></p><p dir="ltr">A stylized special, Werewolf By Night follows a group of monster hunters that are in a competition to find a powerful artifact. And of course, there are some monsters lurking about. This is the first Marvel stand-alone special, with Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special coming soon.</p><p dir="ltr">In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/werewolf-by-night-review-marvel-studios-spooky-special-presentation-shows-the-mcu-has-range/1900-6417974/">Werewolf by Night review</a>, Chris E. Hayner said, "Werewolf By Night is an astounding success. It may not overtly connect to the MCU in a way that makes it essential viewing for fans of the franchise, but much like She-Hulk, it's the kind of side quest adventure that Marvel Studios needs more of."</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. What If…?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4064044-9.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Metacritic score: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-what-if">69</a></p><p dir="ltr">The Disney+ series takes place in the multiverse, following various heroes and villains--some that are familiar to the average MCU fan, but with a twist. This also includes the introduction of the beloved Marvel property, Marvel Zombies. Hopefully, we'll see more of them in Season 2.</p><p dir="ltr">"[What If…?] will encourage fans to start actually pondering the titular question in their own ways, which can be a blast all on its own," said Mason Downey in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-what-if-review-plenty-of-potential/1900-6417710/">review</a>.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Moon Knight (2022)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4064045-10.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Metacritic score: <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/moon-knight">69</a></p><p dir="ltr">Moon Knight has always been an interesting character.

<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has commented on the company's plans for an Xbox game-streaming device--codenamed Keystone--saying the team <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-plan-to-let-you-play-xbox-without-xbox-moves-ahead-at-xbox/1100-6503931/">decided to rework the unit this past May</a> because it was proving to be too expensive. This Keystone device was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-streaming-console-prototype-spotted-on-phil-spencers-shelf/1100-6508164/">spotted on Spencer's shelf</a>, sparking new discussion about it. </p><p>Speaking on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel">The Verge's Decoder podcast</a>, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-boss-wants-to-hit-99-129-price-point-for-its-game-streaming-device/">as transcribed by VGC</a>, Spencer said Microsoft opted to focus more on building the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-now-stream-xbox-games-from-a-new-samsung-tv-no-console-required/1100-6505013/">Samsung smart TV Xbox app</a> and shift away from the Keystone device for the time being due to costs coming in higher than it wanted.</p><p>With the Series S starting at $300, Spencer said the delta between the S and the streaming device would need to be "pretty significant" for it to make commercial sense. Spencer said the Keystone device, whenever it's released, needs to be between $100-$130. Spencer's desire to include a controller in the box made it difficult to hit that price point.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-why-the-xbox-streaming-console-isnt-ready-yet/1100-6509207/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>David Zaslav, CEO and president of the newly-merged Warner Bros. Discovery has said that HBO lost $3 billion last year, failing to earn back a huge amount of money spent on content, <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/11/dc-david-zaslav-warner-bros-discovery-hbo-max-1235172584/">Deadline reports</a>. The comment comes after cost-cutting measures saw a huge amount of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/26-hbo-max-original-shows-and-movies-pulled-from-the-service/2900-4288/">original content pulled from HBO Max</a>, with the biggest losses coming from the animation department.</p><p>In a keynote presentation at the RBC Media conference, Zaslav touched on a number of the difficulties that have come with the Warner Bros. Discovery merger, including a need to rethink streaming models. "Right now, we can get 30 million people with Euphoria, but they can come on for two months, watch Euphoria and then leave," Zaslav explained. "Do we want to create incentives for people to be there? There are a lot of companies that have a business where the majority of people are there for the year."</p><p>Concerning HBO's finances, he said "I don’t know if I’ve ever seen anything like that," explaining that HBO spent $2.5 billion in 2019 for a profit of $2.5 billion, while in 2021 it spent a whopping $7 billion, which then saw a $3 billion loss. While discussing the loss, Zaslav pointed out "all those direct to streaming movies just thrown right on top" of HBO Max.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbo-lost-3-billion-dollars-in-2021/1100-6509195/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
