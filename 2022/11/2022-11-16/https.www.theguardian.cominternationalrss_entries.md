<p>It’s more than 40 years since UK inflation was so high. Voters will not forget, nor will they likely forgive, come the next election</p><p>In no way can Jeremy Hunt’s autumn financial statement on Thursday be treated as a budget like any other. The economic stakes for the country and the political stakes for the Conservative government after the Liz Truss debacle are simply too high and too serious for that. Today, though, the stakes ratcheted up a notch, when the UK inflation rate rose unexpectedly steeply in the year to October to<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/16/uk-inflation-rate-energy-price-rises"> reach 11.1%</a>.</p><p>This is a big moment, resonant with grimmer 20th-century times. It comes in part as the latest in a series of severe economic shocks, following Brexit, Covid and the energy crisis, that appear to be driving Britain into a longer and deeper recession than its neighbours, and which are not yet over. But the inflation spike is also an event of which millions of voters, with mortgages, overdrafts and needs that they cannot cover, have no recent experience.</p><p>Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/16/forget-budget-scars-inflation-uk-voters-election">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The man who turned bebop upside down with Ornette Coleman went on to work with artists from Sonny Rollins to Ian Dury – and the London jazz festival is set to show he’s still inspiring</p><p>Nineteen fifty-nine was a pivotal year in jazz. In August, trumpeter Miles Davis released his landmark album Kind of Blue, which would go on to become the best-selling jazz record of all time thanks to its accessible blend of blues and modal voicings. But in November, self-taught tenor saxophonist Ornette Coleman blew Davis’s mainstream style wide open during a two-week residency at New York’s Five Spot Cafe. Coleman and his quartet premiered an entirely different, avant-garde sound that was lauded by critics but deeply controversial among audiences. Disregarding conventional chord structures in favour of an anarchic, unpredictable and often atonal improvisation, he birthed a new concept: free jazz.</p><p>Flanking Coleman on stage was 23-year-old Oklahoman trumpeter Don Cherry. Blending the saxophonist’s melodies and frenetic lines with his own self-assured, bright phrasings, Cherry was Coleman’s harmonic partner amid the cacophony. Using a compact pocket trumpet with a bell that sat closer to his mouth, as if he was singing when he played, he was the open ear capable of turning a monologue without form into a dialogue of its own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/16/the-baddest-technician-how-don-cherry-is-still-making-jazz-new">Continue reading...</a>

## Unexpected nudity and vomit-covered cats: how Dwarf Fortress tells some of gaming’s most bizarre stories

<p>For around 20 years, brothers Zach and Tarn Adams have been working on their idiosyncratic fantasy game – and it’s only just got graphics</p><p>In 2015, players of the video game Dwarf Fortress – a wildly influential cult hit that has appeared at New York’s Museum of Modern Art, and been cited as the inspiration for Minecraft – started finding vomit-covered dead cats in taverns. When the game’s creator, 44-year-old Tarn Adams, attempted to determine the cause, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAhHkJQ3KgY&amp;ab_channel=Noclip-VideoGameDocumentaries">he discovered</a> that cats were walking through puddles of spilled alcohol, licking themselves clean, and promptly dying of heart failure due to a minor error in the game’s code, which overestimated the amount of alcohol ingested.</p><p>Most games don’t simulate anything nearly as complex as alcohol poisoning and feline grooming, but Dwarf Fortress does, and the way that its code generates these bizarre situations is symbolic of what people love about it. Dwarf Fortress has a unique, incredibly complicated approach to storytelling and play, but it looks like pure Matrix code, composed entirely of coloured text. Any casual observer would find it indecipherable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/nov/16/unexpected-nudity-and-vomit-covered-cats-how-dwarf-fortress-tells-some-of-gamings-most-bizarre-stories">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Novels by Richard Powers and Colson Whitehead, and polemics by Rachel Carson and Mary Wollstonecraft show how ideas and words can change the world</p><p>Revolutions are often associated with great upheavals and bloodshed – accompanied by metaphors of eruptions and earthquakes. Revolutionaries are often portrayed as heroic figures – strong and invincible – but the reality is often very different. Revolutionaries such as Thomas Jefferson, for example, wielded pens rather than swords. I’ve always been fascinated by the men and women who used ideas and words to fight their battles. Or those who quietly rose against their oppressors, undermining and outsmarting them with their minds, philosophy, covert operations, wit and non–violent resistance.</p><p>My book <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/magnificent-rebels-9781529392746?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">Magnificent Rebels: The First Romantics and the Invention of the Self</a> tells the story of a group of brilliant poets, thinkers and philosophers who came together in the small German university town Jena in the last decade of the 18th century and changed the way we think about ourselves, the world and nature. At a time when most of Europe was held in the iron fist of absolutism, they put the self at centre stage and imbued it with the most thrilling of all powers: free will and self–determination. They did so by giving rousing lectures and writing books, pamphlets, articles and poems – and with pens as sharp as the French guillotines. “A word of command set armies in motion,” the poet Novalis wrote, it was “the word freedom.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/16/top-10-books-about-unlikely-revolutionaries-andrea-wulf-magnificent-rebels">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Plenty of games have found real-world success through viral fame on the platform.

But the chaos that has enveloped the funniest and most infuriating social media platform of them all is also causing consternation for game artists, developers and marketers, many of whom view it as integral to their careers. Very Online millennials make up a huge proportion of the video game workforce, and plenty of us have been networking and snarking on Twitter for our entire careers. If the platform either goes away or changes beyond recognition, it will effect the games industry and how it socialises.</p><p>Plenty of games have found real-world success through viral Twitter fame. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/sep/27/pushing-buttons-trombone-champ-rhythm-games">Trombone Champ</a> is only the latest example, elevated from the crowded field of weekly Steam releases with a tweet shared by PC Gamer. Untitled Goose Game – the beloved comedy game about a foul fowl – also picked up a huge audience there. And Cult of the Lamb is another recent game that owes at least some of its success to developers and fans’ clever use of Twitter: it’s the modern version of word-of-mouth. I have discovered countless games from seeing interesting clips on Twitter. It’s where I first saw the Bafta-winning Unpacking. It’s also where many journalists, streamers and publisher talent scouts hear about forthcoming games, and where players go to find out what’s generating buzz.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/nov/16/if-twitter-breaks-down-the-games-industry-wont-ever-be-the-same">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Beethoven to bebop to his own abrasive, atonal ‘noise band’, the now revered artist tuned his work to music at every turn of his career, as a major new show reveals</p><p>Walking through the gallery, it’s the loudness of the paintings that hits you. A work from 1982, Anybody Speaking Words, is in screaming yellow and black, with a tonsil-filled mouth singing the word “OPERA, OPERA, OPERA” while the performer’s body vibrates with lines, squiggles and curlicues. King Zulu [pictured above] is a field of loud sky-blue populated with the figures of legendary jazz artists: Louis Armstrong clutching his trumpet, Charlie Parker on saxophone, an all-star band for all time. Not far away, you encounter Armstrong and Parker again, in a collage called Plastic Sax from 1984. In the corner of the frame, there’s scribbled a single explosive word surrounded by cartoonish clouds: “KABOOM”</p><p>In the 34 years since his death at 27, there have been almost as many attempts to unpick the complex, multifaceted work of Jean-Michel Basquiat as there have been exhibitions and news stories featuring him. In his own time, he was applauded for bringing the scrappy, manic energy of street art to the mainstream art world (too scrappy for many museums, who turned down offers to acquire his paintings and must now be kicking themselves).

<p>Fiennes plays a culinary wizard to the super-rich who’s grown sick of his vain and greedy clientele</p><p>Foodie films come in two flavours: joyous life-affirming celebrations of family, community and sharing (Babette’s Feast, Big Night) or horrifying denunciations of consumerism and despair (La Grande Bouffe, The Meaning of Life). This horror comedy about a hyper-exclusive restaurant which must be visited on its own island comes from screenwriters Seth Reiss and Will Tracy and director Mark Mylod, and it is very much in the latter category. Its chapter-heading intertitles are the menu items as the meal progresses and they become increasingly alarming.</p><p>The Menu has something in common with that recent much-praised award winner Triangle of Sadness, about plutocrats gorging themselves on a luxury cruise ship; in both, a humble burger is presented in contrast to the culpable fine dining. But The Menu is more controlled and more interesting, with one or two actual laughs – though I have to admit as always to being impatient with the expectation that at some level, and whatever the satirical context, we are supposed to swoon at all these connoisseur gourmand details.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/16/the-menu-review-ralph-fiennes-celeb-chef-horror-comedy-cooks-nasty-surprises">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The constraining and consoling effects of music are compellingly explored in this novel about a bereaved pianist</p><p>Early in The Ghost Variations, the third novel by Damian Lanigan, the narrator approaches a woman in a bar to ask her a question: “Would you mind if I played the piano a little? I’ll be quiet. And I’ll be good. I’ll be quietly good.”</p><p>Quietly good: the phrase aptly describes this accomplished book about love, grief and the constraining and consoling effects of art. Declan Byrnie grew up in a family with Irish roots in working-class Manchester, but his prodigious gifts as a classical pianist transported him to a lavish world of concert halls and oligarchs’ homes. He was at the height of his fame when his wife, Esther, died in mysterious circumstances during a hiking trip; bereft, he disappeared from the music scene for four years. We meet Byrnie as he prepares for what, having been coaxed by his agent to perform again before adoring audiences and a prurient media, he sardonically calls the “Dead Wife Tour”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/16/the-ghost-variations-by-damian-lanigan-review-the-power-of-the-piano">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When the cola brand launched a points-for-prizes scheme in the 90s, John Leonard spotted a loophole and fought for what he saw as rightly his: a Harrier jump jet. A new documentary tells the wild story</p><p>In 1996, PepsiCo – then known for creating the young, cool, carbonated drink of a generation – made an incredible mistake. The company had just launched its Pepsi Points scheme, in which customers could save Pepsi labels and redeem them against Pepsi-branded merchandise. Sixty tokens would get you a hat. Four hundred and you’d get a denim jacket. But in the commercial accompanying the launch, Pepsi went further, joking that anyone who collected 7m labels would be eligible for a brand new Harrier jump jet. The mistake? Pepsi forgot to add any small print pointing out that it was a joke.</p><p>That one oversight now forms the basis for a wildly entertaining Netflix series, entitled <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/11/tulsa-king-to-pepsi-wheres-my-jet-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week">Pepsi, Where’s My Jet?</a> It tells the story of John Leonard, a Washington State community college student who decided to take Pepsi at its word. After quickly realising that buying 7m cans or bottles of Pepsi would be prohibitively expensive, Leonard saw a disclaimer revealing that, rather than collecting labels, consumers could buy Pepsi Points for 10 cents each. A $23m Harrier jump jet for just $700,000? That was the bargain of the century. Over four episodes, the show recounts one young man’s determination to take on a multinational corporation to get what an advert had promised him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/16/pepsi-wheres-my-jet-netflix-documentary-student-who-sued-pepsi-for-jump-jet">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A Nigerian refugee held in a Dublin detention centre develops an emotional connection with an Irish security guard, played by Josh O’Connor</p><p></p><p>This intense and heartfelt drama from Irish writer-director Frank Berry addresses a growing concern in Ireland: that a nation once known for its talented and hard-working emigrants is becoming ironically heartless towards its own applicants for asylum (although Ireland hasn’t yet embraced Theresa May’s “hostile environment” formula).</p><p>Letitia Wright gives a performance of intense focus, controlled anger and dignity as Aisha, a Nigerian refugee being held in a Dublin detention centre, unable to return because her father and brothers were murdered by gangsters; she is trying to establish her own leave to remain and then bring over her elderly, ailing mother who is still in danger. Aisha is treated like a cross between a prisoner and a difficult boarding school pupil by the prickly official staff with whom she is icily resentful in return. But she finds a miraculous connection with a new security guard there: Conor, a guy with vulnerabilities of his own – and it’s a lovely, gentle performance from Josh O’Connor with whom Wright finds a very emotional rapport.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/16/aisha-review-letitia-wright-shines-in-heartfelt-asylum-seeker-drama-josh-o-connor">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The sitcom star’s fascinating, gruesome tale of addiction and how he kept the show on the road</p><p><br />When Matthew Perry was taking his first steps as an actor, his father bought him a book called Acting With Style. John Bennett Perry, a singer and performer best known for appearing in Old Spice adverts in the 1970s and 80s, wrote in the inside page: “Another generation shot to hell. Love, Dad.” Little did he know how accurate his inscription would turn out to be. Professionally, his son would easily outshine him, landing the part of Chandler Bing in Friends, the biggest sitcom in TV history. But, in life, it was Matthew who came off worse, a result of his catastrophic addictions to alcohol and opiates.</p><p>By turns fascinating and maddening, Perry’s memoir is less a tale of a glittering showbiz career than a fitfully gruesome account of his efforts to keep the show on the road. He reckons to have attended 6,000 AA meetings, detoxed 65 times, and spent in the region of $7m to get sober. His book begins, as so many addiction memoirs do, with him at his lowest ebb. Hospitalised after an “explosion” of the bowel, a result of chronic constipation caused by opiate abuse, he had arrived at the emergency room screaming in pain and then fallen into a coma which lasted for 14 days. “It’s kind of poetic,” he notes. “I was so full of shit it nearly killed me.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/16/friends-lovers-and-the-big-terrible-thing-by-matthew-perry-review-being-chandler-bing">Continue reading...</a>

## No relationship is worth misery. Russell Westbrook and the Lakers is no different

<p>Staying in relationships after they’re healthy is never a good idea. The veteran point guard and the stumbling Lakers offer a textbook example</p><p>Long before I was ever anything close to what could be considered an expert on the NBA, I was something of an expert on relationships. I’ve always found human interaction fascinating (and that was even before the years of therapy). Relatedly, one of the many basketball hills I’m prone to die on is that it’s a relationships business. Chemistry, camaraderie and general good vibes are not only important to team success; they’re <em>everything</em>. So, needless to say, living in Los Angeles the last few years has made for intriguing proximity to one of the most interesting case studies on fractured relationships in the league: that between Russell Westbrook and the Los Angeles Lakers.</p><p>The present-day Lakers are, to put it in plain English, a mess. Placing the blame for that squarely on the shoulders of the mercurial Westbrook is woefully reductive, and certainly doesn’t tell the full story. For starters, Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka just got a contract extension, which is somewhat puzzling given his less-than-stellar success rate in the years since the team’s 2020 championship (though some have argued that LeBron James’ opinion on the roster weighed heavily in decision making as well). Even dating back to a time before James signed with the Lakers in the summer of 2018, the industry has kibitzed about the front office’s apparent ineptitude. But Westbrook’s $47m salary has certainly encumbered the team and limited any functional ability to build around its top-tier superstars in James and Anthony Davis. To put the $47m in perspective: it’s almost $3m more than James himself will make this season, and, staggeringly, more than everyone else on the team outside James and Davis makes <em>combined</em>. Directly or indirectly, Westbrook finds himself at the crux of the issue.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/16/russell-westbrook-la-lakers-problems-relationships">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The rightwing views young people as a threat – and that is not just in the US</p><p>Gen Z certainly brought their A-game to the US midterms last week. Predictions of a “red wave” were thwarted, thanks largely to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/14/gen-z-voters-midterms-democrats">young people</a> turning up in huge numbers to vote for Democrats. Young women in particular: 72% of women aged 18-29 voted for <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3731564-young-women-broke-hard-for-democrats-in-the-midterms/">Democrat candidates according to exit polls</a>. Not hard to figure out why, is it? Do we vote for the forced-birthers or do we vote for the people who might give us a few rights over our own bodies? Hmmm. Still, that question seems to have stumped other demographics: Democrats lost voters aged 45 and older by at least seven points, including a 12-point loss <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/12/politics/young-voters-democrats-midterm-elections/index.html">among people over 65</a>.</p><p>The fact that young people don’t like them very much hasn’t bypassed the Republican party. Instead of rethinking their policies, however, some of them have decided to rethink the voting age. Over the last few days, a lot of Republicans have been proclaiming that the US ought to increase the <a href="https://twitter.com/ACTBrigitte/status/1590404126428434433">legal voting age to 21</a>. (One conservative radio personality even suggested it be <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/some-republicans-want-to-raise-voting-age-after-gen-zs-strong-midterm-turnout">raised to 28</a>.) The same people who reckon a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/16/rightwing-rape-abortion-10-year-old-worse">10-year-old girl</a> is mature enough to be forced to carry a baby, reckon a 20-year-old isn’t mature enough to vote.</p><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/16/gen-z-helped-to-stop-the-red-wave-in-the-midterms-the-republicans-response-try-to-raise-the-voting-age">Continue reading...</a>

## LA Seduction review – remake of 60s cult flick dials up the misogyny

<p>The original at least reflected its era but this updated story of a woman targeted for sexual assault by a couple of drifters is a nasty pulpy mess</p><p>This leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth. It’s a remake of the psychosexual home invasion thriller <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/27/private-property-review-warren-oates-leslie-stevens">Private Property</a>, which starred Warren Oates – a cult classic that was out of circulation for decades after its release in 1960. (Memorably, Jackie Kennedy described it as an “awful, sordid thing”.) Depressingly, the new version seems to preserve its deeply misogynistic 1960s attitudes towards women. It’s a nasty pulpy film, in which the big question for the plot is whether a young woman is going be violently sexually assaulted and murdered at the end. Will-she-or-won’t-she? It’s a grim watch.</p><p>That woman is Kathryn (a woodenly pouty performance by Ashley Benson). She’s an aspiring actor married to a successful movie producer. While he’s at work, Kathryn spends her days cleaning their fancy home in the Hollywood Hills while wearing super-tight denim shorts. Then one day a new gardener replaces her usual guy. This is Duke (Shiloh Fernandez), who charms Kathryn by fixing stuff around the house. “I’m good at most physical stuff,” he says, wink wink. We are supposed to buy Duke’s seduction, but the sexual tension is Baltic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/16/la-seduction-review-remake-of-60s-cult-flick-dials-up-the-misogyny">Continue reading...</a>

## A game of two halves: how ‘sportswashing’ benefits Qatar and the west | David Wearing

<p>The World Cup is designed to showcase a regime heading in the right direction. And that safeguards existing power relations</p><p>Ever since it won the right to host the 2022 World Cup, Qatar has been the subject of sustained critical scrutiny. A spotlight has been shone on the Gulf emirate’s repression of <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/03/29/qatar-male-guardianship-severely-curtails-womens-rights">women</a> and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/10/24/qatar-security-forces-arrest-abuse-lgbt-people">LGBTQ</a> people, and its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/sep/20/workers-qatar-world-cup-football-stadiums-toil-in-debt-and-squalor">punishing exploitation</a> of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers. But the picture is incomplete. The fact is that the roots of Qatari repression extend well beyond Qatar, connecting the emirate to the supposedly liberal states of the west.</p><p>Much of the discourse around the World Cup has carried the implication that abuses in Qatar are an outgrowth of a local <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/26/uk-minister-criticised-over-call-for-gay-world-cup-fans-to-show-respect-in-qatar">conservative “culture”</a>, as juxtaposed with more enlightened “western values”. In fact, the persistence of monarchical rule in the Gulf is the result of more than a century of collusion between local elites and the west. If we are serious in our objections to the abuses found in Qatar, then we need to consider how Qatari authoritarianism sits within a much wider system of power, violence and exploitation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/16/sportswashing-qatar-west-world-cup-regime">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I thought I was going for a routine therapy session. But Wendell had other ideas</p><p>In July 2007, I visited a shaman by accident. My wife had an appointment with a therapist called Wendell and, unable to attend, she offered it to me. As I ascended the stairs in Notting Hill, I mused on the fact that I had once worked as a film editor at a company on Wendell Road in Shepherd’s Bush. I hadn’t thought about that job for years; it was before I became a father, a comedy writer, a musician and a voice artist – and developed the calm exterior that belied my turbulent, contradictory internal state. It had been 22 years but being cast back to that time made me shudder, as though a wave was passing through me.</p><p>As I stopped on the landing, the door opened. Wendell, an African-Caribbean man of about 40, stared at me in a way I didn’t expect from a welcoming therapist. He tilted his head to one side as if to say: “What’s the story?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/16/a-moment-that-changed-me-i-visited-a-therapist-who-offered-me-an-exorcism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After years of progress, a surge in rebel attacks has revived painful memories around the park in DRC, which also faces a threat of drilling within its boundaries</p><p>When Justin Katenga arrived at Matebe power station at dawn, the fighting was already under way. He had woken up a few miles away, in the headquarters of Virunga national park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), to the sound of heavy artillery echoing across the valley, underscoring the urgency of the evacuation planned for civilian staff in the facilities across the river from the frontline.</p><p>As Katenga entered the plant’s perimeter with his team, bullets whistled above their heads, lodging in the buildings’ walls; one engineer fainted in fear on the spot. Katenga, the deputy south sector warden of the park, took time to talk to the guards who had stayed behind to secure the site. The M23 rebel militia – fighting government forces in the area – had been gaining ground and were expected to break through and overrun that section of the park. Yet abandoning it would cut off 80% of the power supply to Goma, the capital city of North Kivu province and home to 2 million people.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/nov/16/can-virunga-national-park-survive-more-conflict-and-a-new-hunt-for-oil">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Catwalks are more diverse than ever on paper. But at the high-profile shows this season, it was all about the flat stomach</p><p>Sometimes fashion is about clothes, but sometimes it is really about bodies. The Council of Fashion Designers of America awards are the highest honours awarded to US fashion designers, so you would expect the star-studded New York gala to be a showcase for extraordinary clothes. But last week the red carpet was won not by a dress, but by a body. Uncut Gems actor Julia Fox wore a cutout dress that was mostly cutout, with a side order of dress. Baring Fox from her breastbone to her thighs, it revealed a black bikini and highlighted a carved-out, rock-hard midsection, visible ribs and sinewy glutes. Her slender body, not the dress, was the outfit.</p><p>The standout trend at this season’s catwalk shows was the flat stomach. At Fendi, ribs were visible under tissue-thin knitwear tucked into cargo pants that hung below the models’ hipbones. At Versace there was a long plane of taut bare flesh between the bumster-style waistband on a pair of jeans and the tiny bra top. Second-skin catsuits came in black lace at Burberry and crystal mesh at Stella McCartney. All of these were worn on the catwalk by models with the low body fat necessary for bones, cavities and ridges of muscle to be clearly visible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/nov/16/it-feels-like-the-progress-is-getting-reversed-how-fashion-fell-out-of-love-with-curves">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Expect months of self-pity as Republicans inch away from the ex-president and Ron DeSantis gains steam</p><p>The guy who spawned an insurrection in January 2021 is back. On Tuesday night, Donald Trump launched his bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. In front of Mar-a-Lago’s fawning faithful, he attacked Joe Biden and lamented the state of the US in his own absence. “Embarrassed”, “humiliated” and “glory” emerged as the evening’s buzzwords.</p><p>The speech sounded like a rehash of his inaugural address. The US has been warned. Unless “45” goes to prison sometime soon, expect the coming months to be a constant pity-party, fueled by a bottomless pit of grievances. In his own words, he is “persecuted” and a “victim”. His son Eric is the unfair recipient of a passel of subpoenas.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/15/trump-election-2024-chances">Continue reading...</a>

<p>To ‘move on’ from Trumpism, is to fall victim to the dangerous historical amnesia to which Americans seem so susceptible</p><p>In the general relief that has followed the midterm elections, we’ve been hearing that Donald Trump is losing his grip on the Republican party and that his popularity with the electorate has waned. The evidence seems clear: most, if not all, of the candidates he backed in crucial political races were defeated, as were the far-right extremists and the 2020 election deniers.</p><p>It’s hard not to be cheered by the indications that the country hasn’t entirely lost its collective mind.

In the least surprising news of the year, a low-energy Donald Trump announced that he is running for president again last night. The speech itself was also predictable, hitting the traditional authoritarian and nativist favorites. We heard about the “invasion” at the border and “radical Democrats” in the White House, all spiced up with the usual combination of self-complimenting anecdotes and self-serving lies that we have come to expect from the former president.</p><p>What was much more interesting was the almost complete absence of prominent Republicans in Mar-a-Lago and even the lukewarm interest of the US media. At various channels, journalists were “analyzing” Trump’s run while the former president was giving his speech on mute in the background. Even Fox News’s Sean Hannity cut into the speech after a little over half an hour.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/15/oh-how-donald-trump-has-fallen">Continue reading...</a>
