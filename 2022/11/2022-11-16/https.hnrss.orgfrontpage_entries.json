We're starting with a tool to catch JavaScript regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor and Google. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching JavaScript regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from automatic UI previews to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite (few days per week) founding engineer to join our team of four.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=\"https://sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site/Meticulous-values-ab2b90d3324447d58f0720481081c9a6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site/Meticulous-values...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with \u201cHN\u201d in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33630503\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33630503</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2023/CPSC-Warns-Consumers-to-Stop-Using-Onewheel-Self-Balancing-Electric-Skateboards-Due-to-Ejection-Hazard-At-Least-Four-Deaths-and-Multiple-Injuries-Reported", "title": "CPSC calls for full recall of all Onewheel self-balancing electric skateboards", "date_published": "2022-11-16 20:41:45+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2023/CPSC-Warns-Consumers-to-Stop-Using-Onewheel-Self-Balancing-Electric-Skateboards-Due-to-Ejection-Hazard-At-Least-Four-Deaths-and-Multiple-Injuries-Reported\">https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2023/CPSC-Warns-Consumers-to-Stop-Using-Onewheel-Self-Balancing-Electric-Skateboards-Due-to-Ejection-Hazard-At-Least-Four-Deaths-and-Multiple-Injuries-Reported</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33630220\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33630220</a></p>\n<p>Points: 34</p>\n<p># Comments: 12</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV0cR_Nhac0", "title": "Robot treats 500k plants per hour with 95% less chemicals [video]", "date_published": "2022-11-16 20:39:01+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV0cR_Nhac0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV0cR_Nhac0</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33630179\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33630179</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23462333/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-cryptocurrency-effective-altruism-crypto-bahamas-philanthropy", "title": "Sam Bankman-Fried tries to explain himself", "date_published": "2022-11-16 20:36:47+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23462333/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-cryptocurrency-effective-altruism-crypto-bahamas-philanthropy\">https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23462333/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-cryptocurrency-effective-altruism-crypto-bahamas-philanthropy</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33630150\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33630150</a></p>\n<p>Points: 124</p>\n<p># Comments: 118</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://github.com/teslamotors/liblithium", "title": "Liblithium: A lightweight and portable cryptography library", "date_published": "2022-11-16 20:29:33+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/teslamotors/liblithium\">https://github.com/teslamotors/liblithium</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33630057\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33630057</a></p>\n<p>Points: 16</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33629900", "title": "Tell HN: Facebook Messenger is testing in-call video ads", "date_published": "2022-11-16 20:17:58+00:00", "description": "<p>A few minutes ago I was calling my family, and had a 15-second video ad after they picked up.

Growth teams have so much marketing and advertising data, yet this siloed data is not actionable.<p>The existing BI and search-driven analytics solutions are designed for data-savvy people. In our experience (previously built an NLP company called FriendlyData), non-technical people just don't know what questions to ask.<p>So we decided to try a different approach: Narrative BI automatically generates a personalized feed of insights. You just need to connect your data sources (takes 2 min to set up), and you will get automated narratives, alerts, and reports in minutes.<p>We currently support UA, GA4, Google Ads, and Facebook Ads, but many more integrations will be added soon.<p>You can try it out for free and give feedback or roast it in the comments section. Just connect your data source, and you'll start getting narratives in 5 minutes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33627953\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33627953</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://daniel.do/article/laying-myself-off-from-amazon/", "title": "Laying myself off from Amazon", "date_published": "2022-11-16 18:00:13+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://daniel.do/article/laying-myself-off-from-amazon/\">https://daniel.do/article/laying-myself-off-from-amazon/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33627563\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33627563</a></p>\n<p>Points: 60</p>\n<p># Comments: 16</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-cut-10-000-employees-from-corporate-ranks-11668617313", "title": "Amazon confirms corporate staff cuts that could hit 10k employees", "date_published": "2022-11-16 17:27:05+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-cut-10-000-employees-from-corporate-ranks-11668617313\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-cut-10-000-employees-from-corporate-ranks-11668617313</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33626896\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33626896</a></p>\n<p>Points: 72</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://reason.com/2022/11/16/suburban-mom-jailed-handcuffed-cps-son-walk-home/", "title": "Mom Handcuffed, Jailed for 8-Year-Old Son Walking Half a Mile", "date_published": "2022-11-16 17:12:34+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://reason.com/2022/11/16/suburban-mom-jailed-handcuffed-cps-son-walk-home/\">https://reason.com/2022/11/16/suburban-mom-jailed-handcuffed-cps-son-walk-home/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33626670\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33626670</a></p>\n<p>Points: 50</p>\n<p># Comments: 25</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/firezone/jobs/BvqYd3f-founding-engineer", "title": "Firezone (YC W22) is hiring engineers to build open-source secure access", "date_published": "2022-11-16 17:01:11+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/firezone/jobs/BvqYd3f-founding-engineer\">https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/firezone/jobs/BvqYd3f-founding-engineer</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33626448\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33626448</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.highflux.io/blog/what-makes-git-hard-to-use", "title": "What makes Git so hard to use?", "date_published": "2022-11-16 16:52:53+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.highflux.io/blog/what-makes-git-hard-to-use\">https://www.highflux.io/blog/what-makes-git-hard-to-use</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33626284\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33626284</a></p>\n<p>Points: 30</p>\n<p># Comments: 36</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33626049", "title": "Ask HN: How I get a job that uses C?", "date_published": "2022-11-16 16:41:45+00:00", "description": "<p>My wife is pregnant and I need a job urgently... and like when I needed a job urgently in the past to pay student loans, I feel inclined to accept whatever offer I get.<p>But what I really wanted was work with C.

06:33:18+00:00", "description": "<p>The thought of returning to corporate working kind of disgusts me. daily meetings, middle management bs, politics, bureaucracy... im sure your familiar with the typical complaints.<p>Ive realized I don't seem to have any money generating skills, the only thing I seem actually be good at is making money for other people.<p>So im wondering if anyone has been able to use their coding skill to make a living that isn't working in a business.<p>Things ive tried and thought about(please correct anything that seems wrong!):<p>monetizing hobbies - I see why people don't recommend this, im not good enough anyway. to old to go pro at sports, not good enough or have credentials to teach.<p>coding tutoring and teaching - i tried this on codementor.io, there's more mentors then people needing help, its competitive and doesn't pay much when you consider how much extra work goes into it. I also don't have a CS degree so it doesn't seem like I can teach at a school. Maybe there are better ways to teach?<p>bug bounty chasing - I thought this would be easier then it really is. i guess its like a whole different skill set, interesting as a hobby but its going to take to long to get good. and its competitive<p>make a company or sell a thing software thing - I can code up my dream ideas with ease, what i don't know how to do is market anything or get users. seems to be another skill that will take months and maybe not even turn out to do anything<p>freelance - compared to just working rates seem low and its hard to find work from what ive seen<p>If you have cool ideas or something worked out for you, id be interested in hearing them! Otherwise I need to get working on a resume, id rather not!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a
