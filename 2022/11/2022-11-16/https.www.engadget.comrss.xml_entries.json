On Wednesday, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), the union that hopes to represent the workers, <a href=\"https://www.goiam.org/news/st-louis-apple-store-employees-file-for-election-to-join-machinists-union/\"><ins>said</ins></a> it filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board to hold a unionization vote. IAM says it hopes to represent about 82 employees in the effort.</p><p>The union previously filed a complaint with the NLRB accusing Apple of subjecting it workers to captive audience meetings where management presented anti-union talking points. In June, IAM helped employees at the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-store-employees-maryland-vpote-004055231.html\">Towson Town Center location</a> in Maryland become the first Apple Store union in the US to unionize.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Apple did not immediately respond to Engadget\u2019s request for comment. The petition comes as more of the company\u2019s retail workers look to organize their workplace. Earlier this month, Apple Store employees in Glasgow overwhelmingly voted in favor of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-store-glasgow-scotland-vote-to-unionize-182001646.html\"><ins>joining the GMB Union</ins></a>. In doing so, Apple Glasgow is now on track to form the first unionized Apple Store in the United Kingdom. Stateside, the company has so far seen two retail locations vote to unionize, with a handful more working to organize. Employees at those stores have accused the company of employing union-busting tactics, including limiting access to pro-union fliers. In the case of Towson Town Center, organizers say the company is also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23427577/apple-union-maryland-letter-benefits-contract\"><ins>withholding new benefits from union members</ins></a>.</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-ar2-gen-1-platform-augmented-reality-glasses-230017922.html?src=rss", "title": "Qualcomm's new Snapdragon platform is built for slim augmented reality glasses", "date_published": "2022-11-16 23:00:17+00:00", "description": "<p>If companies are going to make augmented reality glasses you'd <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-wireless-ar-glasses-reference-design-120017953.html\">actually want to wear</a>, they'll need chips that are powerful but won't require a large battery on your head. Qualcomm thinks it can help. The company has <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/products/application/xr-vr-ar/snapdragon-ar2-gen-1-platform\">unveiled</a> a Snapdragon AR2 Gen 1 platform that's built with slim AR glasses in mind. The multi-chip design reportedly delivers 2.5 times the AI performance of the company's XR2-based reference design while using half the power. You could have eyewear that intelligently detects objects in the room while remaining slim and light enough to use for hours at a time.</p><p>Part of the trick is to spread the computing load across the glasses' frame, Qualcomm says. The primary, 4nm-based AR processor includes a CPU, Tensor AI processing, graphics and engines for features like visual analytics. It can support up to nine simultaneous cameras for tracking both your body and the world around you. A co-processor elsewhere in the glasses includes an AI accelerator for tasks like eye tracking and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mit-computer-vision-algorithm-identifies-images-down-to-the-pixel-130051112.html\">computer vision</a>, while a third chip handles connectivity to networks and phones. This not only better-balances the weight, but leads to smaller circuit boards and fewer wires than you'd see with a single do-it-all chip.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>That networking is also important, Qualcomm says. Like Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in phones, AR2 Gen 1 is one of the first platforms to support <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mediatek-dimensity-9200-phone-soc-080033338.html\">WiFi 7</a>. That's crucial not just to provide the gobs of bandwidth for connecting to a handset (up to 5.8Gbps), but to reduce latency (under 2ms to your phone, according to Qualcomm). Combined with lag reduction in the processor and co-processor, you should have a more natural-feeling and responsive experience.</p><p>Hardware built on AR2 Gen 1 is in \"various stages\" of progress at multiple well-known companies, including Lenovo, LG, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nreal-air-augmented-reality-glasses-us-ios-mac-130041246.html\">Nreal</a>, Oppo and Xiaomi. Importantly, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-qualcomm-ar-glasses-chip-201404619.html\">Microsoft had a hand</a> in the platform requirements. Don't be surprised if you're one day using AR2 for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-mesh-holograms-hololens-ar-vr-164001796.html\">virtual collaboration in Mesh</a>, not to mention other Microsoft apps and services.</p><p>Qualcomm has also introduced meaningful updates to its audio technology. New <a href=\"http://www.qualcomm.com/products/application/audio/qualcomm-s3-gen-2-sound-platform\">S3 Gen 2 Sound</a> and <a href=\"http://www.qualcomm.com/products/application/audio/qualcomm-s5-gen-2-sound-platform\">S5 Gen 2 Sound</a> platforms promise to make the latest listening tech more commonplace, including spatial audio with head tracking, lower latency for games and the latest take on adaptive active noise cancellation (think of the transparency modes found on some earbuds).

To try Notion AI, you\u2019ll need to <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/product/ai\">sign up for a waitlist</a> and wait for an invite from the company. As for who this is for, Zhao said he envisions the software solving the \u201ccold start\u201d problem a lot of people face when they sit down to write something. The idea isn\u2019t so much for Notion AI to produce a piece that\u2019s ready to publish right away, but it could give you a first draft you can revise and polish into something that you\u2019re comfortable sharing with the world.

What\u2019s more, edibles and concentrates continue to rise in popularity among all age groups, from boomers to doomers. This increased demand for vape cartridges \u2014 both near-ubiquitous 510-threads like those from Rove or more specialized carts like the Pax Era Pods \u2014 has led to their increased production and, in turn, their inevitable arrival in American landfills. In California, the nation\u2019s largest legal cannabis market, 510 cartridges are quite popular but, due to the state\u2019s strict hazardous waste disposal regulations, difficult to dispose of in a responsible manner.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>On the production side, virtually every ingredient, component, growth medium, nutrient, castoff, trimming, and scrap is carefully destroyed, typically either dismantled on-site or rendered unusable before being shipped to a certified waste facility.  At the cultivation level, Taylor Vozniak, Sales and Marketing Manager for California cannabis waste management company <a href=\"https://www.gaiaca.com/\">Gaiaca</a>, told Engadget, \u201cit would be plants after they've been trimmed, grow medium \u2014 that's either going to be soil or rock wool or cocoa husk \u2014 any sort of water nutrients or pesticides.\u201d</p><div id=\"f9125943a7d14bad9ccc27780860ee3a\"></div><p>At the manufacturing stage, the company handles post-production green waste (think, mashed up stems and leaves) as well as hazardous waste like concentrate solvents and failed edible product batches like misshapen canna-gummies or burned weed brownies \u2014 the latter must be destroyed on-site to stay within bounds of the <a href=\"https://cannabis.ca.gov/licensees/track-and-trace/\">California Cannabis Track and Trace (CCTT) system</a> operated by the state\u2019s <a href=\"https://cannabis.ca.gov/\">Department of Cannabis Control</a>. The CCTT extends to the point of sale, meaning that local dispensaries are responsible for seeing returned product and defective merchandise properly destroyed.</p><p>\u201cSingle-use batteries have been a big sticking point for a while now,\u201d Vozniak said. \u201cWe're proud that we can recycle those vape batteries either with or without cannabis.\u201d As it turns out, much of the underlying impetus for the creation of the CCTT system, Vozniak notes, is to prevent this waste from being illicitly harvested and resold. \u201cThe overarching way these regulations were written the way they were is to prevent any sort of product going into the black market,\u201d he noted, which is why cannabis by-products, which is what all the stuff above is considered, has to be rendered into inert \u201cwaste\u201d before it gets put in the ground. It\u2019s also why your local dispensary doesn\u2019t have a drop-off bin for used cartridges.</p><p>Products are handled slightly differently depending on whether they\u2019re THC or CBD-based. \u201cCBD is federally legal,\u201d Vozniak said \u2014 so that it can be transported across state lines for disposal, \u201cwhile THC is state-by-state regulated. A lot of the time you'll see, especially in California, CBD destroyed on site, but I have a client in Dallas who I've been able to just take their product as-is off site to a disposal facility.\u201d</p><p>The materials that can be directly recycled or composted, will be. The six-month composting process is sufficient to leach out and fully decay any leftover THC before the material is repackaged and sold as a gardening amendment. Less sustainable materials like used nitrile gloves, non-recyclable or food-contaminated packaging will instead be routed to local landfills and incinerators. But not vape cartridges. Those, along with the Li-ion batteries that power them, are considered e-waste in California so there\u2019s a litany of additional regulatory hurdles to jump through before throwing one away.</p><p>\u201cWhat ends up happening is you'll be able to take [used carts and batteries] to a recycling vendor for a while,\u201d Vozniak said, until \u201cthey realize it's a difficult product to deal with, so we'll have to find new vendors.\u201d</p><figure><img alt=\"Ted Chase points the amount left in his medical marijuana vape cartridge.

You can\u2019t very well clean, sort, and disassemble these items by hand; as e-waste, they\u2019re sorted, cleaned and then repeatedly mechanically shredded and resorted into progressively smaller chunks until they\u2019re reduced and separated into their constituent materials. Vape pen batteries, both rechargeable and single-use all-in-one varieties, go through a similar process, Vizniak explains. They\u2019re first statically separated by density, then dipped into liquid nitrogen to instantly freeze and deactivate the lithium ion cells before they\u2019re pulverized with mechanical hammers and further sorted for commodity sale.</p><p>If that seems like a whole lot of work for such tiny devices, you\u2019re not wrong. Despite the legal cannabis industry in California existing for less than a decade, much of the verbiage of Prop 54 is already falling out of relevance. \u201cWhen things were first written, there was a lack of understanding of how the cannabis industry would end up operating,\u201d Vozniak said. He points to all-in-one (AIO) pen battery disposal as one such example.</p><p>\u201cWe still have to destroy these products on site \u2014 and I understand the concern there, they [state regulators] don't want anything going to the black market \u2014 but for these all-in-one-pens, there really is no way to destroy them without putting the operators at risk,\u201d he continued. \u201cA lot of times, operators are going to try to destroy these products themselves because Gaica can be on the more expensive side just because of the nature of what we do. It's very labor intensive.\u201d</p><p>Vozniak has seen cannabis retailers encase old AIOs in blocks of resin to deactivate them \u2014 whole drums of resin-ensconced lithium batteries that no recycler would ever take \u2014 in order to comply with the state\u2019s \u201cdestroy on-site\u201d order. Vozniak argues that a basic exemption to that rule specifically for cannabis e-waste could, \u201creally help the industry out because that's really what I'm seeing most \u2014 out of state as well.\u201d</p><p>In addition to contacting their district and state representatives to advocate for regulatory amendments, vape pen users looking to reduce their consumption footprints have a number of options. <a href=\"https://openvapeshop.com/blogs/news/best-refillable-vape-cartridges\">Refillable 510 cartridges are a thing</a> \u2014 they operate just as the single-use canisters from the dispensary do but have a screw-on lid for injecting fresh oil \u2014 such as the <a href=\"https://www.kandypens.com/flacko-jodye-oil-glass-tank.html\">Flacko Jodye</a> from KandyPens, the <a href=\"https://pcktbrand.com/products/sprk-ceramic-cartridge\">SPRK ceramic</a> from PCKT, an all-in-one kit from <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2tpYXJhbmF0dXJhbHMuY29tL3VrL2J1eS9jYmQtdmFwaW5nLXBlbnMvY2JkLW9pbC1kaXN0aWxsYXRlLXZhcGUtcGVuLWtpdC8_cGlkPTIzMzImb2lkPTEyNiZ0aWQ9MTAyNTQ3OTBmODUyYzZmNjQ5ZmNjZWI4Y2YxMWMyIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmODYxOTQyNC03OGRmLTQ2OTQtYWNiOC01YTRhNWU0MjgwYTMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUvNFvM3tZbr3J1YIhvHKY2fFiivBwbqTVOjBkeVRGup&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fkiaranaturals.com%2Fuk%2Fbuy%2Fcbd-vaping-pens%2Fcbd-oil-distillate-vape-pen-kit%2F%3Fpid%3D2332%26oid%3D126%26tid%3D10254790f852c6f649fcceb8cf11c2\">Kiara Naturals</a>, or the Puffco Plus.

In an ideal world, everyone would have a dedicated food processor, countertop blender and a stand mixer. But the reality is that many people don\u2019t have the room or the budget.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Engadget's favorite immersion blenders are the Breville Control Grip, the KitchenAid Cordless Variable Speed Hand Blender and the Hamilton Beach 2-Speed Hand Blender\n\n\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-05/51e75ca0-d2ea-11ec-aff7-1c49976875d8\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford/Engadget\n </div></figure><p>While immersion blenders and traditional countertop models have a lot of overlap, there are strengths and weaknesses to both. For example, if you\u2019re looking to make smoothies every day, a countertop blender might be a better choice. The bigger pitchers make it easier to blend drinks for multiple people at once, while larger motors will make short work of ice and frozen fruit. Additionally, more expensive options like those from Vitamix or Robocoupe can even cook soup during the blending process using the heat generated from the blender\u2019s motor, which isn\u2019t something you can do with an immersion model. I\u2019d even go so far as to say that if you have the space for it and don\u2019t own a blender of any kind, a countertop version is probably the best option for most people.</p><p>That said, immersion blenders are often less expensive and, thanks to a wide variety of accessories offered by some manufacturers, they can be great multitaskers. A whisk attachment allows you to make whipped cream or meringues quickly without needing an electric hand mixer, or risk getting tendonitis in your elbow doing it manually. Some immersion blenders also come with food processing bowls, so you can easily throw together things like a homemade pesto in minutes. And because immersion blenders are smaller and less bulky than traditional models, they're a great choice for apartment dwellers or anyone with limited storage or counter space. That means if you\u2019re simply trying to expand your culinary repertoire without blowing up your budget, an immersion blender can be a great way to try something new without committing too hard.</p><h2>Corded or cordless?</h2><p>Similar to figuring out if you should get a blender or not, trying to decide between a corded or cordless model depends a lot on the other gadgets you already own. Corded versions typically have more powerful motors, which makes them great for people who don\u2019t have a countertop blender or food processor. But if you do own one of both of those, cordless is the way to go. Not only do you get the convenience of not worrying about wires, but the ease of use makes it fast and easy to whip out your immersion blender to add some extra texture to a soup or sauce.</p><h2>A quick word about safety</h2><figure><img alt=\"The most important safety tip for immersion blenders is to always keep the blade pointed down and away from you. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-05/b7701940-d2ea-11ec-ab3b-54d8d4c00192\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford/Engadget\n </div></figure><p>No one should be ashamed of being nervous around a device that is essentially a motorized blending wand with a spinning blade at the end. But with proper care and use, an immersion blender doesn\u2019t have to be much more dangerous than a chef\u2019s knife. The most important safety tip is to make sure you always keep the sharp end pointed down and away from you or anyone else nearby. That includes your hands, along with any utensils (like a spoon), that might be in or around your mixing bowl.</p><p>Thankfully, all consumer immersion blenders are designed to prevent their blade from directly hitting the vessel holding your food (be it a mixing bowl or a pot). However, to be extra safe, you should avoid blending things in glass containers or non-stick cookware, as glass can chip or shatter while the metal blades and shroud of an immersion blender can damage teflon and ceramic.</p><figure><img alt=\"Immersion blenders are extremely useful kitchen gadgets, especially when it comes to making creamy soups like this roasted cauliflower chowder. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-05/ee5a0560-d2ea-11ec-a7bf-96fd2a31d9bb\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford/Engadget\n </div></figure><p>You\u2019ll also want to make sure you keep water away from the plug or outlet of corded immersion blenders. And if you want to remove the blade or clear away any food that might have gotten tangled, first make sure the blender is off and disconnected from its power source (either its battery or wall socket).</p><p>On the bright side, cleaning an immersion is rather simple and straightforward. All you have to do is fill up a bowl or cup with soapy water, submerge the immersion blender, and then run it for 10 to 20 seconds. That\u2019s it. If it\u2019s still not clean, you can repeat that process again until it is. And if that\u2019s too much work, the blending wand on a lot of models (including all of the gadgets on this list) are dishwasher safe too.</p><h2>Best wired immersion blender: Breville Control Grip</h2><p></p><p>Starting at $130, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CcmV2aWxsZS1CU0I1MTBYTC1Db250cm9sLUltbWVyc2lvbi1CbGVuZGVyL2RwL0IwMDRSRjdRSlc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tNW4tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIzMzA3OTA4LWYzZWQtNDQ3OC04ZjljLWNkMTQxOTQzYTYzOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASzjazopjmGcQ_rKLfey691TiV5mXnKpeowRlAANKGP0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBreville-BSB510XL-Control-Immersion-Blender%2Fdp%2FB004RF7QJW\">Breville\u2019s Control Grip</a> not only has one of the most powerful motors (280-watts) available on a corded immersion blender in this price range, it also comes with a wealth of handy accessories. In addition to the main 8-inch shaft/immersion blade, the kit features a 25-ounce chopping bowl for cutting and mincing and a 42-ounce blending jug for making soups and smoothies. There\u2019s also a whisk attachment, which means that between all of its accessories, the Control Grip can take the place of three different common kitchen gadgets: a food processor, traditional blender and hand mixer.</p><p>I also appreciate the two-button attachment system, which ensures accessories are properly locked in before use. Breville even includes a removable blade guard to help prevent the blender from scratching your other appliances in storage. And with support for 15 different speed settings, there\u2019s a lot of flexibility to handle all sorts of dishes. Alternatively, if you\u2019re looking for an all-purpose immersion blender with even more attachments for making drinks and pureeing soup, you may want to consider <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9LaXRjaGVuQWlkLUtIQjI1NjFDVS01LVNwZWVkLUhhbmQtQmxlbmRlci9kcC9CMDA1UUlZS1ZHP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTVuLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMzMwNzkwOC1mM2VkLTQ0NzgtOGY5Yy1jZDE0MTk0M2E2MzkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaMM70WrkPEgiEPvs5w6U1E0jsgp0FInlSUefQ2Og6PF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKitchenAid-KHB2561CU-5-Speed-Hand-Blender%2Fdp%2FB005QIYKVG\">KitchenAid\u2019s 5-Speed Hand Blender</a>, which comes with two extra bell blades to help crush ice, whisk egg whites and more.</p><h2>Best cordless immersion blender: KitchenAid Cordless Variable Speed Hand Blender</h2><p></p><p>If you just want an immersion blender that\u2019s simple and easy to use, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9LaXRjaGVuQWlkLUtIQkJWNTNCTS1Db3JkbGVzcy1CbGVuZGVyLUJsYWNrL2RwL0IwOEJSMzk0OUc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tNW4tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIzMzA3OTA4LWYzZWQtNDQ3OC04ZjljLWNkMTQxOTQzYTYzOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVkclLgVtsqDFGIJt5xJ6G6WXgECF8-BYLvD9Le-nNON&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKitchenAid-KHBBV53BM-Cordless-Blender-Black%2Fdp%2FB08BR3949G%3F\">KitchenAid\u2019s Cordless Variable Speed Blender</a> is the one to get. It comes with a dishwasher-safe blending jar and an optional pan guard to help ensure you won\u2019t nick your cookware. However, the real nifty feature is that instead of having discrete speed settings, you can adjust the blender\u2019s 180-watt motor simply by squeezing down on the trigger. This makes using it incredibly intuitive, and thanks to its built-in safety switch, it\u2019s much more difficult to spin up the blade by accident.</p><p>KitchenAid also claims the battery can blend up to 25 bowls of soup on a single charge. And while my kitchen is too small to test this properly, I never ran into any issues. That said, you\u2019re going to want to make sure to top off its battery beforehand because its charging port is next to where you attach the blending arm, which means you can\u2019t have it plugged in while it's running.</p><h2>Best budget immersion blender: Hamilton Beach 2-Speed Hand Blender</h2><p></p><p>For those who want something that\u2019s versatile and a great value, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9IYW1pbHRvbi1CZWFjaC01OTc2NS1TcGVlZC1CbGVuZGVyL2RwL0IwMDNOUUU4QjA_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tNW4tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIzMzA3OTA4LWYzZWQtNDQ3OC04ZjljLWNkMTQxOTQzYTYzOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYjO1A19rTH4uRq6RNiX7vNRkj6ilhEI0OSP0mMNs0Hz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHamilton-Beach-59765-Speed-Blender%2Fdp%2FB003NQE8B0%3F\">Hamilton Beach\u2019s 2-Speed Hand Blender</a> is a great pick. While it isn\u2019t cordless, in addition to the main blending arm you also get a whisk attachment and a chopping bowl \u2013 all for just $35. On top of that, its 225-watt motor is rather powerful for its price, though you don\u2019t get as many speed settings as you would on more premium rivals. With this thing having been on the market for more than 15 years, this blender has long been a top choice among budget-conscious cooks.</p><p></p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/samsung-game-streaming-2021-tv-models-160009155.html?src=rss", "title": "Samsung brings game streaming to its 2021 TVs", "date_published": "2022-11-16 16:00:09+00:00", "description": "<p>You no longer need one of Samsung's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-2022-tv-hands-on-neo-8-k-qled-oled-150043989.html\">latest TVs</a> to try its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-cloud-gaming-platform-smart-tvs-streaming-020040703.html\">game streaming features</a>. The electronics giant is now rolling out cloud gaming to compatible 2021 TV sets. This includes all 2021 models, ranging from entry AU7000 series through to 8K flagships like the QN900. You can find the full list below this story. You should have access to streaming services by the end of 2022, Samsung says. There is a caveat: you'll need a Q70A, AU8000 or certain QN90A (98-inch) and Q60A (32-inch) models to get the full Gaming Hub, not just individual apps.&nbsp;</p><p>You'll also have easy access to 4K games. Samsung says GeForce Now will stream in 4K on 2022 and \"select\" 2021 TVs within a few weeks. You'll need the GeForce Now <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-now-introduces-an-rtx-3080-tier-for-up-to-1440-p-120-fps-gaming-130011568.html\">RTX 3080 subscription</a> to get that higher resolution, but it may be worthwhile if you intend to use your TV as a substitute for a high-end gaming PC.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The company also hopes some gaming bonuses will encourage you to buy a new TV. A promo running until the end of the year will give you both a free Xbox controller and three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate when you buy the QN85B, QN90B, QN95B, QN800B, QN850B, QN900B or S95B. You'll get just the three-month Game Pass freebie if you buy a Q60B or Q80B. We wouldn't buy a set solely with these extras in mind, but they could tip the balance if you already had cloud games in mind.</p><p>The range of services is expanding at the same time, however slightly. Antstream Arcade's collection of roughly 1,500 classic games will be available to stream in 2023, as will Blacknut's over 500 family-friendly titles. They probably won't be as appealing as major services like Game Pass, GeForce Now and Amazon's Luna.

Instead of just the usual <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gopro-hero-11-review-125905853.html\">flagship camera</a>, a \u201cMini\u201d version was also unveiled. Alas, only the regular Hero Black was available when they were announced, so if the diminutive version caught your eye you had to wait until Oct 25th. And then you had to wait <a href=\"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/gopro-hero-11-black-mini-131839689.html\">just a little bit longer</a>. But finally it\u2019s here and it\u2019s an interesting proposition.</p><p>Of course, the pitch is simple: A Hero 11 Black but smaller. The Mini is about 3/4 of an inch narrower than the regular Hero 11 Black when you look at it head on. But it\u2019s also a teensy bit taller and about 5mm deeper. It\u2019s obviously smaller overall, but there\u2019s much less of a difference than there was with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-07-gopro-hero5-black-session-review.html\">Session cameras and the flagship of the time</a>. As with that camera, though, the main trade off is the lack of viewfinder/displays. That\u2019s a big deal, so that reduction in size really has to appeal to your use case. And I can say right up top here, for <em>most</em> people, it likely doesn\u2019t.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>To put things in perspective, at the time of writing, the Mini sells for $299.98 with a GoPro subscription, while the regular Hero 11 Black is listed for $349.98 with the same deal ($449.98 / $549.98 respectively if for some reason you can\u2019t take the subscription offer). That\u2019s either a $50 or $100 difference, depending, for the overall compromises and relatively minor difference in size. And there are additional differences beyond the lack of screen that you\u2019ll want to consider. For example, there's no photo mode this time around.</p><figure><img alt=\"A picture of a football pitch at dusk which was take from a video of the same shot by the GoPro Hero 11 Black Mini.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/f544a510-6502-11ed-bfef-cbed70d15378\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>To be clear, yes you can get photos out of the camera (there\u2019s one right above this sentence) but you\u2019ll be pulling frames from video. And while that\u2019s pretty easy, it\u2019s definitely not as simple as choosing photo mode and pressing a button (also your photos might end up 16:9 if that\u2019s what the source material is). Taking photos is definitely something you might assume you can do natively and I am obliged therefore to tell you that you cannot.</p><p>Of course, as mentioned, there\u2019s no touchscreen which affects how you access the menu. You can navigate the settings via a small display on the top that will send GoPro veterans right back to the Hero 4 (and earlier) days. The options here are slightly limited, with just shooting mode, mode settings and some (but not all) general settings up for grabs. Everything else you\u2019ll be doing through the app.</p><p>I personally prefer doing most things on the camera itself, and then use the app when the camera is mounted out of reach, but I didn\u2019t find it hard to transition to doing most everything in Quik. This only really becomes an issue if you\u2019re doing something where your phone isn\u2019t nearby. Surfing, for example, might need a little bit of pre-planning to make sure you\u2019re set up before you get in the water.</p><figure><img alt=\"Both the regular GoPro Hero 11 Black and the Mini are pictured back to back for size comparison.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/f6662530-6503-11ed-abff-c366410a845d\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Relatedly, I noticed the camera goes into standby very quickly. After just <em>eight</em> seconds of inactivity the Mini will turn itself off (15 if you\u2019re in the settings menu). This is obviously to save battery life, but it also means if you were just pausing for thought, you have to turn the camera back on, and possibly re-connect to the camera over WiFi and then pick up where you left off. It feels like an easy fix to add an option to change the amount of time, but for now, that\u2019s how it is.</p><p>If you are used to using GoPro\u2019s video presets, it\u2019s worth knowing there\u2019s only one here on the Mini. Unlike the regular Hero 11 that offers many along with the option to create your own for different shooting scenarios, the Mini has the essentials and not much else. It just means you need to change your video settings on a per-shot basis (like life before GoPro introduced presets) but it was something I found myself missing.</p><p>As for battery life, there\u2019s good news and bad news. The bad news is that the sealed-design means you can\u2019t swap out a new cell should you run out of juice. The better news is that the Mini uses the new longer-lasting Enduro battery. GoPro claims you should get about an hour of continuous recording at the highest quality, or nearer to two hours are less demanding settings. This feels about right based on the short time we\u2019ve had with the camera and also inline with the Hero 11 Black, which uses the same battery.</p><p>Since the latest redesign and addition of 5.3K video modes, some people had issues with the camera overheating while recording indoors, with the camera in a fixed position. The company <a href=\"https://community.gopro.com/s/article/HERO10-Black-Video-Performance-Modes?language=en_US\">issued a software update</a> in response including a new \u201cstationary/tripod\u201d mode.</p><figure><img alt=\"GoPro Hero 11 Black Mini.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/fd948960-6507-11ed-b79f-f9839412ef98\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>When we tested our Hero 9, 10 and 11, we didn\u2019t experience that issue, but with the Mini, it happened pretty quickly (in under 10 minutes) when recording at 5.3K/60fps. In less power-hungry modes the issue disappeared, so anything 1080p, for example, was fine. GoPro\u2019s messaging here is that the Mini is an outdoor camera, designed for mounting on you or your gear.  So, if you were looking at this for a potential static/indoor application, it\u2019s not the camera you want, even according to GoPro.</p><p>If that seemed like a lot of words about things you can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t do, then the good news is that, from here on out, it\u2019s all about what the Mini <em>can</em> do. The short version of that is, mostly everything it\u2019s bigger sibling can. But it\u2019s worth calling out some specifics, and even a couple of things that are unique to the smaller camera.</p><p>The first thing I wanted to confirm was that the Mini had full 360-degree horizon lock. This was something new to the Hero 11 Black and it was one of the standout features this year. There was no reason why the Mini wouldn\u2019t be able to do this, with it having the same sensor and all, but consider this confirmation of that nonetheless.</p><p>The same goes for the new Hyperview mode, which squeezes every pixel from the sensor into a 16:9 video. It\u2019s incredibly immersive and makes even the most mundane of activities seem surprisingly dynamic. And of course, full-frame shooting is also here, so you can grab everything the sensor sees and then punch out different mobile-friendly or desktop videos from the same source file.</p><figure><img alt=\"A rear view of the GoPro Hero 11 Black Mini.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/9705cb40-6503-11ed-b967-47d551bc8d56\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Where the Mini excels, unsurprisingly, is with anything body mounted. The smaller form-factor and lighter weight make it a much nice experience for head or helmet mounting. In fact, I\u2019d go as far to say that the Mini is <em>all about </em>being a helmet cam. Not least because of the second pair of mounting fingers on the rear that make it easier to fix in a forward-facing position.</p><p>And this really feels like what the Mini is all about. If you don\u2019t want all the bells and whistles and just want an honest-to-goodness action camera with all the Hero 11 Black video credentials, then the Mini is it. It also feels like it would make a good secondary camera for a different angle. Similarly, if you use a full-size GoPro for drone FPV footage (rather than the dedicated \u201c<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/go-pros-bones-is-a-stripped-down-hero-10-black-for-fpv-drones-130002237.html\">Bones</a>\u201d camera) then the Mini is also a great option for that - plus you get a camera you can use elsewhere, too (unlike Bones).</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-gifts-for-travelers-141503089.html?src=rss", "title": "The best gifts for travelers in 2022", "date_published": "2022-11-16 14:15:03+00:00", "description": "<p>Be it for work or play, many people are taking trips again, which makes travel-related gifts an excellent idea.

And there\u2019s a bonus: It has a built-in foldable kickstand that will prop their iPhone up at a comfortable viewing angle, making it perfect for long flights. <em>\u2014 Nicole Lee, Commerce Writer</em></p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><a class=\"athena-button rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOTkyNVMzUjkvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTVqLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiZTExNWQ4YS0xZGZhLTRmYjktOTBhYS01NDI2YTZlZWIwNjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARxRrBFgZ1x86F1gISGna-4NkdR_ePrBg0hVodXOAtNg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09925S3R9%2F\" id=\"1fbea56a455f424cb970db7f69af3ef0\">Buy Anker 622 battery at Amazon - $60</a><h2>Ostrich Pillow Hot &amp; Cold Eye Mask</h2><figure><img alt=\"Ostrich Pillow Hot &amp; Cold Eye Mask\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/413da4e0-5535-11ed-bdfd-fc95e73ada03\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Ostrich</div></figure><p>Sleep masks are a travel essential.

Just plug it into a power outlet, flip the switch, and they\u2019ll have hot water in about six minutes. On a recent road trip, I used it not just for tea but also for making instant cup noodles in the middle of the night. It proved to be a savior for not just my sanity but those pesky midnight cravings as well. I also appreciate that the power cord and handle are detachable, making it easier to stow away. <em>\u2014 N.L.</em></p><a class=\"athena-button rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwN1BSR1hRQlMvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTVqLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiZTExNWQ4YS0xZGZhLTRmYjktOTBhYS01NDI2YTZlZWIwNjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbDbF1YUA_wpTD97XVVATam8U7F1ijqC-ZiuKQI40ZXC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07PRGXQBS%2F\" id=\"49e0948ebdcd41059f4ff470a379e4e5\">Buy foldable electric kettle at Amazon - $50</a><h2>Anker PowerCore 65W 2-in-1 power bank</h2><figure><img alt=\"Anker PowerCore 65W 2-in-1 power bank\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/e5f093d0-5535-11ed-a9f6-21fd787fdb3e\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>If you\u2019re looking for the mother of all chargers to take with you on your next trip, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOVcySDIyNEY_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tNWktMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImJlMTE1ZDhhLTFkZmEtNGZiOS05MGFhLTU0MjZhNmVlYjA2NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASw2gvzXfJ4afJ-PboW9ffQdMM317lY4h_bI5kCo3uBo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09W2H224F\">Anker\u2019s 733 2-in-1 power bank</a> is the one to get.

If you'll recall, things got so bad that Twitter had to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-subscriptions-not-working-134310199.html\">suspend</a> its subscription service, which offered instant verification and, hence, gave fake accounts a semblance of legitimacy. Musk had just <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-twitter-blue-verification-coming-back-november-29-000545608.html\">announced</a> yesterday that the company is pushing back the return of Blue verification to November 29th to make sure that it's \"rock solid.\"</p><p><em>The Post</em> also saw internal information and data externally compiled by a software developer that showed Twitter Blue only had around 150,000 users by the time the website paused subscriptions.

In addition, the US Space Force had to fix the radar that was going to track the rocket's launch, because it suddenly went offline.

By 1:50AM Eastern, SLS was leaving its launchpad. The Orion capsule successfully deployed its solar arrays a few minutes later, and the core stage's engines powered down so it could break away and fall into the Atlantic Ocean. The rocket's second stage will then fire its engine to send Orion on a trajectory to the Moon. It will also ultimately break away, leaving the crew vehicle to go on a four-week journey around the Moon before coming back to Earth. Somewhere along the way, the capsule will deploy 10 CubeSats designed to perform their own science investigations meant to help future deep space missions.</p><p>Artemis 1 will give NASA the data it needs to ensure that astronauts can safely fly to the Moon aboard the Orion capsule. It will also give the agency the opportunity to see whether the vehicle's heat shield can adequately protect the astronauts onboard when it re-enters our atmosphere and splashes down into the Pacific Ocean. If everything checks out, NASA will be able to start planning for Artemis 2, which will be Orion's first crewed mission and will send astronauts on a lunar flyby.</p><div id=\"0a674e1577ac410e8454f2012a7a1bfb\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">We are going.<br /><br />For the first time, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NASA_SLS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NASA_SLS</a> rocket and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NASA_Orion?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NASA_Orion</a> fly together. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Artemis?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Artemis</a> I begins a new chapter in human lunar exploration. <a href=\"https://t.co/vmC64Qgft9\">pic.twitter.com/vmC64Qgft9</a></p>\u2014 NASA (@NASA) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1592772202289430528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 16, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p></p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apple-us-made-chips-2024-053927685.html?src=rss", "title": "Apple reportedly plans to use US-made chips starting in 2024", "date_published": "2022-11-16 05:39:27+00:00", "description": "<p>Apple is gearing up to source chips from a factory in the US within the next couple of years, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-15/apple-prepares-to-get-made-in-us-chips-in-pivot-from-asia-supply\"><em>Bloomberg's</em></a> Mark Gurman.
