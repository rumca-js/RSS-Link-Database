  <p id="oYS2iR">Stressed, hungry bat populations are linked to growing cases of an emerging zoonotic disease in Australia, new research finds. The bats have learned to adapt to more persistent food shortages by roosting closer to humans. That raises the risk of the potentially fatal Hendra virus jumping from bats to horses to people, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05506-2">study</a> published today in the journal <em>Nature</em>.</p>

The company is starting to test <a href="https://www.notion.so/ai">a new feature today called Notion AI</a>, which Notion CEO Ivan Zhao tells me could ultimately change the way people use the app — and do their jobs. With Notion AI, all you have to do is tell the app what you want (a blog post, a recruiting email template, a list of great business books to read), and the app actually creates the content right in front of your eyes.</p>
<p id="lOd9lB">The first thing Notion AI is for, Zhao says, is writing. Lots of work requires writing, some of it repetitive (like creating new job descriptions) and some of it creative (like writing blog posts or brainstorming new ideas). Zhao thinks Notion AI can help in both cases. “For many users...</p>

  <p id="SVanG5">I still get flashbacks of the nightmarish launch of Nvidia’s 30-series graphics cards, with stock selling out faster than you could enter your credit card info.

<p id="P3aRSk">Hopefully, some retailers have learned from their mistakes and can provide a more streamlined experience because Nvidia’s 40-series graphics cards are here, and while the cost of admission is high, with the Founders Edition of the RTX 4080 going for $1,199.99, that won’t be enough to dissuade PC gamers hungry to be on the bleeding edge of performance. </p>
