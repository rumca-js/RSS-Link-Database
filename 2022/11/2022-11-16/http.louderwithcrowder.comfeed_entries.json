Now that the ratings are out for Dave Chappelle's episode of SNL, it shows you how silly controversy is. If anything, it added millions of viewers to the total, making everyone involved millions and millions of more dollars.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"26931\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32107674&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>Dave Chappelle was announced as a host for SNL, and people were <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-snl-outrage\" target=\"_blank\">upset over the last time Chappelle caused controversy</a> by telling jokes. Chappelle, knowing about the previous controversy (and the new controversy he was about to cause), <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-performed-fake-monologue\" target=\"_blank\">performed a fake monologue during SNL dress rehearsal</a> different from <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-snl\" target=\"_blank\">the one he performed live</a>. That's the one that <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-adl\" target=\"_blank\">caused a new controversy</a>. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"bbbb1\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32107702&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>A combination of the controversy and Dave Chappelle being funny had an adverse effect than the one haters hoping to cancel Chappelle wanted. <a href=\"https://www.outkick.com/dave-chappelle-snl-ratings/\" target=\"_blank\">Our friends at Outkick</a> looked at the ratings.</p><p>4,800,000 people tuned in to see Chappelle host SNL. The average rating for the year is only around four million.</p><p>And YouTube was a slaughter. The video of his monologue has over 8,200,000 views. In second place is Amy Schumer with only a million.</p><p>The funniest thing about those numbers is that it's all Chappelle. I couldn't tell you a single sketch that was on the show. The rest of the show could have been complete ass and the only thing funny was Chappelle's fifteen minutes. </p><p>It tells us that when people <em>THINK</em> a comedy show is going to be funny, they watch it. If not, they don't. Remarkable how that works.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

It's stuck it my head right now and I want to stab my brain with a Q-Tip.</p><p>While her song is, unfortunately, still legal, Carey can't sue anyone else who tries to monetize being a self-professed queen of Christmas. Thank Elizabeth Chan, who was dubbed the Queen of Christmas by a magazine in 2018 for putting out yule tide records every year for a decade. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-63647164?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Bbbc.news.twitter%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bnews%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D&amp;at_custom3=%40BBCWorld&amp;at_custom1=%5Bpost+type%5D&amp;at_custom4=3F3EE7B2-659D-11ED-BC24-D8A84744363C&amp;at_custom2=twitter&amp;at_medium=custom7&amp;at_campaign=64\" target=\"_blank\">She's the one who filed the challenge</a>.</p><blockquote><strong></strong>I feel very strongly that no one person should hold onto anything around Christmas or monopolize it in the way that Mariah seeks to in perpetuity.

They were either asleep, bad lawyers or busy listening to their client remind them about that time she used to date Derek Jeter. Americans are free to exploit the word \"Christmas\" and the holiday surrounding it without fear of legal discourse.</p><p>Besides, if anyone is going to call herself the Queen of Christmas, it's Kirsty MacColl. \"Fairytale of New York\" by The Pogues is the true #1 Christmas song that truly encapsulates the season. The top 100 goes #1 The Pogues, fill in a bunch of songs yourself for #2 - 98, the sound of two cats fighting inside of an inflatable Santa comes in at #99, and then Mariah Carey.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
