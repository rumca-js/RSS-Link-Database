Casino Royale (2006)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4058468-1.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Daniel Craig takes on the role of James Bond, more affectionately known as Agent 007 as he enters a high-stakes poker game. This is Bond's first mission as 007, and it's actually the second time the Ian Fleming novel of the same name has been made into a movie, with the first coming in 1967.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. The Hateful Eight: Extended Version</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4058469-2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Quentin Tarantino's western is a modern classic with a star-studded cast that includes a number of the director's regulars, along with names like Jennifer Jason Leigh and Demi\u00e1n Bichir. Expect plenty of vulgarity, violence, and everything else you expect from a director like Tarantino.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. It Follows</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4058470-3.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">One of the best horror movies so far of the 21st century, It Follows centers on a young woman who has sex with a guy one night, but afterward, he lets her know there's a supernatural entity following him. If it touches him, he dies, and now, it's after her. The film is unsettling and nerve-wracking as Maika Monroe's Jay navigates her cursed world, being haunted by the equivalent of a supernatural STD.</p><p>Side note: <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/12-horror-movies-on-shudder-that-are-dying-to-be-watched-this-halloween/2900-4398/\">Monroe also stars in one of the best horror movies of 2022</a>, The Watcher.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Labyrinth</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4058471-4.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>You remind me of the babe! This ridiculously good Jim Henson movie stars--of all people--David Bowie as the king of the goblins in an adventure in which a 16-year-old girl (Jennifer Connelly) journeys into the goblin world to save her baby brother from being turned into a goblin, himself.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. The Mist</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4058472-5.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Based on the works of Stephen King, Thomas Jane stars as an artist living in Maine, and after a storm knocks the power goes out, he heads with neighbor to the grocery store. A mist rolls into town, and anyone who gets caught up in it gets killed by mysterious monsters. Inside the grocery store, it isn't much better.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Paddington</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4058473-6.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Everyone on the planet should be offended that this movie isn't available on the ad tier of Netflix. The story of the little bear from deepest, darkest Peru finding a new home in London is one of the most positive and joyful movie you can possibly imagine. Between this and the fact that Paddington 2, which is an even better film, isn't on Netflix at all, it feels like an attack.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Pineapple Express</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4058474-7.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Seth Rogen/James Franco stoner comedy is easily a classic that reunited the duo from Freaks and Geeks as they go on an adventure to save their own lives from an evil drug dealer, a crooked cop, and an inability to become actual friends.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Road House</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4058475-8.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Before the remake releases, you need to watch the original. Patrick Swayze stars as Dalton, who's a \"Cooler.\" That's essentially a bar manager/trainer/bouncer/sex machine. He's hired to clean up the bar The Double Deuce, which resides in a town where an evil rich man has an iron grip over the population. Also, the bad guy lives across the river from Dalton--like 75 feet away--and spies on him having sex. It's weird and wonderful and brilliant.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Skyfall</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4058476-9.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Yes, this is the James Bond movie where the climax is oddly similar to Home Alone's. Bond (Daniel Craig) sets booby traps up in his childhood home to take down his enemy. It's a great movie and a really fun sequence. You'll never know that, though, because it's not on the ad tier.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. Uncharted</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4058477-10.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Based on the PlayStation game of the same name, Tom Holland plays Nathan Drake, a treasure hunter, who is on the hunt to find Magellan's treasure. It's an action-packed adventure that is a ton of fun. Does it take a few libraries from the original story? Sure. But it doesn't matter as this movie is non-stop awesome-ness.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. Walking Tall</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4058478-11.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>How dare Netflix keep this Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson classic from those on the ad tier? Don't they deserve to see him team up with Jackass star Johnny Knoxville to save their tiny town from drug dealers?</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>12. Won't You Be My Neighbor?</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4058479-12.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>This documentary into the life of iconic children's TV host Fred Rogers is a must watch for anyone who grew up watching his neighborhood unfold on PBS. Likewise, if you aren't as familiar with Rogers' work, this documentary is an engaging tale of a guy who gave his life over to helping teach children the importance of kindness.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>13. Arrested Development</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4058480-13.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The beloved sitcom, which is technically a Netflix original for its final two seasons, is one of a number of shows that are simply unavailable to the ad tier, at least for now. At least there's still always money in the banana stand. If you don't understand that reference, you might want to upgrade to ad-free status so you can watch the show.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>14. Ash vs. Evil Dead</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4058481-14.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Evil Dead series is beloved by horror fans, as it helped fortify the horror/comedy genre. In 2015, Evil Dead came back as a series on Starz for three seasons that ended up being a lot of fun and the perfect way to build on the character of Ash and the mythos that surrounds him, created by Sam Raimi--who also developed this show alongside his brother Ivan. It's an Evil Dead show that truly understands Evil Dead.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>15. The Good Place</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4058482-15.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>While you might expect this hilarious show about what happens after you die to be on Peacock, given that it aired on NBC for its entire run, it's actually on Netflix. However, if you want to stream it, you'll have to subscribe to the ad-free tier of the service.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>16. House of Cards</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4058483-16.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>This political drama is a strange entry on the list, as it's one of Netflix's oldest original series. Its entire run was available exclusively on Netflix. Now, though, it won't be available to all subscribers.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>17. Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4058484-17.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Netflix's original animated series may seem geared more towards kids, but it's still a bit terrifying. Taking place during the events of Jurassic World--when all those dinosaurs break free--the series follows a group of kids just trying to survive the dino attack.</p></h3></p><br />", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-teaming-up-with-green-game-jam-to-fight-climate-change-heres-how-players-can-help/1100-6508893/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Ubisoft Is Teaming Up With Green Game Jam To Fight Climate Change--Here's How Players Can Help", "date_published": "2022-11-03 20:46:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Ubisoft has announced that it will participate in the <a href=\"https://playing4theplanet.org/green-game-jam-2022\">2022 Green Game Jam</a> hosted by <a href=\"https://playing4theplanet.org/\">Playing for the Planet Alliance</a> throughout November.

Though the mechanics and level design were familiar after having played the first one and its Whistleblower DLC, I found the setting and characters of its doomsday cult to be much more terrifying than the wandering denizens of Murkoff's nefarious asylum in the first game. Reviewing that game back in 2017, it was a rare occasion where I struggled to hit the embargo time simply because I had to will myself to deal with its horrors. <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outlast-trials/\">The Outlast Trials</a>, as best I can tell after a weekend with the beta, will never scare me to that same extent, but that might be fine.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The biggest difference between The Outlast Trials and the games that precede it is in its co-op-friendly setup. Every other Outlast experience has been a single-player experience. In The Outlast Trials, you can play alone and see all there is to see, but you'll probably get much further with a friend or three.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Outlast Trials pits players as figurative lab rats in an unethical Murkoff maze of horrors. Across several maps--to borrow a term from games usually quite unlike Outlast--teams of up to four will work together to complete a set of tasks while avoiding the monstrous enemies that lurk the halls. A quick glance at gameplay would suggest things aren't all that different. You'll still largely be shuffling through dark hallways in condemned hellholes while unbeatable villains lurk nearby hoping to maim you. But even the simple wrinkle of crouching in the dark <em>with friends</em> gives The Outlast Trials a new feeling, and the differences don't end there.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outlast-trials-isnt-what-you-expect-but-that-might-be-a-good-thing/1100-6508876/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dwarf-fortress-arrives-on-steam-with-fancy-graphics-december-6/1100-6508880/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Dwarf Fortress Arrives On Steam With Fancy Graphics December 6", "date_published": "2022-11-03 17:02:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Dwarf Fortress will arrive on Steam this December with fancy representational graphics, brand-new UI, as well as new sound design and music.</p><p>For the unfamiliar, Dwarf Fortress is a strategy game with a procedurally generated world.

It's a spectacular blockbuster, but these are the least of its achievements.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In a game where a hulking god rips all manner of creatures limb from limb, the most shocking moments aren't bathed in blood, but carried by poignant words and heartfelt emotions. They are a former God of War--known for mercilessly killing his kin--finding the words to empathize with loss; a despondent child emploring a father to break a self-destructive cycle; a moment of tenderness in the life of a boy that has the weight of the world on his shoulders.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">God of War Ragnarok's most impressive achievements are its exploration of loss and love; grief and growth; determinism and defiance. It's an astoundingly well-written game that deconstructs the mythology of Norse gods and rebuilds it as an odyssey about families. Its story isn't about the end of the world, but those that have a hand in it. They're revered as mythical gods but are characterized by deep flaws, twisted by skewed perspectives, and corrupted by questionable motivations in the same way the people they preside over are. And yet, some also have redemptive qualities. In that respect, Ragnarok's story is told from a grey area where nuances blur the line between heroes and villains; good and evil. By constantly challenging you to reconsider who they are and the factors that drive their actions, these characters remain compelling throughout.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-blood-sweat-and-tyrs/1900-6417993/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/god-of-war-ragnarok-review/2300-6459910/", "title": "God of War Ragnarok Review", "date_published": "2022-11-03 16:00:00+00:00", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1568/15687785/4058059-review_gowr_site.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> Sony Santa Monica brings back what made the original God of War reboot great and delivers another fantastic story with exceptional writing.", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forspoken-powerful-magic-will-let-you-unleash-devastating-elemental-firepower/1100-6508874/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Forspoken's Powerful Magic Will Let You Unleash Devastating Elemental Firepower", "date_published": "2022-11-03 15:46:00+00:00", "description": "<p>The magical world of Athia is a dangerous one in Forspoken, but fortunately, protagonist Frey has plenty of magical firepower that she can wield when she's confronted by corrupted beasts and people.

A few weapons will be getting buffs to encourage players to use them more, while overperforming weapons will see small nerfs--here's what's changing.</p><p>Community manager Unyshek explains in the <a href=\"https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/sandbox-balance-updates-winter-update\">blog post</a> that 343 has started looking at weapon balance in Halo Infinite's sandbox now that players are a little more familiar with the gameplay. Looking at both player feedback and hard data on how weapons are getting used in game, six of Halo Infinite's weapons are getting tweaked for better or for worse.</p><p>The Plasma Pistol and Disruptor are both getting upgrades that 343 hopes will increase their use and effectiveness in game, while the Pulse Carbine and VK78 Commando have both been tweaked to increase effectiveness at shorter ranges. In line for a nerf this update are both the BR75 and Frag Grenade, which will be getting minor downgrades in the interest of competitiveness.
