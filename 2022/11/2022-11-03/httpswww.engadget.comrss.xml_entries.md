<p>Now that AMD has unveiled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-rdna3-gpu-radeon-7900-xtx-7900-xt-202134224.html">Radeon RX 7900 GPUs</a> that can output 8K video at high refresh rates, gamers will need displays that can handle them — and Samsung is happy to oblige. The company has <a href="https://youtu.be/hhwd6UgGVk4?t=1992">teased</a> a new generation of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-price-pre-order-020000540.html">Odyssey Neo G9</a> that will supposedly be the first 8K ultrawide gaming monitor. You won't see a full launch until CES in January, but you'll need a DisplayPort 2.1-capable video card to help that screen reach its potential. We'd also add that AMD bills the 8K as "horizontal only," so you may not get as many vertical pixels as you might like.</p><p>Other high-res DisplayPort 2.1 monitors are coming from Acer, ASUS, Dell and LG starting in early 2023. AMD unfortunately didn't share more details.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="02e8bf3414e240bb898ef46e12e66633"></div><p>This will likely be an expensive monitor when the previous-gen Odyssey Neo G9 currently sells for $2,200 with 'just' a 5,120 x 1,440 resolution and a 240Hz refresh rate. However, the bigger cost may be the PC attached to that 8K panel. On top of one of the new Radeons, you'll need a CPU that won't create a bottleneck for the graphics hardware.</p><p>There's also the question of content. Even many recent games can struggle at 8K, and older titles won't benefit much. Do you really need to play <em>CS:GO</em> at that resolution? AMD has promised that some games will run well on its cards with the help of upscaling, such as <em>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</em>, <em>Death Stranding</em>, <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> and <em>Uncharted</em>, but it's not clear how well native 8K will perform just yet. Samsung's monitor may be more of an investment in the future than instant gratification.</p>

Today, the company announced the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and RX 7900 XT, two confusingly named GPUs powered by its new RDNA3 architecture. On stage during its Las Vegas launch event, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su claimed the new hardware offers a 54 percent increase in performance per watt over the previous GPUs.

<p>Amazon is joining the ranks of tech companies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-hiring-freeze-restructuring-layoffs-184811966.html">freezing their recruitment plans</a>. Engadget has obtained a memo from Senior VP Beth Galetti (since <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/a-note-about-hiring-from-beth-galetti">published</a>) revealing that the company will "pause" hiring at its corporate offices for a few months. The internet giant will still replace departing employees and hire new people in "targeted places," Galetti wrote but there won't be any significant expansion in the near future.</p><p>As with other companies, Amazon attributed its freeze decision to an "unusual macro-economic environment." The firm doesn't want to spend too much money growing its workforce in difficult financial conditions, to put it another way. Galetti added that Amazon still wants to hire a "meaningful number" of corporate workers in 2023, but that the online shopping giant will track the economy and adjust as it "makes sense."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon had no further comment. It hired aggressively during the height of the pandemic to keep up with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-q1-2021-210221698.html">spike in online sales</a>, but ran into trouble this year due to both a return to in-person shopping and mounting costs. The company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220727006066/en/">posted</a> a $2 billion loss during its second quarter (April through June) and cut 99,000 jobs, many of them warehouse workers. It also cancelled the launch of some facilities. In early October, it temporarily <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/technology/amazon-freezes-corporate-hiring.html">halted</a> corporate hires for its retail business.</p><p>The pause comes weeks after Meta reportedly suspended all hiring, and months after big names like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-recruiter-layoffs-145900949.html">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-slows-hiring-and-tells-staff-to-be-more-entrepreneurial-103505938.html">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-first-chip-maker-to-announce-a-slowdown-in-hiring-072201920.html">NVIDIA</a> have slowed their pursuits.

<p>By the time you read this article, Netflix will have started rolling out its new “Basic with Ads” plan. After years of resisting investor pressure, the company, following its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-loses-subscribers-q1-2022-earnings-204534571.html">first subscriber decline in a decade</a>, announced this <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-ad-supported-subscription-tiers-045053725.html">past April</a> it would begin offering an ad-supported tier. Here's everything you need to know about the company's latest offering.</p><h2>How is Basic with Ads different from other Netflix plans?</h2><h2></h2><p>Besides featuring ads (more on that in a moment), the tier will limit you to streaming content at 720p. Additionally, you won’t be able to watch every title in Netflix’s library, and you won’t be able to download shows and films for offline viewing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>How much does the plan cost?</h2><h2></h2><p>In the US, Basic with Ads is priced at $7 per month.</p><h2>How many ads will I see?</h2><h2></h2><p>According to Netflix, Basic with Ads subscribers can expect to see an average of four to five minutes of advertisements per hour of content. Initially, the company plans to play spots that are between 15 and 30 seconds long, though you’ll see them both before and during shows and films. The company will employ “broad” targeting, using criteria like your country and genre preference to inform the ads it shows you</p><h2>Where is the plan available?</h2><h2></h2><p>Starting this week, the Basic with Ads plan is available in 12 countries: the US, UK, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and Spain. The company expects to launch the tier in more countries over time.&nbsp;</p><h2>How do I switch to the new plan?</h2><h2></h2><p>On either your computer or phone, visit the <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix website</a> and sign into your existing account. Click or tap on “Account,” and then “Change plan.” There, you’ll see the option to select from any one of the company’s four currently available tiers. Once you confirm you want to switch to the Basic with Ads plan, Netflix will move you over to it at the start of your next billing cycle.</p>

<p>If you're an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple%20tv/"><ins>Apple TV</ins></a> user who was considering switching to <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/netflix"><ins>Netflix's</ins></a> new ad-supported plan, it might be best to hold off for now. The more budget-friendly version of the service (the "Basic with ads" tier) currently isn't supported on Apple TV devices, including the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-review-2022-faster-cheaper-best-streaming-box-150013627.html">Apple TV 4K</a> unit.</p><p>“Basic with ads plan support on tvOS is not available at launch but coming soon," Netflix told <a href="https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/netflix-basic-with-ads-plan-apple-tv-1235422305/"><em><ins>Variety</ins></em></a>. As spotted by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/11/03/netflix-with-ads-apple-tv/"><em><ins>9to5Mac</ins></em></a>, a<a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/127864"><ins> Netflix support page</ins></a> notes that you'll only be able to watch Netflix on Apple TV if you're subscribed to the Basic, Standard or Premium tiers. Otherwise, you'll need to access Netflix through a different device.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Netflix didn't explain why the Basic with ads plan doesn't work on Apple TV as yet, but it seems a bit of an oversight. It originally planned to start offering that $7 per month tier in early 2023, but it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-basic-with-ads-price-release-date-174526317.html"><ins>moved the timeline up to this month</ins></a>. It wanted to get out of the gate before Disney+ <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-price-increase-ad-based-service-204903273.html"><ins>launches its ad-supported plan in December</ins></a>.</p><p>As of today, Netflix's ad-supported plan is live in the UK, UK, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and Spain. It became available in Canada and Mexico on Tuesday. Beyond the inclusion of ads, the plan has some other downgrades from Netflix's higher tiers, such as video resolution maxing out at 720p (the same as the ad-free Basic plan), some content being unavailable and a lack of offline viewing.</p>

## Hey T-Mobile, nobody wants your suitcase

<p>Have you ever wanted to use your luggage as a workstation? No? Don't tell T-Mobile that, then. The provider and Samsara have <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221102006253/en/Introducing-the-Un-carrier-On-from-T-Mobile-%E2%80%93-the-Smartest-Flyest-Carry-On-Ever">unveiled</a> a smart carry-on suitcase, the "Un-carrier On" (sorry about the pun), whose stand-out feature is the ability to double as a desk. Like a handful of other bag makers, T-Mobile thinks you'll rest your laptop on your baggage while you finish a must-send work email. That strikes us as potentially uncomfortable if the case sits on your lap, especially if you have to stare at T-Mobile's eye-searing magenta — did we mention that's the only color option?</p><p>There are some practical features. T-Mobile claims this is the only carry-on suitcase with wireless charging for your phone, and there's USB-C charging if you prefer cables. You can track the case when it invariably gets sent to the wrong airport, and an eight-bag packing set (with conspicuous T-Mobile branding, of course) keeps your toothpaste safely away from your shirts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ef0d16547d4e4456b0026b6353584486"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The limited edition Un-carrier On will ship later in November, or just in time for that Thanksgiving family visit you may or may not be dreading. However, the scariest part is the price — T-Mobile is asking $325. That's a lot to pay for a carrier promo on wheels, even if the functionality might come in handy at the gate. You might want to slip an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faa-apple-airtags-allowed-in-checked-baggage-181915494.html">item tracker</a> into a conventional carry-on instead.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/3-d-printed-functional-heart-piece-191938833.html">Bioprinted body parts</a> could prove vital to future medical treatments, and scientists are going to great lengths to test it — in a very literal sense. NASA, Redwire and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences Center for Biotechnology (4DBio3) are sending a new 3D printer to the International Space Station, Redwire's BioFabrication Facility, to bioprint a human knee meniscus in orbit and study the result on Earth. Ideally, this will lead to treatments for the meniscal injuries that US soldiers all-too-frequently face.</p><p>Redwire hopes to 3D print whole organs in space, although it characterizes this as a "long-term" goal. The company is also using NASA's Advanced Plant Habitat for a project to identify genes for space-friendly plants. Another investigation will use a NASA furnace to create and demo passive cooling for electronics in low gravity.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The BFF printer will fly to the ISS aboard a supply rocket launching as soon as November 6th from NASA's Wallops Island spaceport. The mission will carry three extra payloads.</p><p>This isn't NASA's first spaceborne 3D printer. Last year, NASA carried a Redwire printer to the ISS to demonstrate <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-3d-printer-moon-regolith-iss-215332227.html">printing lunar soil</a>. That technology could one day help Moon colonists build habitats without carrying an abundance of supplies from Earth. The bioprinter is more immediately practical, of course. If the research pans out, doctors could replace damaged body parts without resorting to donations or inorganic implants.</p>

## Steam for ChromeOS works on more devices and is easier to install

<p>It's already been almost eight months since Google and Valve announced that they were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-chrome-os-alpha-160051496.html">jointly working on a version of Steam for ChromeOS</a>, something that would greatly expand the gaming options available on Chromebooks. While it was an alpha release, limited to only a handful of devices, I was surprised at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-for-chromebooks-alpha-preview-174030567.html">how decent the experience was</a> — even the most powerful Chromebooks aren't going to be able to run cutting-edge titles, but there is plenty in the Steam catalog that's worth playing.&nbsp;</p><p>As of today, more people can get in on the fun: Google and Valve have <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://chromeos.dev/en/posts/steam-on-chromeos-beta__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!ClKKc06Lp5XBwuR--PzU4lMI6bpGlrjh47X-_qTqF7gbsZfwmOFI1mTQJzrAbBOjtUyoldL0wdy7QHY$">announced</a> that Steam for ChromeOS has graduated to beta. This means a handful of things have changed; one of the most notable updates is that you don't have to switch your Chromebook to run on the experimental and less stable. Dev channel. Instead, you can run your device on the Beta release channel; obviously, that's still not something you might want to do with a computer you rely on for everyday work, but the beta ChromeOS releases are typically pretty stable.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another big change is broader hardware support. The beta now works with Chromebooks running AMD Ryzen 5000 C-Series and Intel 12th-gen Core processors; the supported device list now includes 20 models, up from only seven before. In addition to supporting those newer chips, Steam also works with Core i3 and Ryzen 3 processors. Google still warns that an i5 or Ryzen 5 chip with 16GB of RAM is recommended — but eventually opening things up to the many Chromebooks with i3 processors could be good for people playing older or less demanding games.</p><p>Google has also made a few user experience changes. One basic one is letting the low battery notification appear when you're playing a full-screen game so your computer doesn't die unexpectedly. A more complicated change involves how Steam manages storage in ChromeOS — previously, games would simply reserve the amount of space needed based on the reported requirement on Steam. But games that needed to download content from outside of Steam were unable to access the storage they need. Google and Valve say they completely reworked how Steam figures out what storage it needs, a process that led to some additional benefits — like improved file access for games that use the Proton compatibility tool.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, there are a number of noteworthy performance and compatibility updates. Steam for ChromeOS now works with the widely-used DirectX 12 and Vulkan 1.3 graphics libraries, and Google says that battery life when running games has been improved thanks to reduced CPU overhead when running titles using DirectX or Vulkan. Google also fixed some issues with high-resolution displays — even if games were running at a lower resolution, Chromebooks with screens that ran at QHD or UHD resolutions could suffer serious performance hits. Fortunately, that should no longer be the case.</p><p>If you're up for running your Chromebook on the beta channel, you can get started with these new Steam features today. <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://g.co/SteamOnChromeOS__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!GGOJgtKMWtN7u0Qx9z8iR0AMeI_8YqhWXEjIzLlQM2nUQkOVRf2dmcaNNEO9bVtq-d0DuG66aA-Y3Qw$">Google's Chromium site</a> has everything you'll need to try it out, including a list of the new supported devices, recommended games and known issues to watch out for.&nbsp;</p>

A few weeks later, an Ubisoft executive claimed players would benefit from having a marketplace where they could buy and sell NFTs of in-game items, "but they <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-nft-executive-response-155250977.html"><ins>don't get it</ins></a> for now." In April, Ubisoft announced that the game <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ghost-recon-breakpoint-updates-ubisoft-nfts-142920408.html"><ins>wouldn't receive any more content updates</ins></a>, effectively putting the game on ice and diminishing whatever value <em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em>'s NFTs had.</p><p>It seems Square Enix is facing an uphill battle to make <em>Symbiogenesis </em>a success.

## WiFi security flaw lets a drone track devices through walls

<p>WiFi's friendliness to other devices might pose a significant threat in the wrong circumstances. University of Waterloo researchers have <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/media/waterloo-researchers-discover-security-loophole-allowing">discovered</a> a security flaw in the networking standard that lets attackers track devices through walls. The technique identifies the location of a device within 3.3ft just by exploiting WiFi devices' automatic contact responses (even on password-protected networks) and measuring the response times. You can identify all the connected hardware in a room, and even track people's movements if they have a phone or smartwatch.</p><p>The scientists tested the exploit by modifying an off-the-shelf drone to create a flying scanning device, the Wi-Peep. The robotic aircraft sends several messages to each device as it flies around, establishing the positions of devices in each room. A thief using the drone could find vulnerable areas in a home or office by checking for the absence of security cameras and other signs that a room is monitored or occupied. It could also be used to follow a security guard, or even to help rival hotels spy on each other by gauging the number of rooms in use.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There have been attempts to exploit similar WiFi problems before, but the team says these typically require bulky and costly devices that would give away attempts. Wi-Peep only requires a small drone and about $15 US in equipment that includes two WiFi modules and a voltage regulator. An intruder could quickly scan a building without revealing their presence.</p><p>Research lead Dr. Ali Abedi is calling for changes to the WiFi standard to prevent devices from responding to "strangers." That may take years, however, and Abedi suggests that hardware makers address the issue in the meantime by introducing randomized response times. The chances of burglars using drones to map your home devices aren't high at this stage (they'd still need the know-how), but there are things developers can do to thwart these aerial spying efforts.</p>

## Apple TV 4K review (2022): Still the best streaming box by a long shot

<p>After Apple <em>finally</em> gave us <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-review-2021-new-siri-remote-150054255.html">a decent Siri remote last year</a>, I couldn't imagine the Apple TV 4K getting much better. It's not like anyone is clamoring for an 8K upgrade – all we need these days is support for fast 4K streaming, as well as the multitude of HDR (high definition range) formats out there. The new Apple TV 4K can easily meet those demands, but what's truly impressive is that it's far faster than before <em>and </em>it's a lot cheaper at $129 (down from $179)! At last, there's an Apple TV I can recommend to anyone without hesitation.</p><p>Let's start with what's new: this year's Apple TV 4K is powered by an A15 Bionic chip, which launched with the iPhone 13 (and is still being used in the iPhone 14). That's a huge leap forward from the 2018-era A12 in the previous model. The new box also ships with 64GB of storage, instead of a meager 32GB. If you're planning to load up a ton of games and apps, there's also a 128GB model for $149, which adds an Ethernet port and support for the Thread internet-of-things protocol. Finally, Apple has integrated HDR10+ support, which works similar to Dolby Vision for delivering more accurate HDR in every scene.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At first glance, the Apple TV 4K looks the same as the previous models: a smooth black box with obscenely rounded corners. Peer a bit closer, though, and you'll notice it's actually smaller, like a prop rendering of its predecessor. Apple says it has 20 percent less volume than before, a result of losing the fan from previous models (this one runs silently) and being powered by more efficient hardware. Apple wouldn't say what, exactly, led to the dramatic price drop. But I'd bet it's down to simpler manufacturing, as well as a dip in component pricing across the board.</p><p>If you want to hear me wax poetic about Apple's Siri Remote, just check out my review of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-review-2021-new-siri-remote-150054255.html">last Apple TV</a>. I'm still enamored with it a year later: It's easy to hold, has all of the basic functions you'd want, and it's far harder to lose than the previous super-thin remote. I'm still baffled why we were forced to use a glass-backed remote with a crummy touchpad on the original Apple TV 4K. Long live the new model and it's touch-sensitive, directional clickpad.</p><figure><img alt="Apple TV 4K (2022)" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/b92976f0-5b7f-11ed-b95d-6d632e4f30c8" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>So sure, the hardware is great, but how's the software? Setting up the Apple TV 4K is now surprisingly easy, assuming you're already beholden to Apple's ecosystem. After plugging it in, I just had to tap my iPhone to the box to send over my WiFi and iCloud credentials. I chose to synchronize my home screens, which made all of the apps from my current Apple TV pop over. At that point, all I had to do was log into my usual streaming haunts, and I was ready to go.</p><p>After using every Apple TV the company has put out over the last decade, I had one immediate thought as I started using this new model: Holy hell this thing is fast. That's not to say the last version was slow, by any means. But there's a snappiness to this year's box that just feels freeing. I can swipe through all of the apps on my homescreen with ease, launch Netflix a few seconds faster than before, and drill through my library of movies without breaking a sweat. No more slight loading delays or pinwheels.</p><p>It could just be that I'm experiencing the rush of a brand new device, one uncluttered by a year's worth of use. But using the new Apple TV 4K feels like the difference between using an iPhone X and an iPhone 14 — everything just happens <em>faster</em>, with a greater sense of urgency. I found that most useful when I was flipping between apps and different videos. While I was catching up on <em>Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities</em> on Netflix, I could quickly hop over to check out my YouTube channels while my wife needed a bathroom break, and then resume the creepiness when she returned. Again, this is something I did frequently with the previous box, but now the Apple TV feels completely unencumbered.</p><section><img alt="Apple TV 4K (2022)" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/b8f8a2f0-5b7f-11ed-83b9-691de02abb5e" /></section><p>Amid my speed viewing, I was also impressed to see that the Apple TV handles HDR 10+ without any issues. The opening chase in <em>No Time to Die</em> looked glorious, with excellent highlights in the brightly-lit European streets, but also solid shadow detail in darker scenes. That's the main appeal of HDR10+. Like the original HDR 10 standard, it delivers both brighter brights and darker darks. <em>But</em>, it can also adjust those settings based on the scene you're viewing, just like Dolby Vision. That avoids some issues commonly seen with HDR 10, where one HDR profile setting may not work well across a wide variety of scenes.</p><p>While testing the Apple TV 4K on Samsung's 55-inch Odyssey Ark monitor, I was also able to view Dolby Vision titles from iTunes via HDR10+. That feature is particularly useful on the Ark, since it doesn't support Dolby Vision on its own. You can expect HDR10+ to work across Apple TV+ offerings, as well as many titles available for rent or purchase. Amazon has also been pushing the standard for years, so you'll find native HDR10+ support across all of its originals. (It looked particularly great during the opening of <em>The Peripheral.)</em></p><p>If you weren't a fan of the Apple TV's interface before, this new model won't change your mind. But as someone who has tested <em>plenty</em> of streaming devices, I still feel most at home with the Apple TV. I appreciate its wide variety of apps, its seamless integration with iOS devices, and the overall polish you don't see on Roku's software. Sure, you can use the Apple TV app on competing devices today (including Roku's!), but that's just a gateway to content. It's not the same as living with an elegantly designed streaming interface day-to-day.</p><figure><img alt="Apple TV 4K (2022)" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/b965e3b0-5b7f-11ed-beec-eee373fb9690" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Another plus? The Apple TV actually has games you may want to play .I was able to load up Sonic Racing in a few seconds, pair an Xbox controller, and start zooming around the track without much issue. The A15 Bionic should allow for smoother performance on more demanding games, but I've personally never seen anything stress these boxes much.</p><p>Perhaps my favorite aspect of the Apple TV this year: you don't have to pay as much of a premium to own it. At $129, it's a bit pricier than the $100 Roku Ultra, but in exchange you get a far more robust app platform and more features. The $149 model we reviewed is a smarter buy if you demand Ethernet, or would like to start using Thread IoT devices. (I didn't have any Thread-compatible hardware to test, unfortunately.) But even that model is a decent bit cheaper than the previous $179 Apple TV.</p><p>If you already bought last year's Apple TV 4K for its new Siri remote, this new box probably isn't worth the upgrade. But if you picked up an HDR10+ TV recently, it may be worth the step up, just so you're seeing the best HDR picture possible.</p><p>It’s taken a while, but Apple has finally managed to craft the ideal streaming box: one that’s relatively inexpensive, filled with modern features and fast. <em>So damn fast</em>.</p>

## Amazon will bring Matter smart home support to 17 devices this year

<p>Amazon was quick to pledge support for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/matter-smart-home-standard-released-160059101.html">Matter smart home standard</a>, and now it's clear just when (and if) you can expect the technology to reach your household. The company has confirmed that 17 Echo devices, plugs, switches and bulbs will support Matter over WiFi in December, with 30 Echo and Eero products offering support by early next year. You'll initially need Android to set this up (Apple only released the Matter-friendly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macos-venture-ipados-16-ios-161-updates-170844000.html">iOS 16.1</a> days ago), and the focus will be on lighting. However, support for iOS, Thread and more smart home tech is also due in early 2023.</p><p>The support will extend to years-old Echo products. While we don't yet have a full compatibility list as of this writing (we've asked for details), older speakers like the second-generation Echo Plus (shown here) will be included. You might not have to replace your equipment just to be sure you're ready for Matter.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You won't have to be too picky about which phones and apps you use. Amazon is partnering with Samsung to let you use Alexa or SmartThings to set up Matter hardware. An upcoming Alexa framework will create a simple, unified Thread network that allows control through either company's platforms.</p><p>Accordingly, Amazon is tweaking its Works with Alexa (WWA) certifications to add Matter support. A new device that receives the WWA badge will have to support Matter. Existing hardware that gets a Matter update won't need to go through the program again, although it will need to pass Matter certification and will still have to meet Amazon's WWA requirements.</p><p>This still leaves you with the prospect of replacing particularly old Echo gear, and there's a chance some of your connected home components won't support Matter at all. However, Amazon's compatibility plans suggest you won't have to overhaul your entire setup.</p>

And there’s never been a better time to own a new camera, as the latest technology will let them take better photos and video than ever. It can be difficult to know where to start, though, with all the camera models out there, let alone the numerous accessories like backpacks, memory cards, tripods and more. Fortunately, we’ve done all the research and found cameras at a wide range of prices, along with accessories that will help your giftee get the most out of their gear.</p><h2>Canon EOS R10</h2><figure><img alt="Canon EOS R10" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/7efae550-5467-11ed-b0fd-7221a6e86127" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>Though it just came out, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0eee6f60-6f21-4ba6-b70e-cc15b39bf860&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Adorama&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZWVlNmY2MC02ZjIxLTRiYTYtYjcwZS1jYzE1YjM5YmY4NjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWRvcmFtYS5jb20vY2FyMTAuaHRtbD8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjY1ZTI1MmUyLTNlNjktMzRiYi04Yjk1LTFkODI2OWFhNTgzNSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQRhE4Z3NHCymicMg5MDlT_S-OZUBpou5ZxudqGEl4Gh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fcar10.html%3F">Canon’s EOS R10</a> is near the top of the list for desirable camera gifts, thanks to a mix of great handling and strong performance.

It now comes with a 27-megapixel sensor, offering a significant bump over the previous 23-megapixel chip. With that, you get the highest resolution video of any action camera (5K 60p and 4K 120p), with 10-bit color across the board. It also has a faster f/1.9 aperture. The higher resolution enables the horizon-leveling feature that keeps things steady when the camera tilts, on top of GoPro’s class-leading HyperSmooth stabilization, now in its fifth generation. You probably don’t need to update if you’re coming from a Hero 9 or 10, but it’s far and away the best option otherwise.</p><a class="athena-button rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwQjk2SDdMR1gvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTJ4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2NWUyNTJlMi0zZTY5LTM0YmItOGI5NS0xZDgyNjlhYTU4MzUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdZXPrtioW6Kl1OXIXTs--wgreMFzJgg5WeYCuRfwvNy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0B96H7LGX%2F" id="abc4acc1e6d3421aa6cc4e60900cdbe1">Buy GoPro Hero 11 at Amazon - $500</a><h2>Sony A7 IV</h2><figure><img alt="Sony A7 IV" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/aa9130c0-5467-11ed-bbef-c3343b183ef4" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0eee6f60-6f21-4ba6-b70e-cc15b39bf860&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Adorama&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZWVlNmY2MC02ZjIxLTRiYTYtYjcwZS1jYzE1YjM5YmY4NjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWRvcmFtYS5jb20vaXNvYTdtNC5odG1sPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjVlMjUyZTItM2U2OS0zNGJiLThiOTUtMWQ4MjY5YWE1ODM1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAdk3crsF_h3pIFUGnKAw77_7KuTyIeOBUf-zKKbJcDE0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fisoa7m4.html%3F">Sony’s A7 IV</a> is a follow up to the immensely popular A7 III, and would be guaranteed to please any photographer for Christmas.

## Patreon finally adds native video to its membership platform

<p>Patreon has <a href="https://blog.patreon.com/introducing-patreon-video">launched a native video hosting service</a> and is giving Pro and Premium creators early access to the feature, so they no longer have to use YouTube to share video content with their fans. The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/patreon-video-hosting-player-183028774.html">first revealed</a> that it was working on a video hosting platform and player of its own last year. Now, Patreon has started rolling it out to more users after a period of beta testing. Company CPO Julian Gutman told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/03/patreon-adds-a-long-awaited-native-video-feature/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> that Patreon has seen creators "use it quite successfully to grow their memberships" during the beta and that it's "really excited to scale it out."</p><p>Creators typically have to use YouTube, Vimeo and similar websites if videos are part of what they offer to fans. They can also attach files for download on their Patreon posts, but that doesn't offer a seamless experience, and those files are limited to 200MB in size. Creators who get early access to the feature will be able to upload HD videos directly to Patreon and will be able to easily create previews to tease their content to potential subscribers. They can control how long the previews are, simply by highlighting frames in the backend during upload. And since fans will be paying for full access to those videos, they won't encounter any ads while watching.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="e0d65329ed7b4e52a87b8ba543e23d6b"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p><em>TechCrunch</em> says Patreon Video will be available on desktop, iOS and Android. It will support AirPlay for Apple devices at launch, while Patreon's Android app will get Chromecast support "soon." The feature is free to use at the moment, and creators on Pro and Premium plans will be able to upload 500 hours of videos until the end of 2023 at no extra cost. Patreon will eventually charge them to use the feature, though: It plans to introduce pricing, which takes into account the cost of hosting and streaming video natively, after 2023. Creators will have six months to use up their 500 hours once pricing is in place. Any video they upload during early access will remain accessible on the website, and they won't have to pay anything to keep them there.</p>

## The Morning After: A look at Canon’s new R6-II

<p>Canon’s EOS R6 was a great camera with one fatal flaw: It couldn’t hold its temperature, so it overheated fairly regularly. Two years later, Canon has released a successor that should help restore its reputation after such a high-profile error. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r6-mark-ii-hands-on-040031374.html">The EOS R6 Mark II</a> gets a higher resolution 24.2-megapixel sensor, faster shooting speeds and better low-light performance.</p><p>Steve Dent spent some time shooting with some R6-II prototypes and has plenty to say in his detailed write up. Canon has eliminated many of the thermal issues, improved the efficiency and lengthened the time you can shoot 4K video in a single burst. There’s loads more to read and get excited by in his write-up, which has clearly got plenty of camera fans excited for its launch later this year.</p><p>– Dan Cooper</p><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html">The best laptops for 2022 </a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-x-t5-camera-price-release-date-141508004.html">The X-T5 is the first major upgrade to Fujifilm’s compact camera flagship in 5 years</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-elon-musk-bought-and-took-over-twitter-180045278.html">How Elon Musk bought and took over Twitter</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-hangouts-is-well-and-truly-dead-052557495.html">Google Hangouts is well and truly dead</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-shutting-down-dedicated-street-view-app-102514292.html">Google is shutting down its dedicated Street View app </a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/former-apple-employee-admits-defrauding-the-company-out-of-17-million-154208844.html">Former Apple employee admits to defrauding the company out of $17 million</a></p></li></ul><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps-vr-2-release-date-price-virtual-reality-ps5-135402382.html">PS VR2 arrives on February 22nd, and it costs a whopping $550</a></h2><h3>Yes, that is more than the current retail price of a PlayStation 5.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps-vr-2-release-date-price-virtual-reality-ps5-135402382.html"><figure><img alt="Promotional Image of Sony's PlayStation VR 2" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/3f9a2530-5b63-11ed-b3df-3c00282ddd68" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure></a><p>Sony has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps-vr-2-release-date-price-virtual-reality-ps5-135402382.html">announced its next-generation VR headset</a>, PS VR2, will debut on February 22nd, 2023.

## WhatsApp's new Communities feature aims to bring related group chats together

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/whatsapp/"><ins>WhatsApp</ins></a> is rolling out some new features, including one that's designed to bring related group chats together. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-communities-group-chats-150248053.html"><ins>announced the Communities feature earlier this year</ins></a>, and the aim is to allow users to combine group chats “under one umbrella with a structure that works for them.” Similar tools are in the works for Instagram and Facebook.</p><p>Communities will be available to all WhatsApp users in the coming months. You'll be able to set up smaller group chats within a community to discuss things that matter to you and switch between them with ease. WhatsApp will offer admins "powerful new tools" to manage communities, such as the ability to broadcast announcements to all members and being able to choose which groups to include.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="WhatsApp Communities" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/0bfb57c0-5ae7-11ed-bcfb-1dc93efef291" style="height: 1080; width: 1920;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">WhatsApp</div></figure><p>WhatsApp suggests that neighborhoods, workplaces and parents who have kids at the same school might bring groups together as part of a community. You can tap the Communities tab at the top of the Android app or the bottom of the screen on iOS to get started. You'll be able to start a community from the ground up or add existing groups to it.</p><p>The Communities feature sounds a bit like Facebook Groups (it bears similarities to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/nextdoor/">Nextdoor</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/discord/"><ins>Discord</ins></a> too) albeit with the protection of end-to-end encryption. While Zuckerberg has been eyeing a community-driven model to reduce the emphasis on feeds across Meta's apps, there may be some negatives to making group chats act more like Facebook Groups, where <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-gives-group-admins-new-tools-to-block-misinformation-170034622.html"><ins>misinformation</ins></a> has proliferated in recent years. In general, WhatsApp has fewer moderation tools due to the platform's focus on encryption, which may make it more difficult to keep a lid on falsehoods.</p><p>Elsewhere, WhatsApp is adding some new features to groups, even ones that aren't linked to a community. Polls are coming to groups, as is support for encrypted 32-person video calls, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-call-links-group-video-calls-meta-154503871.html"><ins>Meta has been testing for the last several weeks</ins></a>.

## Elon Musk is reportedly planning to cut Twitter's workforce in half
 - [https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-50-percent-layoffs-031228046.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-50-percent-layoffs-031228046.html?src=rss)

<p>The mass layoffs Twitter employees have been bracing for since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html">Elon Musk began his takeover</a> may be on the horizon. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-02/musk-plans-to-eliminate-half-of-twitter-jobs-in-cost-cut-drive?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the website's new owner and "Chief Twit" is planning to cull 3,700 employees from the company's workforce, which would cut its number of staff members in half, in an effort to cut costs. Musk and a team of advisers are still reportedly in the midst of finalizing the terms for the layoffs, but one option they're considering is offering the people they let go 60 days' of severance pay. The executive could break the news to affected staffers as soon as Friday.&nbsp;</p><p>Those who get to keep their jobs may have to get used to working from the office again. <em>Bloomberg</em> says Musk is also planning to end Twitter's work-from-anywhere policy and asking employees to report to offices, barring some exceptions. The publication previously reported that Twitter employees had been worried about the changes Musk could bring when it comes to this particular policy before he even took over. It's no secret that the executive isn't a fan of work-from-home arrangements and had previously given Tesla and SpaceX employees <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-tells-space-x-and-tesla-workers-that-they-must-return-to-the-office-full-time-223747961.html">an ultimatum</a>, demanding that they spend 40 hours in the office or leave the company.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Before Musk's takeover of the social network started, reports came out that he was going to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-reportedly-wants-to-lay-off-most-of-twitters-employees-222504933.html">axe 75 percent</a> of the company's staff members. He reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-wont-layoff-75-percent-of-staff-122948434.html">denied</a> those numbers when he visited Twitter's San Francisco HQ, but it was pretty clear that layoffs were still in the cards. After the deal to purchase Twitter was sealed, Musk's first move was to fire former CEO Parag Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal and other top execs.&nbsp;</p><p>More director and VP jobs were let go over the weekend, while some remaining Twitter employees in leadership roles were asked to write up lists of staff members that can be cut. Those layoff lists were reportedly ranked based on each individual's contribution to Twitter's code, and Musk asked help from Tesla's directors and engineers to assess them.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from ordering a mass layoff to save money, Musk is also implementing huge changes to make money, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-price-increasing-8-per-month-180319987.html">raising the price</a> of Twitter Blue to $8 a month from $3. <em>Bloomberg</em> says the new pricing could go <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-02/musk-to-begin-charging-for-twitter-verification-as-soon-as-monday?sref=10lNAhZ9">live as soon as Monday</a> next week. The subscription will also be a requirement for blue verification badges going forward, though users who are already verified will be given months to start paying before they lose their check mark.&nbsp;</p>

## Twitter cancels Chirp developer conference two weeks before it was scheduled to begin

<p>In another sign of the upheaval happening internally at Twitter, the company has called off its Chirp <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-chirp-developer-conference-215011836.html"><ins>developer conference</ins></a> just two weeks before it was scheduled to take place on November 16th. The company alerted developers and other attendees in a brief note that didn’t provide a reason for the cancellation.</p><p>“The team at Twitter is hard at work right now to make Twitter better for everyone - including developers,” the message says. “While we are heads down working on some exciting things for you, we’ve decided to cancel our #Chirp Developer Conference.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment on the reason for the cancellation. Members of the media received invitations to register for Chirp just two weeks ago. “Chirp is the first time we will bring our developer community from around the globe together in person to preview some new tools, discuss feedback, and celebrate the developers that are making it easier for people on Twitter to discover content, have safer conversations, and impact the greater good,” a Twitter spokesperson said at the time.</p><div id="062e49ddbbfd45bab534d1127fad6210"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We’re currently hard at work to make Twitter better for everyone, including developers! We’ve decided to cancel the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Chirp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Chirp</a> developer conference while we build some things that we’re excited to share with you soon.</p>— Twitter Dev (@TwitterDev) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1587946525245816832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>While sudden, the cancellation isn’t particularly shocking, given Musk’s recent takeover of the company. In addition to shaking up its leadership, he’s also vowed to significantly change the company’s subscription service, Twitter Blue, and is likely to make changes to content moderation and other policies. It wouldn’t be surprising if he also has a different vision for Twitter's developer strategy.</p><p>But for Twitter's developers, the cancellation will likely be a disappointment. The company has had a strained relationship with developers over the years, but has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-new-api-thirdparty-apps-201408959.html"><ins>recently</ins></a> tried to revamp its developer platform with new APIs for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-api-for-academic-research-190046995.html"><ins>researchers</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-will-recommend-third-party-apps-for-preventing-harassment-002913388.html"><ins>third-party</ins></a> apps. Chirp was set to be Twitter’s first in-person developer conference since 2015. Now, like many other aspects of Twitter under Musk, the company’s plans for developers are once again uncertain.</p>
