14:32:13+00:00", "description": "<p>Hi HN! We are Nunzio and Sebastiano, co-founders of Akiflow (<a href=\"https://akiflow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://akiflow.com</a>). Akiflow is a personal planner that consolidates all your calendars and tasks in a unified view of your work.<p>For people who like to plan their time, it is tough to be realistic about what work you can get done without a calendar showing you how much time you can invest in your tasks. But it is hard to organize this because there is so much context-switching due to tasks coming from different apps\u2014not to mention \"unstructured\" sources like email, notes taken during a meeting, a message on Slack, etc..<p>I\u2019m that type of user\u2014for me, my calendar has always been the \u2018primary source of truth\u2019. But the user experience was terrible. I had to keep to-do lists on the side of another app and manually turn my tasks into events to see them in the calendar. Tasks were scattered across messaging apps (emails, Slack), project management platforms, video calls, the web, etc., forcing me to jump between tabs, tasks and tools. I had to manually turn emails or Slack messages into tasks on Asana and always remember to push new tasks into my task lists.<p>We originally started Akiflow with a narrower idea: a command bar, similar to Alfred, to create tasks on Asana, Trello, etc.. or add events on the calendar. After a while, we learned that what our users really wanted was to have everything in one place. Once we understood that, it was obvious that we should pivot to building that one tool: a tasks+calendars app focused on making people faster.<p>How it works: most people start their day by checking outstanding conversations on their emails or Slack from mobile or desktop. There are two types of conversations\u2014those that can be answered right away (in which case just do it!), and those that generate a task. The latter are what you save into Akiflow. Once you\u2019re done processing your emails, Slack, etc., you open Akiflow where you find all your tasks coming from your various conversations and tools.<p>Once in Akiflow, you can organize each task quickly\u2014you see all your to-dos and can drag and drop them into your calendar between events already scheduled. Alternatively, you can snooze a task for later if you need more time, or snooze it for someday if it isn't actionable yet.<p>Now you have a complete list of your tasks for today and can hunker down to work. As your day goes on, Akiflow sends notifications on what you should be working on, based on your calendar events and tasks. We make this easy\u2014for example, when it is time for a call, you can join right away with a click or a shortcut.<p>We have integrations (via APIs) with multiple sources of to-dos (Gmail, Slack, Todoist, Notion, Asana, Trello, ClickUp, and anything else via Zapier and IFTTT) to consolidate tasks in a single inbox. We added a lot of keyboard shortcuts and a command bar (we had this ready from Akiflow #1) and built a desktop application that manages all this information and helps schedule it.<p>The calendar works offline and supports both events and tasks; it's built for time blocking and gives a comprehensive view of your day, week or month with features that make everyday actions much faster (join a call, share calendar availability, meet with, review your days). We integrate with your Google Calendar with a two-way sync, and we support working entirely offline. We also have a mobile app currently in beta to add and manage tasks on the go.<p>The desktop application is built using Electron and React. We use some native node modules to use a local SQLite database to store all the information and provide offline support. Our desktop app is in sync with our cloud, so multiple desktop clients will be kept in sync.<p>If you're interested in trying the product, we have a free 7 days trial available; after that, we have a basic SAAS pricing model (<a href=\"https://akiflow.com/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://akiflow.com/pricing/</a>).<p>We would love to hear your feedback and ideas\u2014thanks!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33451584\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33451584</a></p>\n<p>Points: 34</p>\n<p># Comments: 13</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://blog.whatsapp.com/communities-now-available", "title": "Communities Now Available", "date_published": "2022-11-03 14:23:42+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://blog.whatsapp.com/communities-now-available\">https://blog.whatsapp.com/communities-now-available</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33451464\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33451464</a></p>\n<p>Points: 13</p>\n<p># Comments: 8</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.alexhyett.com/one-month-on-youtube/", "title": "I Posted on YouTube Consistently for 1 Month.

We offer open-source user authentication and we just released our user roles product for companies implementing authorization.<p>Our users are web developers, and a prominent and adjacent pain point for our users is authorization. Developers typically implement two independent solutions for authentication and authorization. Offering AuthN and AuthZ in a single solution is something we\u2019ve been thinking about for the last few years.<p>Quick primer, authentication is knowing who the user is, and authorization is knowing what the user has access to. A physical analogy: A person enters a building. Authentication means reading their ID card and knowing that the person\u2019s name is John. Authorization means knowing which floors, offices, and files John has access to.<p>With increasing privacy and data complexity, companies like Netflix[1], Slack[2], and Airbnb[3] have built out their own complex authorization systems.<p>To build our user roles product, we started with a first principles approach of covering authorization use cases using scripting languages such as XACML and OPA. But looking at existing solutions built by talented teams like Oso[4], Aserto[5], Cerbos[6], Strya[7], we realized that while these were powerful solutions, they were often overkill for most early to mid-stage companies (especially on the B2C side).<p>We went back to the drawing board, reached out to our users and after dozens of conversations, we realized that most authorization needs require the ability to<p>1. Assign and manage roles and permissions<p>2. Store roles in the DB and session tokens to make it readable on the frontend and<p>3. Protect APIs and websites based on these roles and permissions.<p>And so, we built user roles \u2013 a simple RBAC authorization service that focuses on the balance between simplicity and utility. It doesn\u2019t cover many complex cases and we\u2019re not looking to displace any of the authorization incumbents. But you can add AuthN and AuthZ using a single solution, quickly.<p>In the near future, we\u2019ll be launching an admin GUI where you can manage your users and their roles with a few clicks.<p>We\u2019d love for you to try it out and hear what additional functionality you\u2019d like to see. What are your favorite authentication providers and what do they get right?<p>- [1]: <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity/vl-ca-2018/cdn.oreillystatic.com/en/assets/1/event/270/The%20distributed%20authorization%20system_%20A%20Netflix%20case%20study%20Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity/vl-ca-2018/cdn.orei...</a><p>- [2]: <a href=\"https://slack.engineering/role-management-at-slack/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://slack.engineering/role-management-at-slack/</a><p>- [3]: <a href=\"https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/himeji-a-scalable-centralized-system-for-authorization-at-airbnb-341664924574\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/himeji-a-scalable-cent...</a><p>- [4]: <a href=\"https://www.osohq.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.osohq.com/</a><p>- [5]: <a href=\"https://www.aserto.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.aserto.com/</a><p>- [6]: <a href=\"https://cerbos.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://cerbos.dev/</a><p>- [7]: <a href=\"https://www.styra.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.styra.com/</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33450860\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33450860</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/what-happened-to-signal-desktop/32119", "title": "Snap Store administrators removed signal-desktop from Ubuntu Snap", "date_published": "2022-11-03 13:42:01+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/what-happened-to-signal-desktop/32119\">https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/what-happened-to-signal-desktop/32119</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33450806\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33450806</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33450538", "title": "Ask HN: How to give back as a software engineer?", "date_published": "2022-11-03 13:21:35+00:00", "description": "<p>Hi all! I have come upon good financial fortune recently and took a step back from day-to-day work as a software engineer. After a few months of downtime, I'm now ready to jump back into work, but given I no longer have any financial stress I'd like to focus on ways to use my skills to give back to the community. I've been writing startup software for 10+ years, have co-founded a company and exited.<p>What does HN think are some good ways to give back? Here are some avenues I've explored but have come up dry:<p>* Teaching: I'd love to teach programming to high schoolers, but most positions require some post-grad/PhD, which I do not have.<p>* Non-profit / civic work: I'd love to work with USDS, 18F, or something like that, but there don't seem to be as many open positions and USDS requires folks to be on-site in DC (not possible for me).<p>* Mentorship programs: I've done a few mentorship programs in the past, but is very high touch and infrequent - I'd like to do something more hands-on.<p>Thanks HN!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33450538\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33450538</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 13</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.stedi.com/blog/translate-between-json-and-edi", "title": "Translate Between JSON and EDI", "date_published": "2022-11-03 12:59:22+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.stedi.com/blog/translate-between-json-and-edi\">https://www.stedi.com/blog/translate-between-json-and-edi</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33450281\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33450281</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.teamblind.com/post/Stripe-layoff-14-of-the-workforce-ORCpmMEK", "title": "Stripe Layoff 14% of Workforce", "date_published": "2022-11-03 12:45:21+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.teamblind.com/post/Stripe-layoff-14-of-the-workforce-ORCpmMEK\">https://www.teamblind.com/post/Stripe-layoff-14-of-the-workforce-ORCpmMEK</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33450152\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33450152</a></p>\n<p>Points: 41</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://stripe.com/en-au/newsroom/news/ceo-patrick-collisons-email-to-stripe-employees", "title": "Stripe laying off around 14% of workforce", "date_published": "2022-11-03 12:45:21+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://stripe.com/en-au/newsroom/news/ceo-patrick-collisons-email-to-stripe-employees\">https://stripe.com/en-au/newsroom/news/ceo-patrick-collisons-email-to-stripe-employees</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33450152\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33450152</a></p>\n<p>Points: 187</p>\n<p># Comments: 103</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33450102", "title": "I am a quite good bad programmer", "date_published": "2022-11-03 12:40:32+00:00", "description": "<p>I find somethings actually strange. Per se, checking my quality as a developer with job interview questions I will receive a not so high grade. I would say between 5 to 7 out of 10. Not brilliant. But as a developer I think I am actually really good.<p>I never \"studied\" computer science in a regular way, but I am in the industry more than 20 years. I started as a hacker, reverse engineering, assembly code, moved to C and C++ and now web development in Node.JS, Go (golang) and Rust and Vanilla JS. Touched of course Python and Arduino and Raspberry PI.<p>I find it that my code and overall look as much better (if I can be a bit non modest for a second) than other developers even seniors.<p>- My code is highly readable with good comments and other can take over my code responsibility quite easily<p>- My code runs (and also complies) faster than other - I understands the usage of Hash / Map instead of searching arrays and many other small things that actually enhance the code performance<p>- I know how to KISS (Keep it stupid and simple) and so I am able to write complicated software because the basic is simple and separated so my feasible to comprehend<p>- I understands Object Oriented correctly and knows where to use it and how and when to avoid it<p>- I know not to search always the latest new shiny thing (library or framework) and use legacy software that actually do the job when needed without complications<p>- I understand how the computer works, from BIOS, BUS to OS (Linux and Windows internals)<p>- I have (again if I may say) good product skills and some UX guts which helps me manage things on my own<p>All of this together allowed me to build and sell already two startups. Develop and maintain easily many web sites and SaaS which creates me nice passive income (such as https://gematrix.org).<p>So am I a good or bad programmer? - Still I will score quite low in job
