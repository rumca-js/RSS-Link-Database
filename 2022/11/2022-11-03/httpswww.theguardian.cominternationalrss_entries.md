<p><em>Squa</em><em>li faliti</em> Jose Mourinho called them, and they await Manchester United. A first goal for 18-year-old Alejandro Garnacho was enough to defeat Real Sociedad 1-0 but was not enough to progress as winners of the group, so Erik ten Hag’s team be thrown into a playoff against one of those “failed sharks” from the Champions League, Ajax, Barcelona, Juventus, Leverkusen, Salzburg, Sevilla, Shakhtar and Sporting CP opponents that will have to be overcome to continue in this competition.</p><p>That may not be too terrifying, but it wasn’t the way they wanted it. Two more games aren’t what they wanted either. Garnacho’s superb strike after quarter of an hour had briefly given them hope of avoiding that, but one goal was not enough. United needed two, and although they might have got it when Cristiano Ronaldo ran clean through in the first half only to pass up the night’s best chance, they never truly came close again.

But arguably the genre had begun the previous year, with the staging at the New York City Opera of X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X, by the composer and pianist Anthony Davis, based on the life and death of the militant human rights campaigner <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/malcolm-x">Malcolm X</a>.</p><p>X attracted a great deal of attention and controversy at the time of the official premiere (after substantial revisions following performances in Philadelphia the previous year). Some critics dismissed it as “agitprop”, others praised its power and originality, but subsequently it has been almost entirely neglected. Davis has composed another seven operas, including the more widely performed Amistad (which, like X, has a libretto by the playwright Thulani Davis, the composer’s cousin). But the killing of George Floyd and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement has rekindled interest in the score, and as well as the Boston performances that led to this recording – not the opera’s first, as the publicity claims, for an earlier one appeared in 1992 – Detroit Opera presented a new production last May, which will transfer to the New York Met next year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/03/davis-x-the-life-and-times-of-malcolm-x-review-gil-rose-davone-tines">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is a basis for a strong connection between Lula and Biden, forged in the fire of the far-right extremism they both have faced and defeated at the polls.</p><p>In his victory speech last night, former president – and now president-elect –Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva asserted that the world missed Brazil as it sunk to a state of unprecedented international isolation in recent years. Lula, an impassioned orator used to speaking extemporaneously, calmly read prepared remarks that struck notes of harmony, healing and restoration. “It is time to put down the arms we never should have picked up,” he said at one point as his wife and future firstlady Rosângela da Silva became visibly emotional at his side. “Brazil is back,” Lula insisted, promising to “work tirelessly for a Brazil where love prevails over hate, truth over lies, and hope is bigger than fear”.</p><p>Lula’s unlikely ascent to another term in office in Latin America’s largest nation represents renewed opportunities for his country. Indeed, given the host of problems Brazil faces in the years to come, including reigning in deforestation, navigating the decline of US hegemony in the hemisphere, and reversing an alarming slide into deindustrialization, to cite just a few, it is hard to imagine someone better equipped than Lula to turn the page from Jair Bolsonaro, the outgoing far-right extremist who has governed the country since 2019.</p><p>Andre Pagliarini is an assistant professor of history at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia.

<p>How can our leaders celebrate the lives of migrants who arrived 50 years ago, yet be so inhumane towards those who need help now?</p><ul><li>Danny Sriskandarajah is chief executive of Oxfam GB</li></ul><p>Yesterday, I attended an event at Buckingham Palace to celebrate the <a href="https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/ugandan-asians-50-years-since-their-expulsion-from-uganda/#:~:text=On%204%20August%201972%2C%20Ugandan,the%20country%20of%20their%20birth">50th anniversary </a>of Britain welcoming about 30,000 Ugandan Asian refugees. It was remarkable to be among the many parliamentarians, business leaders and leading cultural figures who have emerged from a community that arrived in the UK with almost nothing. </p><p>But the celebration of the welcoming stance of a Conservative government in 1972 and the achievements of a community that the new king has called one of Britain’s “great successes” is in stark contrast to the sickening approach of the current government to refugee arrivals. And there’s the bittersweet irony that Priti Patel, a child of Ugandan Asian immigrants and also present at the event, was the pioneer of some of the most regressive migration policies Britain has seen.</p><p>Danny Sriskandarajah is chief executive of Oxfam GB</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/03/kent-migrant-crisis-migrants">Continue reading...</a>

Last night, <strong>Joe Biden</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/02/joe-biden-speech-political-violence-preserve-democracy-midterm-election">made a primetime address</a> to warn Americans about the threats to democracy posed by political violence and Republicans who deny the outcome of the 2020 election. It’s a salient message, given that many GOP candidates nationwide have embraced baseless conspiracy theories about the election that brought Biden to power, but there’s a problem: poll after poll has shown most Americans have a sour view of Biden’s time in office, to the point that the president is avoiding many swing states in the final days before the 8 November midterms.

## Daniel Avery: Ultra Truth review – a perfectly balanced cocktail of euphoria and disquiet

<p><strong>(Phantasy Sound)<br /></strong>Introspective and propulsive, intense and opaque: these instrumentals tie the disparate strands of the producer’s oeuvre into a coherent, compelling whole</p><p>In September 2020, Daniel Avery released Lone Swordsman, a track he wrote on the day his friend and sometime collaborator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/18/andrew-weatherall-obituary">Andrew Weatherall</a> died. Of all the tributes paid to the revered DJ/producer, it might be the most striking: a simple melody endlessly dancing over melancholy chords, it’s an exquisitely beautiful four minutes of music. Clearly it was the product of a moment where everything clicked into place: Avery has talked vaguely about “the cosmic energy of the universe” having a role in its creation, but whatever was behind it, Lone Swordsman had a strong claim to be called the best thing that he had ever released. But it didn’t appear on his subsequent album, Together in Static. In fairness, it probably wouldn’t have fitted the mood. Together in Static was a collection of tracks he had written for a seated and socially distanced performance he gave at London’s Hackney Church in June 2020, imbued with all the tentative optimism you might expect given the circumstances, and, while there’s a definite warmth about Lone Swordsman, the overriding emotion it evokes is desperate sadness.</p><p>Instead, it turns up towards the end of Together in Static’s successor, where it fits perfectly, not just because Ultra Truth feels like an emotionally complex album – it manages to be both introspective and propulsive, intense and opaque – but because of its quality. Avery has had a rich and varied career since the release of his 2013 debut album Drone Logic, taking in releases that, in their scope and ambition at least, recalled the blockbusting crossover dance albums of the mid-90s – Underworld’s dubnobasswithmyheadman, Leftfield’s Leftism, the Chemical Brothers’ Surrender – alongside stuff such as 2020’s Illusion of Time, an experimental collaboration with Italian electronic auteur and Nine Inch Nails bassist Alessandro Cortini.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/03/daniel-avery-ultra-truth-review-phantasy-sound-producer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This timid sitcom set in the last ever video rental store has such a dated feel. In the age of streaming services, this isn’t good enough</p><p>Those of us old enough to remember the ceremony of renting a film at the weekend may be curious to see what nostalgia Blockbuster (Netflix) is able to conjure up.

## Abortion is a bread-and-butter economic issue. We need to treat it that way

<p>Parenthood, criminality or death: these are now the all-too-expensive options for many women in the wake of the Dobbs decision</p><p>Being a parent is expensive. Being a criminal is also expensive, whether you lose economic opportunities to avoid apprehension or spend money on your defense if apprehended or go to prison and lose everything and, marked as a felon, emerge unemployable. Abortion is an economic issue, because when it’s not legal, those are the two remaining options, leaving out being dead, which you could argue is either very expensive or absolutely beyond the realms of money and price. And being dead is also on the table because women have all too often died from lack of access to reproductive healthcare, including abortions (to say nothing of being unable to leave an abuser, to whom pregnancy and children can bind you more tightly). They are facing more of that now.</p><p>Having no options but to be dead, criminal or a parent is not a sane or moral argument for parenthood, and it’s also pretty different than having certain inalienable rights, including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Also, now that abortion is unavailable under almost all circumstances in Texas and other states, it’s an economic justice issue in that those with the financial capacity to take time off, travel in search of care and pay for it out of pocket are not affected the way those who cannot do so are. And those who can afford to get an abortion under these circumstances are also those who can afford to defend themselves against possible criminal charges.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/03/abortion-women-inequality-dobbs-supreme-court">Continue reading...</a>

He can watch the neighbouring family as if they were fish in an aquarium.</p><p>This seems to set us up for a strange and unsettling story.

<p>It’s unsurprising the actor has yet to direct another film after giving so much to this blistering debut, acted at full tilt by a remarkable cast</p><p>Twenty-five years ago, Gary Oldman opened an artery of anguish with his brilliant, wrenchingly emotional debut as writer-director inspired by his own father and his childhood in south London, positioned between Terence Davies and Martin Scorsese. The title conveys with horrible force both violence and the cost of violence. “Nil by mouth” is what you see over an intravenously fed patient’s hospital bed – and yet the phrase is also a metaphor for the dad’s dysfunction, the walled-off emotional aridity; nil by mouth, no kissing, no talking, nothing.</p><p>It is an urban pastoral and social-realist tragedy. Watched again now, you can appreciate how formally accomplished it is, how emotionally extravagant, and acted at full tilt by a remarkable cast. Ray Winstone is Ray, the angry and self-hating drinker and coke addict running a shadowy line in drug distribution with his dodgy mate Mark – an excellent, garrulous performance from Jamie Foreman. Ray has employed his unreliable young brother-in-law Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) who has evidently tasted the supply and got pathetically hooked on smack. Kathy Burke won Best Actress at Cannes for her moving performance as Ray’s abused wife Val. Oldman cast his sister Laila Morse (in her acting debut) as Val’s mother Janet, and Edna Doré is tremendous as Val’s grandmother Kath; she has a heart-wrenching final song, Can’t Help Loving That Man of Mine (the vocal, in fact, comes from Oldman’s own mum, Kathleen). The young Neil Maskell has a cameo as a guy who gets into a fight with Billy at the local launderette, and Eric Clapton composed the original music.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/03/nil-by-mouth-review-gary-oldmans-overwhelming-study-of-family-violence">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Increasingly prevalent line may sound dubious, but talking it through sensitively could have unexpected benefits</p><p>The film Triangle of Sadness, released last month, features an “extreme vomiting” scene that has divided opinion among viewers.

<p>The fascinating story of two Nasa rovers that ended up spending 15 years on Mars verges into cloying territory</p><p>Dusty, colder than cold, 139,000 miles away from the sun, Mars isn’t the most hospitable of environments. Nor is it the most universally compelling of film settings. Not everybody, after all, wants to go on a space odyssey, let alone one whose protagonists are robotic vehicles. Ryan White, the director of a feelgood documentary about a recent feat of American space exploration, came up with a solution: take a subject that is literally lifeless, and draw parallels – however improbable – to the human condition.</p><p>Co-produced by Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment and narrated by Angela Bassett’s soothing voice, Good Night Oppy faithfully if somewhat cloyingly relays the story of a 1993 mission to Mars that was supposed to last for 90 days but ended up going for 15 years. Spirit and Opportunity, the marvelous machines at the heart of the movie, might look more like ostriches than people, with their long necks and camera eyes sitting on the sides of their boxy heads. But this is a film engineered to unleash swells of connection and emotion, and part of that involves presenting the rovers as adorable and quirky 5ft 2in humans.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/03/good-night-oppy-review-spielberg-assisted-mars-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

But can he make the platform matter again – or will it become a hellscape of hateful content and misinformation?<br /></p><p>Twitter isn’t a good place to be right now. That’s nothing new, but the day-to-day awfulness has been ramped up by Elon Musk’s chaotic acquisition. In the week since he marched through the company’s San Francisco office holding a basin – so that he could tweet “let that sink in” – and dubbed himself first “chief twit” and then “Twitter complaint hotline operator” (his actual title, according to internal systems, is boring old “chief executive officer”), the world’s richest man has done the corporate-takeover equivalent of flipping the table halfway through a game of chess.</p><p>Externally, the changes are slim, but significant. One of his first acts was to order a change in the site’s homepage. If you visit <a href="https://Twitter.com">Twitter.com</a> without being logged into an account, you will no longer be sent to a log-in page; instead, you’ll be taken to the Explore tab, the site’s algorithmically curated selection of the best tweets and most popular trends.

## The many meanings of moss

<p>Moss is ancient, and grows at a glacial pace, but it lives alongside us everywhere, country and city, a witness to the human world and its catastrophic speed. What can we learn by tuning in to ‘moss time’?</p><p>On the cusp of winter 2021, I went for a walk in the woods near my house in Oxford. By a bench that overlooks the city, I happened upon a moss-covered log that glistened green under the overcast sky. The moss’s leaves were as tiny and intricate as the finest embroidery, and as thin as clingfilm. I brushed my fingertips over the feathery bed in awe of its minuteness and complexity, before taking a dozen photographs. When was the last time I had touched moss? When was the first? I remember trees, rivers, mountains, but not moss. But, that day, I felt as if moss summoned me to pay attention to its rigour and beauty amid its great arboreal cousins.</p><p>Or rather, moss represented something for me. I’d been thinking <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/touch-is-a-language-we-cannot-afford-to-forget">about touch</a>, about how out of touch with nature I am. I live in a city that has many parks and meadows, but I don’t <em>touch</em> nature enough; rather, I see it – the ornamental birches, the canal, the roses on the hedgerows. In summertime, I’ll swim with friends, or sunbathe and roll in sand and grass, but once we are back in our sanitised homes, I continue to live out of touch. I seek nature in small, appropriate, hygienic doses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/03/the-many-meanings-of-moss">Continue reading...</a>

The bulk of the film’s first 15 minutes takes place in 2016, as a strikingly younger Gomez – she was 23 then, 30 now – prepares for the world tour in support of her 2015 album Revival, the project meant to refashion her image from Disney star to single adult sexual being.</p><p>The footage has all the hallmarks of a tour documentary — a relaxed, more profane version of Gomez in costume fittings and tour rehearsals; a moment in which she cracks from the pressure, panicking through tears to friends and crew that nothing is good enough; a montage of cities and stages and poses and cheers and crying, overwhelmed fans. And then, cut. The Revival tour was cancelled after 55 performances, as Gomez entered a psychiatric facility. Talking heads who don’t appear for the rest of the film attest to the absolute hell Gomez was in. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/03/selena-gomez-my-mind-me-review-a-fascinating-and-frustrating-pop-doc">Continue reading...</a>

He takes over a social network that is facing a tricky regulatory environment in many of the 100-plus countries in which it operates. It faces a crossroads of attitudes towards hate speech and moderation. And it has to somehow turn a profit in order to justify the huge outlay Musk has made.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/nov/03/can-twitter-survive-elon-musk-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
