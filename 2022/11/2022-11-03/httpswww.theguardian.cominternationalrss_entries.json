Last night, <strong>Joe Biden</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/02/joe-biden-speech-political-violence-preserve-democracy-midterm-election\">made a primetime address</a> to warn Americans about the threats to democracy posed by political violence and Republicans who deny the outcome of the 2020 election. It\u2019s a salient message, given that many GOP candidates nationwide have embraced baseless conspiracy theories about the election that brought Biden to power, but there\u2019s a problem: poll after poll has shown most Americans have a sour view of Biden\u2019s time in office, to the point that the president is avoiding many swing states in the final days before the 8 November midterms. Last night\u2019s speech was meant as a reminder to voters of what the stakes are in next week\u2019s elections. We\u2019ll see if they care.</p><p>Here\u2019s what else is happening today:</p><p><strong>Biden heads out west</strong>, first to deliver remarks on student debt relief at a community college in Albuquerque, New Mexico, then to rally with democratic candidates. After that, he\u2019s in San Diego, California, where he will appear at an event for democratic congressman <strong>Mike Levin</strong>.</p><p><strong>Vice-president Kamala Harris</strong> will go to New York to rally Democrats.</p><p><strong>Midterm countdown:</strong> we are five days away from Tuesday\u2019s election.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/nov/03/midterms-2022-biden-speech-trump-election-politics-latest\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2022/nov/03/freedom-forum-and-northern-lights-thursdays-best-photos", "title": "Freedom Forum and northern lights: Thursday\u2019s best photos", "date_published": "2022-11-03 12:55:54+00:00", "description": "<p>The Guardian\u2019s picture editors select photo highlights from around the world</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2022/nov/03/freedom-forum-and-northern-lights-thursdays-best-photos\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/01/us-election-deniers-trump-big-lie-republican-midterm-candidates-running", "title": "US midterms 2022: the key candidates who threaten democracy", "date_published": "2022-11-03 12:53:43+00:00", "description": "<p>In several states Republican candidates who dispute the 2020 election results are running for positions that would give them control over elections</p><p>There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/11/us-midterms-congress-senate-house-races-to-watch\">several races on the ballot</a> this fall that will have profound consequences for American democracy.

Of all the tributes paid to the revered DJ/producer, it might be the most striking: a simple melody endlessly dancing over melancholy chords, it\u2019s an exquisitely beautiful four minutes of music. Clearly it was the product of a moment where everything clicked into place: Avery has talked vaguely about \u201cthe cosmic energy of the universe\u201d having a role in its creation, but whatever was behind it, Lone Swordsman had a strong claim to be called the best thing that he had ever released. But it didn\u2019t appear on his subsequent album, Together in Static. In fairness, it probably wouldn\u2019t have fitted the mood. Together in Static was a collection of tracks he had written for a seated and socially distanced performance he gave at London\u2019s Hackney Church in June 2020, imbued with all the tentative optimism you might expect given the circumstances, and, while there\u2019s a definite warmth about Lone Swordsman, the overriding emotion it evokes is desperate sadness.</p><p>Instead, it turns up towards the end of Together in Static\u2019s successor, where it fits perfectly, not just because Ultra Truth feels like an emotionally complex album \u2013 it manages to be both introspective and propulsive, intense and opaque \u2013 but because of its quality. Avery has had a rich and varied career since the release of his 2013 debut album Drone Logic, taking in releases that, in their scope and ambition at least, recalled the blockbusting crossover dance albums of the mid-90s \u2013 Underworld\u2019s dubnobasswithmyheadman, Leftfield\u2019s Leftism, the Chemical Brothers\u2019 Surrender \u2013 alongside stuff such as 2020\u2019s Illusion of Time, an experimental collaboration with Italian electronic auteur and Nine Inch Nails bassist Alessandro Cortini.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/03/daniel-avery-ultra-truth-review-phantasy-sound-producer\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/03/world-cup-2022-team-guide-netherlands", "title": "World Cup 2022 team guides part 2: Netherlands", "date_published": "2022-11-03 12:00:14+00:00", "description": "<p>Louis van Gaal has once again ditched the famous 4-3-3 and seems to have won over Virgil van Dijk and the other doubters</p><p><em>This article is part of the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/world-cup-2022--guardian-experts--network\">World Cup 2022 Experts\u2019 Network</a>, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 20 November.</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/03/world-cup-2022-team-guide-netherlands\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/03/imran-khan-shot-in-assassination-attempt-in-pakistan", "title": "Imran Khan \u2018shot in foot in assassination attempt\u2019 in Pakistan", "date_published": "2022-11-03 11:58:37+00:00", "description": "<p>Former prime minister wounded when convoy came under fire in east of the country according to multiple reports</p><p>The former Pakistan prime minister, Imran Khan, was wounded when his convoy was shot at in the country\u2019s east, multiple local news channels have said.</p><p>Khan was leading a protest march on Islamabad to demand snap elections.

The title conveys with horrible force both violence and the cost of violence. \u201cNil by mouth\u201d is what you see over an intravenously fed patient\u2019s hospital bed \u2013 and yet the phrase is also a metaphor for the dad\u2019s dysfunction, the walled-off emotional aridity; nil by mouth, no kissing, no talking, nothing.</p><p>It is an urban pastoral and social-realist tragedy. Watched again now, you can appreciate how formally accomplished it is, how emotionally extravagant, and acted at full tilt by a remarkable cast. Ray Winstone is Ray, the angry and self-hating drinker and coke addict running a shadowy line in drug distribution with his dodgy mate Mark \u2013 an excellent, garrulous performance from Jamie Foreman. Ray has employed his unreliable young brother-in-law Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) who has evidently tasted the supply and got pathetically hooked on smack. Kathy Burke won Best Actress at Cannes for her moving performance as Ray\u2019s abused wife Val. Oldman cast his sister Laila Morse (in her acting debut) as Val\u2019s mother Janet, and Edna Dor\u00e9 is tremendous as Val\u2019s grandmother Kath; she has a heart-wrenching final song, Can\u2019t Help Loving That Man of Mine (the vocal, in fact, comes from Oldman\u2019s own mum, Kathleen). The young Neil Maskell has a cameo as a guy who gets into a fight with Billy at the local launderette, and Eric Clapton composed the original music.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/03/nil-by-mouth-review-gary-oldmans-overwhelming-study-of-family-violence\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/03/world-leaders-cop27-egypt-demand-release-alaa-abd-el-fattah", "title": "World leaders at Cop27 can\u2019t ignore the plight of imprisoned Alaa Abd El-Fattah | Caroline Lucas", "date_published": "2022-11-03 09:00:10+00:00", "description": "<p>While climate justice is debated at the summit, justice is failing the activist who is six months into a hunger strike</p><ul><li>Caroline Lucas is the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion</li></ul><p>You probably haven\u2019t heard of Alaa Abd El-Fattah \u2013 so let me tell you about him.
