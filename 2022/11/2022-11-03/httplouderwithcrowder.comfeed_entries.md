Mrs. Sicknick is the mother of Officer Brian Sicknick, a Capitol police officer who <a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/capitol-police-officer-brian-sicknick-suffered-two-strokes-died-of-natural-causes-officials" target="_blank">died on January 7th of natural causes</a>. Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) routinely claim without evidence that he was killed on January 6th, and that anyone who questioned the 2020 election is responsible for his death. That includes if you weren't even in DC that week like <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kari-lake-volunteer-research" target="_blank">Kari Lake</a> wasn't.</p><p>The cynical attack ad is meant to do two things. One is to put <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kari-lake-milk-bull" target="_blank">Kari Lake</a> on defense over January 6th. The other is to bait her into attacking a grieving mother. Lake did none of those things.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">A CBS reporter just asked me about the latest desperate attack ad accusing ME of causing the death of a Capitol Police Officer.<br /><br />As a mother, here was my response: <a href="https://t.co/dol7OEFQaw">pic.twitter.com/dol7OEFQaw</a><br />— Kari Lake (@KariLake) <a href="https://twitter.com/KariLake/status/1587939018494181376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>I am so sorry about the death of your son. It is tragic. I am a mother myself and it breaks my heart. That is a wound when you lose a child, no matter how old they are, that never heals. So I don't want to disparage her. I feel for her and I see the pain in her eyes.</blockquote><p>Sadly, Mrs. Sicknick is not the only mother who has prematurely lost her son over the past few years. This brings us to the next part of Lake's response when she sees that same loss in the eyes of mothers and fathers as she's out on the campaign trail.</p><blockquote>We are losing thousands of young people. When they tell me they lost a son or daughter to fentanyl. This is why we are pushing so hard to secure that border and stop fentanyl from pouring across.</blockquote><p>Kari Lake didn't take the bait. She didn't give Democrats the soundbite she was looking for. She expressed her empathy for the mother attacking her. And she turned it around to one of the issues she is campaigning on. Not mentioned once? The words "January" or "sixth."</p><p>I can't think of a single candidate or official on either side with the retail political skills to do that. Hats off to Kari Lake.</p><p><p>

## Watch: 'The View's' Sonny Hostin goes on racist tirade comparing white women to roaches

And few in the media resemble this attitude more than <em>The View's</em> <a href="" target="_blank">Sonny Hostin</a>.</p><p>Hostin was appalled at a recent poll she saw for next Tuesday's election. White women are more concerned with affording to feed their families and that their loved ones <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kathy-hochul-locking-up-criminals" target="_blank">are able to leave the house without getting killed</a> than they are that their "right" to abort choices might be limited to fifteen weeks in some states. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Racist Sunny says "white Republican suburban women" are "roaches" because they're voting for the Republican party.<br />"They're voting against their own self-interest!" she screams.

It’s almost like roaches voting for Raid.</blockquote><p>She also derped the usual hits of "voting against their best interests" and "ZOMG, THE HANDMAID'S TAIL PEOPLE!" Odd that she would refer to others as "low information" when she <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/new-york-governor-2022" target="_blank">lives in New York City</a>. NYC is in New York, a state that Democrats would legalize abortion to the seventh trimester if they could get away with it.</p><p>When reached for a response on behalf of white women, Mary Katherine Ham had this to say:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">"These women are like roaches who are too dumb to know what's good for them!

Yet, the party that believes all Hispanics <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jill-biden-tacos-journalist" target="_blank">are tacos</a> at best and Latinx's at worst, or that black people <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-junk-fees" target="_blank">can't book airline tickets without help</a>, doesn't seem to realize that. Though it looks like white women are going to be who gets the most blame when Democrats are mollywhopped next week. </p><p><p>

## GOP Gov candidate threatened to be 'skinned alive' days before Biden's speech calling GOP a 'threat to democracy'

I think I'm doing this right.<br /></p><p>Biden is the most divisive president this country has seen over the past two years.  We have seen him <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/extreme-rhetoric-democrats-2022" target="_self">lash out at half the country</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/filibuster-jen-psaki-peter-doocy" target="_self">claim they're racist </a>for <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-tulsi-gabbard" target="_self">disagreeing with him on legislation</a> or  <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/slavery-doocy-jean-pierre-kamala">Supreme Court decisions</a>. Now, a man has been arrested for threatening to kill Republican Illinois gubernatorial candidate Darren Bailey.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2022/11/2/23436894/darren-bailey-voicemail-death-threat" target="_blank">Chicago Sun Times</a>,  Scott Lennox is charged with one felony count each of threatening a public official, telephone harassment and harassment by electronic communications. His voicemail threat echoing rhetoric used by Biden Democrats caused schools to go into lockdown.</p><blockquote>“I’m going to skin Darren Bailey alive, making sure he is still alive, and I’m going to feed his f——— family to him as he is alive and screaming in f——— pain,” prosecutors say Lennox said in the voicemail. He also allegedly made statements about abortion in his message.<br /><br />He further said, “He is a piece of <strong>white a— racist </strong>s—-, and honestly if he doesn’t kill himself, I will. You know what? I know where he lives. I know where he sleeps. I know where his kids sleep. And I know the f——— school he works at,” prosecutors allege he said. Lennox also said “the candidate teaching all this mother f——— <strong>misinformation</strong> is going to die. So honestly he should just kill himself before anything else happens.”</blockquote><p>The voicemail was received on the same day as the Paul Pelosi attack. On Wednesday, Joe Biden responded to the Pelosi attack (but not what happened to Bailey) in a speech where he claimed without evidence that his GOP opponents are a threat to democracy. Biden says he doesn't mean "all" Republicans, but I've yet to hear him name one he likes outside of Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger, or Larry Hogan.<br /></p><p>Biden <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-calling-for-americans-to-unite-demonizes-republicans-as-a-threat-to-democracy" target="_blank">said on Wednesday</a> that questioning election results is “an article of faith in the MAGA Republican Party," while also presenting without evidence that the GOP is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cnn-chyron-georgia" target="_blank">trying to suppress the rights of voters</a>. </p><p>Side note: here are ten minutes of the Biden Democrat Party questioning the results of free and fair elections.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Here is something the January 6 Committee doesn't want you to see.<br /><br />WATCH: 10 minutes of Democrats denying election results. <a href="https://t.co/bJRbzEcIO2">pic.twitter.com/bJRbzEcIO2</a><br />— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) <a href="https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1580605995164008448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Get a load of this guy:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>As of this writing, no one in the Biden Democrat Party or Biden's supporters in the media has shown the courage to denounce Joe Biden's incendiary rhetoric. If anything, they have tripled down on it. </p><p><p>

## Instagram video goes viral illustrating where progressives can stick their 'pandemic amnesty'

Because many on the right, particularly mothers, were questioning the pandemic early on. Not as early on as Editor Emeritus Courtney Kirchoff. But, early enough to have the same reaction to <em>The Atlantic</em> saying "Let's Declare a Pandemic Amnesty."</p><p>To summarize:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Nope. You can eat all the dicks with this. <a href="https://t.co/qvFAF6pDRt">pic.twitter.com/qvFAF6pDRt</a><br />— Brodigan Prime Plus (@brodigan) <a href="https://twitter.com/brodigan/status/1587083748713054208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Long story short, people who were complete and utter douchebags to anyone who challenged the slightest bit of government narrative about the pandemic want to forgive and forget. They don't want to apologize. They won't admit they were wrong. But you should let them off the hook anyway with your forgiveness and your forgettingness.</p><p>Podcaster Jennifer Mock released a video showing how ridiculous such an argument sounds out loud.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="instagram-media"><div style="padding: 16px;"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CkdtdLtPN5r/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;" target="_blank"> <div style="display: flex;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"></div> <div style="display: flex;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;"></div></div></div><div style="padding: 19% 0;"></div> <div style="display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;"></div><div style="padding-top: 8px;"> <div style="color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style="padding: 12.5% 0;"></div> <div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;"><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div style="margin-left: 8px;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;"></div> <div></div></div><div style="margin-left: auto;"> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;"></div></div></a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CkdtdLtPN5r/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">A post shared by Jennifer Mock | the Quiet Out Loud podcast (@jlmock4.0)</a><br /></div></blockquote> </div><blockquote>PURPLE HAIRED-FREAK: I know I called you a grandma killer, but I really just wanted what was best for you.<br />BASED MAMA: I actually couldn't visit my grandma in the hospital, or even attend her funeral.<br />PURPLE HAIRED-FREAK: But my heart was in the right place.<br /></blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>The best part of the video, hands down, is the purple-haired virtue-signaling freak wearing a "Free Britney" t-shirt. Nothing drives home the "I support the latest thing" of it all than the Free Britney Spears moment. Jennifer could have gone with a Ukraine Flag and made the same point. She went with a more creative decision. Hats off to that!</p><p>I'm a reasonable person. If you are someone who wants "amnesty" instead of admitting you were wrong, I'm sure we can work out an agreement. How about you go visit <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mask-meltdown-top-5" target="_blank">all of our favorite mask nazis</a> over the last few years. If that is too much work (because there were multitudes), you can <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mask-school-calaifornia-cops" target="_blank">stick to schools</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/raids-preschools-mask-noncompliance" target="_blank">the adults</a> who <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/disney-chase-girl-away-pooh" target="_blank">went out of their way</a> to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mask-girl-locked-outside-school" target="_blank">torture kids</a> so that they felt "safe." Bonus points if you let Editor Emeritus Courtney do the interviewing.</p><p>Stick a camera in their face and ask them "are you proud of yourselves?" When you get back to me with the content, we can discuss your amnesty.</p><p><p>

## A Republican could upset the NEW YORK governor's race if these early voting numbers hold up

If you took away New York City, New York would be the purplest state in the country. In fact, you could probably get away with just yeeting Manhattan and Brooklyn. The rest of the state is normal, Everywhere Else USA. Democrats have remained in control due to decades of using social issues to manipulate NYC voters to vote against their best interests. That's why <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kathy-hochul-locking-up-criminals" target="_blank">Kathy Hochul</a> is panicking like Andrew Cuomo caught with his hand up someone's blouse.</p><p>Councilman Joe Borelli (representing the Slums of Shaolin) shared the early vote totals compared to where they were two years ago. NYC is SIGNIFICANTLY underperforming the rest of the state.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">NYC is significantly … SIGNIFICANTLY… <br />Underperforming in early voting when compared to 2020. Draw your own conclusions as to why Hochul is panicking. <a href="https://t.co/ahkR3Cdcgw">pic.twitter.com/ahkR3Cdcgw</a><br />— Joe Borelli (@JoeBorelliNYC) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBorelliNYC/status/1587951392114851843?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Here's the chart:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="44f67" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32038820&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>It isn't <em>quite</em> an apples-to-apples comparison. It's a presidential year vs a midterm year (there was no early voting in 2018). One could assume Long Island and Mid-Hudson are higher than the rest of the state because that's where the competitive congressional races are. NYC is still 10% LESS than two years ago compared to most of the other regions. NYC is also the one reliable Democrat stronghold. Turnout is WAY down in the area Democrats need it to be through the roof.</p><p>Maybe everyone is waiting until next Tuesday. Perhaps Hochul's "all abortion, all the time, always" messaging isn't working in the region as she was expecting. It could be <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/thugs-beat-taxi-driver-death" target="_blank">that crime is so bad</a> in NYC, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/queens-man-broad-daylight" target="_blank">people are afraid to leave</a> their homes.</p><p>What I do know is that if a Republican can squeak by NYC with only 35% of the vote, they'll win statewide. If NYC turnout stays like this, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lee-zeldin-attacker-pants-cries" target="_blank">Congressman Lee Zeldin</a> is -- GOD WILLING -- our next Governor.</p><p>I say this as someone who has worked on the GOP side for the last two statewide election cycles. There hasn't been this much palpable energy for a statewide Republican candidate in decades. There is a reason Kathy Hochul is panicked. These early voting numbers are another example as to why.</p><p><p>

## Elon Musk's latest tweet dunking on AOC continues to make her look silly (and she doesn't help matters)

AOC look silly on Twitter. Odd, because had it not been for Twitter, Rep. AOC would barely exist. Yet besides owning the bird app, Musk now also owns Rep. AOC.</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aoc-free-speech" target="_blank">To recap where we left you yesterday</a>, Rep. AOC said it's not "free speech" for Musk to charge bluecheckmarks $8 a month for their blue checkmark. The social media influencer, who has a side hustle as a member of Congress, thought the "free" in "free speech" meant money and not freedom. Musk graciously responded that he has heard her criticism, but she is being charged $8 a month anyway.</p><p>Musk has since followed up with a comparison. For the cost of one Rep. AOC sweatshirt, you can rent a blue checkmark on Twitter for six months.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">🤔 <a href="https://t.co/XuJdfMTTi1">pic.twitter.com/XuJdfMTTi1</a><br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587923502354472960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Like many social media influencers, Rep.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1587968426374561793" target="_blank">She then claimed without evidence</a> that her "Twitter mentions/notifications conveniently aren’t working tonight" and needed someone to text her Musk's response. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>It harkens back to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-aoc-tweet" target="_blank">the last time Musk made Rep. AOC look foolish</a>. Back in April, when the Musk/Twitter saga began, the social media influencer went off on one of her infamous low-information rants about people who have more money than her.  Elon knew what it was really about, and while he was flattered, Rep. AOC isn't his type.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Stop hitting on me, I’m really shy ☺️<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1520152887090892800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>News reports this morning say Musk <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/the-purge-begins-musk-is-terminating-massive-number-of-twitter-employees-on-friday-report-says" target="_blank">plans to lay off up to 50% of Twitter's bloated workforce</a> by Friday.

## GOP Gov candidate assaulted on same day Biden gives divisive speech calling GOP a 'threat To democracy'

I think I'm doing this right.</p><p>Biden is the most divisive president this country has seen over the past two years.  We have seen him <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/extreme-rhetoric-democrats-2022" target="_self">lash out at half the country</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/filibuster-jen-psaki-peter-doocy" target="_self">claim they're racist </a>for <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-tulsi-gabbard" target="_self">disagreeing with him on legislation</a> or  <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/slavery-doocy-jean-pierre-kamala">Supreme Court decisions</a>. Now in New Hampshire, Republican gubernatorial candidate Gen. Don Bolduc was physically attacked before his debate against his Democrat opponent.</p><p>A Bolduc spokesman tells <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/midterm-election/2022/11/02/republican-gen-bolduc-physically-attacked-by-individual-outside-wednesdays-debate/" target="_blank">Breitbart News</a>: “Prior to the debate, an individual in the crowd gathered outside attempted to punch the General and was quickly apprehended and arrested."</p><p>The attack happened on the same day Joe Biden gave another divisive speech, claiming without evidence that his GOP opponents are a threat to democracy. Biden says he doesn't mean "all" Republicans, but I've yet to hear him name one he likes outside of Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger, or Larry Hogan.</p><p>Biden <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-calling-for-americans-to-unite-demonizes-republicans-as-a-threat-to-democracy" target="_blank">said on Wednesday</a> that questioning election results is “an article of faith in the MAGA Republican Party," while also presenting without evidence that the GOP is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cnn-chyron-georgia" target="_blank">trying to suppress the rights of voters</a>. </p><p>Side note: here are ten minutes of the Biden Democrat Party questioning the results of free and fair elections.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Here is something the January 6 Committee doesn't want you to see.<br /><br />WATCH: 10 minutes of Democrats denying election results. <a href="https://t.co/bJRbzEcIO2">pic.twitter.com/bJRbzEcIO2</a><br />— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) <a href="https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1580605995164008448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Get a load of this guy:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>As of this writing, no one in the Biden Democrat Party or Biden's supporters in the media has shown the courage to denounce Joe Biden's incendiary rhetoric. If anything, they have tripled down on it. </p><p><p>
