On Thursday, AMD revealed its own 4K gaming champion, and the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT aim to topple Nvidia&rsquo;s goliath with help from a stash of smart tricks that could make David himself blush. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to improved ray tracing capabilities, the addition of AI cores, and memory galore, these first RDNA 3-architecture GPUs are also the first graphics cards featuring a multi-die &ldquo;chiplet&rdquo; design, swiping inspiration from <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1074246/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-review.html\">AMD&rsquo;s epic Ryzen success</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX reveal\" class=\"wp-image-1370458\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Scott-Herkelman.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>AMD Navi Launch in Las Vegas, Nevada, Thursday, November 3, 2022.<br />\n(Photo by PaulSakuma.com Photography)</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Better yet? Just like when Ryzen disrupted Intel&rsquo;s stranglehold on CPUs, moving to chiplets helps AMD drastically undercut Nvidia&rsquo;s pricing. While the RTX 4090 costs a chest-clutching $1,599, and the impending GeForce RTX 4080 costs $1,199, the new 24GB Radeon RX 7900 XTX costs $999 and the 20GB RX 7900 will cost $899 when they launch on December 13. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if AMD&rsquo;s flagship doesn&rsquo;t manage to go quite toe-to-toe with Nvidia&rsquo;s beast when the benchmark dust finally settles, it should still be insanely fast&mdash;and sport a much more palatable price tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s dig in.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure><h2 id=\"meet-amds-rdna-3-chiplets\">Meet AMD&rsquo;s RDNA 3 chiplets</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Comparing AMD and Nvidia&rsquo;s strategies to David and Goliath seems especially salient here. Nvidia slammed the pedal to the metal with its new &ldquo;Ada Lovelace&rdquo; architecture in the RTX 4090. The 4090 packs a gigantic 608mm<sup>2</sup> GPU, crammed with 76.3 billion transistors. Those envelop everything you&rsquo;d normally expect in a GPU die, from media and display engines to the memory controls. It truly is a goliath of a GPU.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AMD RDNA 3 Radeon details\" class=\"wp-image-1370467\" height=\"663\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rdna-3-chiplets.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX reveal\" class=\"wp-image-1370463\" height=\"792\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Dr-Lisa-Su-Stage-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>AMD Navi Launch in Las Vegas, Nevada, Thursday, November 3, 2022.<br />\n(Photo by PaulSakuma.com Photography)</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>With RDNA 3 and the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, AMD chose a different path. It still contains a central GPU die, of course&mdash;you need one&mdash;but it measures a comparably paltry 300mm<sup>2</sup>, built using a 5nm TSMC manufacturing node similar to Nvidia&rsquo;s. That&rsquo;s because AMD split its GDDR6 memory interface and second-generation <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393733/rdna-2-deep-dive-inside-amd-radeon-rx-6000-graphics-cards.html#toc-2\">Infinity Cache</a> into separate dies&mdash;six in total&mdash;made using the more mature and cost-efficient 6nm node. It&rsquo;s a radical change for GPU design, and one that helps AMD keep costs down. All told, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX wields 58 billion transistors.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AMD RDNA 3 Radeon details\" class=\"wp-image-1370471\" height=\"668\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rdna-3-memory-die.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT each come equipped with 96MB of that Infinity Cache (which is basically on-die L3 cache for faster memory transfers and gaming speeds), with each of the six dies also sporting 64-bit memory controllers. That&rsquo;s less than what the RDNA 2-based Radeon RX 6900 XT and 6800-series packed&mdash;those had 128MB&mdash;but AMD product technology architect Sam Naffziger explained that this version of Infinity Cache has been configured to do more with less, especially paired to the 24GB of GDDR6 memory over a broad 384-bit bus (or 20GB/320-bit bus in the 7900 XT&rsquo;s case).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tuned this Infinity Cache to enable better data reuse with less capacity to accomplish several things for us,&rdquo; Naffziger said. &ldquo;With the high hit rates, it directly sources most of the memory requests. This delivers data to the engine in less time and uses less power than going out to DRAM.&rdquo; In sum, he said, RDNA 3&rsquo;s Infinity Cache offers 2.7x the peak bandwidth provided by its successor, delivering up to 5.3 <em>terabytes per second </em>for instructions that stay within the GPU and Infinity Cache.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bottom line: The Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT won&rsquo;t leave you wanting for memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"radeon-rx-7900-xtx-inside-rdna-3s-gpu-upgrades\">Radeon RX 7900 XTX: Inside RDNA 3&rsquo;s GPU upgrades</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But don&rsquo;t let the introduction of discrete memory dies fool you: The core RDNA 3 GPU also received some serious upgrades.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AMD RDNA 3 Radeon details\" class=\"wp-image-1370470\" height=\"670\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rdna-3-gpu-die.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Architecture tweaks, the migration to TSMC&rsquo;s advanced 5nm node, and splitting out the memory to its own trailing-node chiplet helped AMD exceed its efficiency goals, with CEO Lisa Su claiming that RDNA 3 offers 54 percent higher performance-per-watt than RDNA 2. That let AMD stick with a traditional 2x 8-pin power connector design, neatly side-stepping the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1361471/multiple-rtx-4090-owners-report-melting-12vhpwr-power-cables.html\">melting 12VHPWR adapter controversy</a> Nvidia finds itself embroiled in with the RTX 4090.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With RDNA 3, AMD managed to squeeze in 54 percent <em>more </em>transistors than with RDNA 2, in a smaller area, for an overall density improvement of 165 percent. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX reveal\" class=\"wp-image-1370465\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AMD-RDNA-3-Radeon-RX-7900-XTX-6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The modest power requirements help the Radeon RX 7900 XTX fit into traditional mid-tower PC cases much more easily than rival RTX 4090 GPUs.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s all well and good, but gamers are more interested in what those fancy new RDNA 3 dies <em>do</em>. A deeper dive will no doubt come before the Radeon RX 7900 XTX&rsquo;s December 13 launch date, but AMD provided some tantalizing morsels of information today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>RDNA 3 switches to a new &ldquo;unified&rdquo; compute unit that uses dual-issue wave 32 units, so AMD can issue either integer or floating point instructions as needed depending on the workload, which Naffziger says can speed up gaming frame rates and AI tasks alike. An enhanced general purpose register file with 50 percent more capacity than the RDNA 2 design likewise helps keep all tasks fed.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AMD RDNA 3 Radeon details\" class=\"wp-image-1370476\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rdna-3-AI.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I said AI tasks. Two generations after Nvidia introduced tensor AI cores for DLSS and more in its RTX 20-series GeForce GPUs, AMD is finally following suit. Each RDNA 3 Compute Unit (CU) packs a pair of AI cores, as well as an enhanced ray tracing core that supports new dedicated instructions, 1.5x more rays in flight, and fresh ray box sorting and transversal capabilities.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AMD RDNA 3 Radeon details\" class=\"wp-image-1370475\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rdna-3-ray-tracing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD says RDNA 3 offers up to 50 percent more performance per CU than RDNA 2 did, which feels unlikely to catch up to Nvidia&rsquo;s blistering RTX 40-series performance given the deficit AMD started in, but could make ray-traced games truly playable on RX 7000-series graphics cards. And you have to assume those AI cores will be put to work upsampling games before you know it&mdash;especially since Radeon chief Scott Herkelman teased FSR 3 for a 2023 release during this event, with a twofold increase in frame rates versus the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/919457/amd-fsr-1-0-vs-fsr-2-0.html\">already-impressive FSR 2</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of compute units, RDNA 3 might have a much smaller die, but it packs in many more CUs than before. The Radeon RX 6900 XT topped out at 80 CUs. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX has 96 running at 2.3GHz, while the 7900 XT offers 84 running at 2GHz.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AMD RDNA 3 Radeon details\" class=\"wp-image-1370477\" height=\"669\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AMD-RDNA-3-Radeon-RX-7900-XTX-render.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AMD RDNA 3 Radeon details\" class=\"wp-image-1370478\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AMD-RDNA-3-Radeon-RX-7900-XT-render.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>From traditional games to ray tracing to AI tasks, AMD&rsquo;s new flagship should offer substantially more performance than before, as the AMD-supplied slides below illustrate.

AMD also upgraded the media and display engines in RDNA 3.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AMD RDNA 3 Radeon details\" class=\"wp-image-1370469\" height=\"668\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rdna-3-display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT support DisplayPort 2.1, <em>unlike</em> the GeForce RTX 4090. That means it can support 4K displays at up to a blistering 480Hz, or 8K displays at 165Hz. And 12 color bits per channel unlocks up to 68 billion colors, which is welcome, but seems more like stat porn than something anyone other than content creators need to worry about.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AMD RDNA 3 Radeon details\" class=\"wp-image-1370473\" height=\"673\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/amd-rdna-3-media.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia and Intel hold the most sway with content creators, but AMD seriously upgraded its media engine with RDNA 3. Not only does it support AV1 encode and decode, joining Intel&rsquo;s Arc and Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 40-series, but the GPU can also run simultaneous encode and decode for HEVC or AVC video. Accelerating the media engine&rsquo;s frequency also helps it deliver up to 1.8x the performance of RDNA 2, Naffziger said, reducing export times. AMD&rsquo;s new AI cores also come to bear here, with Naffziger promising improved video encoding and conference call quality thanks to their help.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-brewing-battle\">A brewing battle</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX reveal\" class=\"wp-image-1370461\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AMD-RDNA-3-Radeon-RX-7900-XTX-7.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After several disheartening years of shortages and sky-high prices, PC gamers finally have something to look forward to. The GeForce RTX 4090 rocked our socks, but its $1,600 price tag makes it a luxury toy for the 0.1 percent. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT definitely aren&rsquo;t cheap, at $999 and $899 respectively, but they&rsquo;re a <em>whole lot less</em> than Nvidia&rsquo;s initial offerings&mdash;and they appear primed to deliver an enthralling 4K+ gaming experience of their own on the back of several exciting innovations and beefed-up ray tracing capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD&rsquo;s otherwise exciting presentation left us with plenty of questions, however. How will the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT stack up against the GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080, if not their own RDNA 2 predecessors? Does switching to multiple dies create any performance oddities? Will RDNA 3 finally deliver a compelling ray tracing experience? We&rsquo;ll need to wait for independent benchmarks when these new-breed graphics cards hit the streets on December 13 to find out the answers.</p>\nGaming, GPUs</div>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1370186/steam-for-chromeos-enters-beta-now-available-on-20-chromebooks.html", "title": "Steam for ChromeOS enters beta, now available on 20 Chromebooks", "date_published": "2022-11-03 16:00:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section><p>ChromeOS has a reputation for running on lightweight, affordable Chromebooks, but that seems to be shifting as of late.

In addition to improved notifications and storage management, the program is expanding its list of compatible hardware to include Core i3 and Ryzen 3-based devices.

Based on the usual release patterns, cheaper and less powerful Radeon 7000-based cards should be announced sometime next year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re also expecting Radeon 7000-series laptop cards at some point, possibly early in 2023, though they may not make an appearance at this event. </p>\nGPUs</div>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1370121/new-windows-powertoys-locksmith-tool.html", "title": "PowerToys now tells you which app is blocking file deletion", "date_published": "2022-11-03 14:35:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section><p>How often have you been in the middle of clearing off your desktop by deleting a bunch of unused files, only for Windows to tell you that it&rsquo;s in use by another program?

It tics off all the right boxes in terms of power, comfort, and durability. Let&rsquo;s dive right into the specs and features then. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The G502 Hero, which is powered by a Logitech Hero sensor, has 11 programmable buttons, a max DPI of 25,600, and RGB lighting. In other words, it&rsquo;s capable of responding quickly and is entirely customizable.  The peripheral is also quite comfortable thanks to its pill-shaped form. While it&rsquo;s not the lightest mouse out there at 121 grams, it&rsquo;s still a solid mouse that performs well. It&rsquo;s a phenomenal pick for serious gamers, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G502-Performance-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B07GBZ4Q68?pldnSite=1&amp;th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1369962-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Logitech G502 HERO wired gaming mouse for $34.99 at Amazon</a></p>\nMice</div>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1364305/keychron-q8-review-a-quality-keyboard-for-the-ergo-riche.html", "title": "Keychron Q8 review: This high-quality ergonomic keyboard feels delightful", "date_published": "2022-11-03 10:45:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section><div class=\"review\" id=\"review-body\"><img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"review-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" /><span class=\"review-title\">At a glance</span><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"experts-rating\">Expert's Rating</h3><div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n<div><div class=\"review-columns\"><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"pros\">Pros</h3><ul class=\"pros review-list\"><li>Unique Alice layout</li><li>Fantastic build quality </li><li>Easy customization</li></ul></div><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"cons\">Cons</h3><ul class=\"cons review-list\"><li>Steep learning curve</li></ul></div></div></div><h3 class=\"review-subTitle review-subTitle--borderTop\" id=\"our-verdict\">Our Verdict</h3><p class=\"verdict\">Keychron&rsquo;s Q series is once again impressive for quality and customization, now coming in the much-loved Alice layout.

Aside from some common-sense advice like &ldquo;get out of your chair once in a while&rdquo; and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t hunch over your laptop like Gollum slurping down fish guts,&rdquo; there aren&rsquo;t a lot of rules that are widely agreed upon to universally help. Everybody&rsquo;s different, and every body&rsquo;s different &mdash; if something feels good for you, then you should probably keep using it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that cynical prologue out of the way: the Keychron Q8. This design uses all of the same elements as Keychron&rsquo;s other excellent Q keyboards (<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/823922/keychron-q5-mechanical-keyboard-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">see our review of the Q5</a>) and applies it to the popular Alice layout, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.lightningkeyboards.com/work-pt4/tgr-alice&amp;xcust=2-2-1364305-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">featured on many boutiques builds</a>. This methodical key arrangement grants the keyboard a curve, as seen in many allegedly ergonomic designs, while keeping it compatible with standard MX switches and a variety of keycap sets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Keychron Q8 dial\" class=\"wp-image-1366118\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DSC09654.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&rsquo;s about all there is to say about it. The Q8 uses Keychron&rsquo;s excellent design chops for a keyboard that you&rsquo;ll either love, or find incredibly frustrating, depending on your adaptability and typing style. If you&rsquo;re in the former group, you&rsquo;ll appreciate that the Keychron Q8 is surprisingly cheap for all it offers, and it&rsquo;s one of the only Alice layout keyboards you can buy without getting on a waiting list.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-laundry-list-of-features\">A laundry list of features&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Keychron Q8 has all the features of the other members of the Q series. These include a huge and heavy milled aluminum body, built-in foam gaskets for quiet typing, hot-swap switches for customization, RGB lighting, high-quality PBT keycaps, and screw-in stabilizers.&nbsp;Inside the box you&rsquo;ll find a braided USB-C-to-C cable, a C-to-A adapter, puller tools for both keycaps and switches, an Allen wrench for opening the case, and some extra foam gaskets if you want more even padding. The keyboard supports the popular QMK and VIA standards for programming its keys and lights.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Keychron Q8 switches and keycaps\" class=\"wp-image-1366119\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DSC09620.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That last one will probably be essential for newer users of the Alice layout. Though this modified, more user-friendly version includes helpful additions like full arrow keys and a rotary dial for volume, you&rsquo;ll probably want to adjust things, like how to activate the function layer or precisely what&rsquo;s controlled by the rotary dial. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"learning-curve\">Learning curve&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subject: yes, this keyboard takes a lot of getting used to. More for me than for most users, I would guess, because I flunked out of middle school typing class. Despite my love of mechanical keyboards, my actual typing technique is atrocious; I developed a touch-typing style after years and years of hunting-and-pecking at 40WPM, with about 70 percent of my key presses coming from my dominant left hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Keychron Q8 right side\" class=\"wp-image-1366121\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DSC09605.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So for me, adjusting to a split layout requires more than simply accounting for the slight slant of the QWERTY area. I have to literally force myself to type &ldquo;correctly,&rdquo; keeping my fingers on the classical home rows, or else my index finger tries and fails to bridge the gap in the middle. Frankly I can only stand to do it for about an hour, then I have to go back to a regular layout in order to get my work done on time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Keychron Q8\" class=\"wp-image-1366117\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DSC09617.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But I stress, this is very much a &ldquo;me&rdquo; problem. The only real weakness of this version of the Alice layout is that in order to make room for the arrow cluster, it omits right Ctrl and Alt keys &mdash; if you can&rsquo;t switch to the left side you&rsquo;ll also find it frustrating. Those with more classically correct typing technique, whose fingers don&rsquo;t roam over a perfectly horizontal set of keys like a cartoon mouse dancing on a piano, will find it much easier to adjust. That&rsquo;s doubly true if you already use a split or ergonomic layout.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should mention, Keychron makes a slightly larger version of this keyboard with the same general layout, but the addition of a function row. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.keychron.com/pages/keychron-q10-customizable-mechanical-keyboard&amp;xcust=2-2-1364305-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">It&rsquo;s called the Q10</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"best-in-class-typing\">Best-in-class typing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond that very specific layout issue, the Keychron Q8 is as good as its stablemates. Tinkerers are free to add whatever kinds of switches they like to any of the individual keys, and program fun and interesting actions and lighting via, um, VIA or QMK firmware. (Just be aware of the odd 2/2 layer limitation because of the keyboard&rsquo;s built-in Mac/Windows switch.) You&rsquo;ll probably have to hunt around a bit for an Alice-compliant keycap set if you want a replacement, but the default doubleshot OSA keycaps are excellent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Keychron Q8 VIA programming\" class=\"wp-image-1366110\" height=\"765\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/programming.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If all you&rsquo;re looking for is a great typing experience, the Keychron Q8 delivers. It&rsquo;s hard to describe the difference between a high-quality board like this one and, say, a good but pedestrian model from Logitech or Razer. The keys almost glide with satisfying action, clicking down onto a base that feels like it was lovingly poured into a custom mold. The best analogy I can come up with is the difference between driving a budget Kia and a new BMW. They&rsquo;re both perfectly functional, but the latter is indefinably <em>more </em>car, in dozens of little but noticeable ways. Whether or not it&rsquo;s worth the difference in price is a subjective question. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"justified-expense\">Justified expense&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>And like its fellow Q keyboards, the Keychron Q8 is an expensive keyboard, but a shockingly good value in context. Prices start at $175 if you bring your own switches and keycaps, and top out at $205 for the version with Gateron G Pro switches, PBT keycaps, and the rotary knob. (Honestly, the most expensive version is the best deal, considering you&rsquo;ll probably spend double the difference on keycaps alone.) Cases come in black, silver, and blue, with matching keycap colors.
