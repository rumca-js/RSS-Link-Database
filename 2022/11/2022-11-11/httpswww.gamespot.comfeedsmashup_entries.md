<p dir="ltr">From humble RetroPie setups to the pricey Analogue Pocket, retro gaming boxes are big business these days. The current crop of gaming consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X are great machines in their own right, but they don't offer much in the way of retro goodness--especially compared to standalone emulators. As such, if you're looking to revisit the past on your TV, building a dedicated retro box is probably the right move.</p><p dir="ltr">If you pay any attention to this sort of thing, you're probably familiar with RetroPie, the Raspberry Pi-supported software that allows you to play generations of retro games with a cheap build. Indeed, even the fanciest Pi-based build is probably going to run you in the neighborhood of $100, which makes it a great option for gamers on a budget. However, if you're looking to build a truly enthusiast-grade machine--and you don't mind dropping a bit of cash on it--you should consider putting together a MiSTer FPGA. Although it's a hardcore machine, even the least technically inclined gamer can put it together.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>MiSTer magic</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Strictly speaking, MiSTer is an open-source project that births new life into classic consoles on modern hardware, as well as arcade machines. However, whereas software emulators have tiny inaccuracies and mistakes that experts can detect, a MiSTer uses FPGA technology (field-programmable gate arrays) to mimic the console on a per-cycle level. This makes it essentially identical to the real console--it's as if your mom never sold your SNES to that big-box retailer for $25.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-build-a-mister-the-ultimate-retro-gaming-box/1100-6509064/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Kevin Conroy Defined Batman For All Those That Followed

<p dir="ltr">James Bond fans will argue until they're blue in the face which actor is the best 007. But when it comes to Batman, there is no argument: Kevin Conroy, who voiced Batman for nearly 30 years beginning with Batman: The Animated Series, is unquestionably the best. On this, Batman fans are in near universal agreement. Conroy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/batman-voice-actor-kevin-conroy-has-died/1100-6509107/">passed away this week</a> at age 66, but leaves behind a permanent mark on the legendary comic book hero.</p><p dir="ltr">When Conroy stepped into the role, Batman had already been around for over half a century, and already had two iconic live-action performances in Adam West and Michael Keaton. In fact the timing of the series made it almost look like a cash-in on Tim Burton's 1989 Batman film. But the work that artist Bruce Timm, writer Paul Dini, and voice actor Kevin Conroy did with the character swept those portrayals and those that would follow right off the board.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not that any of the other actors who have played the character are <em>bad</em>. Nearly every one of them brings something fresh to the role. But Conroy's voice work helped to define Batman and Bruce Wayne as separate, individual people.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kevin-conroy-defined-batman-for-all-those-that-followed/1100-6509108/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Kevin Conroy, the voice of Batman for several generations of fans, has passed away at the age of 66. Conroy's death was first reported by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/diane.pershing/posts/pfbid02ZMbyF3SyGKwLJu2qKAnrP4ULZMbxNvFccU3e2f7bKU86uJhTPmpUpzCASb32J2VJl">Diane Pershing</a>, who played Poison Ivy in Batman: The Animated Series, and Warner Bros. Animation officially confirmed the news today.</p><p>Conroy rose to fame as the voice of the caped crusader in the 1990s Batman animated series, a role that he would go on to reprise across several DC Universe cartoons, films, and video games over the decades. Considered to be the definitive Batman voice actor, Conroy's take on the dark knight also featured in films such as Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, Justice League, and Rocksteady's groundbreaking Arkham trilogy of video games.</p><p>"Kevin was far more than an actor whom I had the pleasure of casting and directing--he was a dear friend for 30+ years whose kindness and generous spirit knew no boundaries," casting director Andrea Romano said in a Warner Bros. press release. "Kevin’s warm heart, delightfully deep laugh and pure love of life will be with me forever."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/batman-voice-actor-kevin-conroy-has-died/1100-6509107/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The 8BitDo Ultimate Is Even Better Than The Switch Pro Controller

<p dir="ltr">Third-party controller manufacturer 8BitDo has released no shortage of great controllers for Nintendo Switch and other platforms, but many of them fall into the category of "situational" options–controllers that are ideal for certain games and genres. The <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9BDMWWN?tag=gamespotdeals-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Switch controller</a> </span> is a different beast. Not only does it have superb ergonomics, pro-style features, and customization galore, but it also comes with a charging stand and can connect via Bluetooth or 2.4GHz.</p><p dir="ltr">The robust feature set makes the 8BitDo Ultimate the priciest traditional gamepad from the manufacturer yet at $70. Yet, that's the same price as <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0?tag=gamespotdeals-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp">Nintendo&#039;s official Pro controller.</a> </span> For the first time since the Switch launched five years ago, there's a controller for docked mode that surpasses the Pro controller. If you're looking for a new Switch controller, the 8BitDo Ultimate is the one to buy.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the obvious reasons why the 8BitDo Ultimate is an excellent alternative to the Switch Pro controller is its form factor and button layout. The Ultimate has the same general layout with offset sticks and ergonomic handles. Prior to the Ultimate, 8BitDo's premium Switch controllers <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Wireless-Bluetooth-Classic-Joystick/dp/B07B3RWW1F?tag=gamespotdeals-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp">(such as the Pro 2)</a> </span> had aligned joysticks like PlayStation controllers. The Pro 2 was and still is great for many types of games, but its form factor made it excel particularly with retro games. The Ultimate is slightly more compact than Nintendo's Pro controller, though it still feels natural to use, even as someone who has spent five years with the Pro controller. That said, if you have large hands, it may take some getting used to or feel a bit cramped compared to the Pro controller or even an Xbox controller.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-8bitdo-ultimate-is-even-better-than-the-switch-pro-controller/1100-6509103/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
