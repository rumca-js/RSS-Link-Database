<p>At the heart of this subversive frontier tale is a sumptuous but doomed love story. That’s what makes it the renowned TV writer’s most radical and pleasurable work yet</p><p>Though born in Henley-on-Thames, Hugo Blick could have been a cowboy. Aged 18, his concerned parents decided he needed to have his waywardness ironed out of him. He was packed off to Montana and put under the tutelage of a family friend who happened to be an avid outdoorsman and former US air force captain.</p><p>“I was thought to need a stabilising influence,” recalls the 57-year-old writer, director and actor over video call from New York. The air force captain taught Blick how to shoot and hunt. “Apologies to any vegans out there,” he says. He also learned how to spin a horse. Even in the late 80s, Montana was a wilder west than anything on the M4 corridor. “Winters where temperatures go below -60F are not unusual and life out there can be hard. The ghosts of the harshness of the frontier of the 1890s still haunted the place, at least for me.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/11/hugo-blick-on-making-the-english-emily-blunt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Brave Blossoms have perfect armoury to exploit any overeagerness from wounded hosts to impress at Twickenham</p><p>Eddie Jones had just announced his team for /Saturday’s match against Japan when he sat down to field questions, scanned the room and caught sight of Ayumu Goromaru in the far corner. To recap, Goromaru was the goal-kicking full-back when Jones led the Brave Blossoms <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/19/south-africa-japan-rugby-world-cup-2015-match-report">to the 2015 victory over South Africa</a> which put in motion his appointment as England’s head coach a few months later.</p><p>Jones’s eyes lit up when he clocked Goromaru – glorified in Japan to the extent there was a lifesize bronze statue made in his honour and a baby giraffe named after him at Hamamatsu zoo – before slipping into Japanese with his former charge, in the room doing broadcast work. Here was both a reminder of Jones’s relationship with the country and of how and when he entered into English rugby’s wider consciousness seven years ago. Owen Farrell was reflecting on it this week too, recalling how he was listening to “the Brighton Miracle” on the radio before dashing in the front door to catch the final few moments on television.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/11/joness-england-face-challenge-to-liberate-themselves-against-japan">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jason Momoa goes full Johnny Depp as the larger-than-life guide to a dreamworld in a mostly entertaining family fantasy</p><p>The fantastical world of dreams proves to be predictably fertile territory for an extravagant adventure for kids in Netflix’s big-budget big bet Slumberland, an imaginative and mostly agreeable adaptation of an early 20th-century comic strip centered around the character of Little Nemo. Created by cartoonist Winsor McCay, Nemo would find himself visiting bold and surreal new worlds in his sleep and here we meet him as a her, newcomer Marlow Barkley, living in a lighthouse on a remote island with her father, played by Kyle Chandler.</p><p>It’s an eye-grabbing location, the first of many, and early on it’s clear we are in the often tight-fisted streamer’s lofty A class, the film carrying a rare $150m budget. Director Francis Lawrence, best known for commandeering the majority of the Hunger Games series, is a canny and confident tour guide, ushering us from one strange set-piece to the next as Nemo follows in her dream-travelling father’s footsteps after his death. She’s forced to live with her estranged uncle (Chris O’Dowd) and forced out of her untenable family home. In her dreams she meets Flip (Jason Momoa), someone her father used to travel with in his sleep, and he tells her of a myth, a pearl that would allow her to control her dreams, and the two embark on a quest to find it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/11/netflix-slumberland-review-jason-momoa">Continue reading...</a>

<p>White port, arrack, orange liqueur and white tea combine in this punchy update on the classic Jerry Thomas</p><p>The word punch has its origins in the Sanskrit <em>panch</em>, meaning “five”. Traditionally, a punch is made with no more and no fewer than five ingredients: a spirit (commonly arrack, rum or gin), sugar, water, fruit and spice. This one has been on Hoppers’ drinks list since we first opened in 2015, and is a twist on the classic Jerry Thomas from way back in 1840. It’s a great one for when you have people round, and works both as an aperitif and alongside food. We cold brew our tea, to extract the best floral and aromatic flavours, rather than the bitterness and tannins you get from a hot infusion. The process takes eight to 12 hours, so you’ll need to prepare ahead.</p><p>This is an edited extract from Hoppers: The Cookbook – Recipes, Memories and Inspiration from Sri Lankan Homes, Streets and Beyond, by Karan Gokani, published by Quadrille at £30.

For most of his fans they probably will, because no one does relatable observational comedy better than Kay.

<p>After a lockdown hiatus, high heels are back – which means taking baby steps as we learn how to walk in them all over again</p><p>I recently spent a week watching women fall over. I didn’t plan to spend Paris fashion week that way but that is mostly how I remember it. At show after show, the moment that snagged in my mind, playing back on a loop, was a model losing her balance and toppling, or snapping a heel and stumbling, or having to kick off a pair of impossible shoes and hold them in her hand while walking the runway barefoot. <br /><br />At Vivienne Westwood’s show, it was the exaggerated platforms that made the shoes impossible to walk in. A platform sole is a useful trick for adding height without tipping you forward at a vertiginous angle. But when there is more than an inch or two of platform, your connection with the ground disappears and you lose the instinct for which part of your foot needs to take your weight, for balance.</p><p>Stepping down from a platform, a willowy model tottered on one towering shoe, rocking in gentle circles like a skittle. For a moment she stilled, and then a Bambi leg crumpled beneath her as she hit the floor, just like Naomi Campbell famously did <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/celebrities/news/a32278838/naomi-campbell-catwalk-fall/" title="">in 1993</a>. One way or another, there were more falls than a Laurel and Hardy film. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/nov/11/heels-are-on-the-rise-and-im-ready-to-fall-for-them-again-literally">Continue reading...</a>

Ballots are still being counted three days after Tuesday’s midterms, and it seems like Democrats may have a shot at taking control of the Senate again.

They insisted that the surge in new voter registrations among women was a fluke, or irrelevant.</p><p>Ahead of the election, it became conventional wisdom among a kind of self-serious, mostly male political commentator to insist that not only were the Democrats doomed, they had doomed themselves, specifically, by talking about abortion too much. The party had dragged itself down with a social issue that was ultimately not very important, we were told. The Democrats were going to lose, and it was going to be because they had spent too much time catering to the flighty and unserious demands of feminists.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/11/abortion-important-election-issue-wrong">Continue reading...</a>

Why is my country going back to the dark ages?</a></p><p>Abortions on television can be funny. They are sometimes heartbreaking or traumatic. They might help educate a woman watching at home who wants to make an informed decision about her own abortion. They can be all of these things and more – all that’s important is that they are normalised. But if you’ve ever watched a US TV show with an abortion storyline, there’s a good chance that it would play out very differently if it were written today.</p><p>Take the latest series of Katori Hall’s hit strip club drama, P-Valley. In an episode that aired on 24 July this year, Mercedes (Brandee Evans) drives her 14-year-old pregnant daughter Terricka (Azaria Carter) to the only abortion clinic in Mississippi, talking through her options on the way. They walk past anti-abortion protestors outside the clinic. “So, you just gonna suck it out?” Terricka asks nervously. “If that’s what you decide,” the nurse replies. After 24 hours, she goes ahead with the procedure. At the time of production this was a realistic, if precarious, reflection of life in a US state where it was legal to get an abortion up to 15 weeks of pregnancy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/11/from-brunch-chat-in-sex-and-the-city-to-an-excuse-for-a-party-in-girls-50-years-of-abortion-on-tv">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Got something to ask the film and theatre director? Send it our way and we’ll put it to him</p><p>Three and a half decades into a career arguably more storied than that of any other British film and theatre director, Sam Mendes continues to push boundaries. In fact, he has just chalked up a professional first: his debut solo original screenplay. The project? <em>Empire of Light</em>, a hymn to the magic of cinema, also directed by Mendes, starring Olivia Colman, Toby Jones and Colin Firth. The film will hit our screens in January, a big month for Mendes, which will also see the return to the West End of his acclaimed production of <em><a href="https://lwtheatres.co.uk/whats-on/the-lehman-trilogy/?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAmaibBhCAARIsAKUlaKSAUvL88ZOjcBjWKwfmPfkLflpiit_vvzn_RfwH4-099ySYXQhK5ZAaAvClEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">The Lehman Trilogy</a></em>, fresh from a Tony award-winning run on Broadway.</p><p>As a young man, Mendes was more interested in cricket than drama. But he developed a passion for theatre at Cambridge University and stepped into the role of artistic director at the Donmar Warehouse just three years after graduating. His lauded productions of Stephen Sondheim’s <em>Assassins</em>, <em>Cabaret</em> and David Hare’s <em>The Blue Room</em>, for which he brought Nicole Kidman to the London stage, drew the attention of Hollywood. His debut movie, <em>American Beauty</em>, won five Oscars in 1999.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/nov/11/send-us-your-questions-for-sam-mendes">Continue reading...</a>

In my mind, though, I was feeling fear and panic rising inside me. My wife was about to cry.

## ‘It’s an ugly, lovely thing’: Wales, the World Cup and the bucket hat uniting a nation

<p>Wales have made it to their first World Cup since 1958! There’s only one icon of this great sporting renaissance, and it’s not Gareth Bale …</p><p>Every generation of Welsh football fans finds their own special moment of heartbreak. I wasn’t alive to witness the great robbery of 1977 when a Maradona-grade handball decision sent Scotland to the 1978 World Cup at our expense<strong> </strong>and I was a touch too young to have my hopes and dreams brutally crushed by Paul Bodin’s missed penalty of 1993, which would have taken us to USA 94. Instead, I had to wait for 2003 at the Millennium Stadium, watching Wales take on Russia for a spot at the 2004 Euros. It was a match so drab that our fans started chanting “USA, USA, USA”, as though all we had to get excited about was the cold war. In the end, that chant turned out to be weirdly prescient. A few days after our 0-1 defeat, one of the Russian players, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/06/wales-yegor-titov-euro-2004-russia" title="">Yegor Titov, tested positive for Bromantan</a>, a cold war-era drug allegedly used by the Russian military to give their troops extra stamina. The Welsh FA protested to Uefa, but the result was not overturned and so a new age of Wales supporters had their defining moment of pain.</p><p>Roman Igbagari and Louis Morris-Tarrant, both 11: ‘We love wearing the hats because they are fun and support the Welsh side.

<p>Nearly 50 years since their only album was recorded, the group are achieving international acclaim thanks to a renewed interest in a music that speaks to something more than just a love of the Lord</p><p>In 1975, a group of teenage siblings in Aberdeen, Mississippi, recorded an album of gospel songs focused on toil, conflict, succour and redemption. They named themselves the Staples Jr Singers in tribute to Mavis and co, their Mississippi forebears, because “a lot of Staples songs had a meaning to them”, says Annie Caldwell (then Annie Brown). She was 14 when they released When Do We Get Paid, although the album’s title track could serve as an anthem for any adult who finds themselves overworked and under-compensated.</p><p>They made 500 copies of the album, which they sold at performances and in their front yard. Once they sold out, they didn’t consider pressing more. “We were busy getting on with life,” says Edward Brown (their brother ARC completed the group). “Gospel was something we sang because we love to praise the Lord. Not some kind of show business.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/11/gospel-trailblazers-the-staples-jr-singers-we-were-singing-about-all-the-hardship-and-hurt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A department store’s sentimental commercials have somehow become a yuletide institution. Will this year’s offering make it into our Top 10? And what’s No 1?</p><p>For 12 years, the John Lewis Christmas advert has been the UK’s signal to commence festive operations. What a magnificent tradition this has become. Every year, come November, everyone gathers around their social media platform of choice and watches a person or a thing do something bittersweet and completely unrelated to the workings of a modern-day department store, while some poor wisp bleats out a slowed-down, acoustic version of a song that everyone previously thought was a banger. And then they spend the rest of the day arguing with strangers about how much it made them cry. It is beautiful.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/10/john-lewis-christmas-advert-2022-the-most-unapologetically-depressing-thing-in-human-history">This year’s advert</a> has just dropped: a man learning to skateboard to bond with his foster child.

Yet behind the imposing facade are some playful and surprising touches.</p><p>In one room, a painting hangs at a crooked angle. In another, a luminous green cat sits menacingly in a cage with the door ajar. Elsewhere, a wall “comes to life” as an eerie curtain of rustling leaves.

<p>MP wants to show us his human side but his appearance so far has sucked the joy out of the show</p><p><strong>Matt is still toxic</strong>. The first reaction of the comedian Seann Walsh said it all. He saw Matt Hancock and he burst out laughing. As if he’d just come across the last person he’d want to meet. Others weren’t so kind. The Corrie actor Sue Cleaver reckoned he shouldn’t be skiving off when parliament wasn’t in recess. The singer Boy George said that if his mum had died of Covid he would have walked out of the camp. The former rugby player Mike Tindall observed that Matt just talked “bullshit, bullshit, bullshit”. The radio DJ Chris Moyles looked as if he wanted to throw up. The rest didn’t say much. The least hostile response came from the Hollyoaks actor Owen Warner. But then he didn’t appear to know who Matt was. By day two some of the camp had relaxed a little: as if they had made a decision to try to get along with him in the interests of harmony. But several clearly dislike him intensely. Imagine. </p><p><strong>Matt is just trying to be human</strong>. At least that’s what he keeps telling us. He wants us to see the real Matt. The Matt behind the politician’s mask. The man behind the podium, as he self-importantly put it. The guy who wanted to understand economics, so he went to work in the Bank of England, before going on to become an adviser to George Osborne. The everyday story of an ordinary bloke who just happened to become a cabinet minister. So what he’s doing on I’m a Celeb – other than trousering £400K: it’s astonishing how no one ever mentions they are in it for the dosh – is something of a mystery. The last place any sane person would expect to be real is on a reality show. But Matt is arrogant and delusional enough to think he can beat the system. Either that or he’s never watched the show. I’m a Celeb is one of the most sadistic shows on TV and the only reason Matt has been brought on is to be the hate figure against whom the country can unite. A thought: why would Matt imagine anyone was that interested in his human side? He’s actually rather dull.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/11/things-weve-learned-about-matt-hancock-im-a-celebrity">Continue reading...</a>

I didn’t actually end up playing it, but sometimes you find things that just excite you, and that was one of those. It’s really energetic, exciting and fun. And it’s fast. Sometimes I play drum’n’bass in my sets, but not that often, it really depends on the venue and the event. I’m always excited when there is an event coming up where I think: “I can really do this here”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/11/helena-hauffs-listening-diary-i-feel-so-grown-up-listening-to-jazz-while-cooking">Continue reading...</a>

There, we sit around a table and earnestly arrange small wooden pieces. We shuffle shiny cards dense with type. We lay out elaborate cardboard tiles that fit together like puzzle pieces.

The most powerful wins.</p><p>Designed by Ben Brode, one of the co-creators of Hearthstone, Marvel Snap is a fresh take on the genre, in which players build collections of superheroes, each with different power ratings, and battle with a human or AI opponent to control three locations in the middle of the game board. The beauty is in the stripped-down simplicity of the interface: there are only six turns in each game, and only four cards can be placed at each location. As rounds progress, participants are able to place more powerful heroes. The player whose cards dominate the greatest number of play spaces at the end of the sixth round takes the match.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/nov/11/marvel-snap-review-superhero-showdown-card-game-is-utterly-compulsive">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(BMG)<br /></strong>This second solo album from the former boyband member, rooted in 00s indie and festival rock, is derivative to the point of full-on mimicry</p><p>Louis Tomlinson has always felt like the scrappiest member of One Direction. While his former co-workers found specific lanes, he juggled genres, trying everything from EDM to guitar-led Oasis cosplay. His first solo album, Walls, lacked identity as a result: falling back on maudlin balladry and lager-swilling lad rock, it was forgettable and aimless.</p><p>Faith in the Future attempts to address this. Firmly rooted in early 00s indie and festival rock, it’s more sonically assured. Tomlinson himself, however, is now lost in a sea of influences. On Bigger Than Me, a Snow Patrol-like singalong, a rumbling storm of drums threatens to overpower Tomlinson’s thin vocals, while on Face the Music, propulsive and crunching guitars provide more fuel than his affected attempt at a Gallagher snarl.

<p>For years, the superteam model has dominated the NBA.

The performance artist – a self-proclaimed “drag terrorist” – unleashes an unfiltered and filthy combination of throbbing electronic music and between-song patter, whether <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/23/christeene-review-barbican-london">performing at London’s Barbican</a> or in a dive bar. She looks a bit like a lost swamp creature, all ripped clothes and smudges of kohl. This is not the high femme, precisely arched brow of RuPaul’s Drag Race. In fact, Christeene bristles against being called a drag queen at all. “I find it very hard and very cheap to have that label put on me,” she says in her languid, southern drawl. Instead, Paul Soileau has used Christeene as a vessel for both rage and humour for more than a decade.</p><p>She is known for kicking off about celebrity culture, the religious right, and hyper-consumerism. “There’s so much to talk about,” especially as another recession looms and political polarisation solidifies.

<p><strong>(Carrying Colour)<br /></strong>The pianist’s meditative solos are mutilated by multiple effects pedals, drones, voices and even birdsong – but it only adds to the mystery</p><p>One would hope that the profile of the pianist and composer Duval Timothy might rise exponentially after his high-profile production work on Kendrick Lamar’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/21/kendrick-lamar-mr-morale-and-the-big-steppers-review">Mr Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</a>. This former art student – who dresses only in blue (in fealty to the signage in his home borough of Lewisham), co-wrote a cookbook of African recipes and currently lives between London and Freetown, Sierra Leone – has been making consistently excellent music for a long time. His quizzical piano miniatures have been sampled by Loyle Carner, Solange and Mount Kimbie; he has collaborated with the likes of David Okumu and Rosie Lowe; and his new album, Meeting With a Judas Tree, is accompanied by a short film which shows at the ICA, London, this weekend.</p><p>Judas Tree takes Timothy’s meditative piano solos and mutilates them using effects pedals, wonky synths and field recordings, often with help from likeminded sound artists. On opening track Plunge, a whimsical piano sequence is overlaid with buzzing distortion to the point where it starts to resemble a Jesus &amp; Mary Chain track. Wood, a ruminative piano duet with Chinese-Canadian sound artist Yu Su, is lavished with birdsong and squeaking sound effects until it positively sparkles. On the nine-minute epic Mutate, a synth wobbles over a cluster of jazzy piano chords and what sound like sighing guitars, which are gradually multi-tracked and distorted to create a disorientating babble of atonal voices. Thunder is a seven-and-a-half-minute collaboration with London musician Fauzia, where piano is placed through multiple FX chambers and resonant drones. Timothy’s brand of minimalism is simple but hugely satisfying: this disruptive approach introduces a new layer of mystery and randomness to already beautiful music.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/11/duval-timothy-meeting-with-a-judas-tree-review">Continue reading...</a>

Afterwards, Guardiola said: “I want Jack to have the responsibility, to play with Kevin [De Bruyne] with Phil [Foden]. I want Jack to get the ball to attack the back line. We talk to him – that the first intention is to score a goal. And today the body language is that the first intention is to score a goal and after to pass.

<p>From Taxi Driver to Bullitt, the director in full flow on his favourite movies</p><p>Are we really going to need the audiobook version? From the very first page, the author’s unmistakable voice ricochets between the reader’s ears: giggling, provoking, digressing, seducing and dropping deadpan little hints about his own life.<br /><br />Oscar-winning screenwriter and director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/quentintarantino" title="">Quentin Tarantino</a> has published his first work of movie criticism, a study of his personal favourites from the New American Cinema era, including superb, boisterous pieces on Peter Yates’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/19/bullitt-yates-action" title="">Bullitt</a>, John G Avildsen’s Joe<em>, </em>Don Siegel’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/23/dirty-harry-clint-eastwood-70s-antihero" title="">Dirty Harry</a>, John Boorman’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/30/deliverance-1972-film-john-boorman-anniversary" title="">Deliverance</a>, Sam Peckinpah’s The Getaway, Peter Bogdanovich’s Daisy Miller, Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and Sylvester Stallone’s Paradise Alley. Just as with his recent novel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/29/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-tarantinos-debut-novel-shines" title="">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a> – based on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/21/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-tarantino-dazzling-dicaprio-pitt" title="">his own film</a> of the same title – Tarantino unleashes a trivia torrent, forcing you to stand fully clothed under his personal Niagara of cinephile references.<br /><br />It’s exasperating at first. But as so often in the past, I fell under Tarantino’s eerie spell. His passionate knowledge of movies and TV is amazing and slightly terrifying. This kind of engagement is on a level that few ever reach. Among Brit film-makers, only Edgar Wright can match Tarantino’s superhuman encyclopedism.<br /><br />Despite the title, there’s not much that’s speculative about it. The keynote is cheerful, resounding certainty. Having said which, he does indulge in some expert what-if fantasising about how films could have been made another way, particularly Taxi Driver. He hates the Bernard Herrmann music, describing it as “the minimalist car noise – asshole with a sax – score Hermann pawned off on Scorsese”. Tarantino also thinks it’s important to understand that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/robertdeniro" title="">Robert De Niro</a>’s character Travis Bickle was never actually in Vietnam at all because a real Vietnam veteran would not be so wary of and ignorant about Black people. He says it was cowardly to turn the Black pimp of Paul Schrader’s original script into a white man (though conceding the brilliance of Harvey Keitel’s performance) and wonders aloud how it might have played differently with other mooted directors: Richard Mulligan or Brian De Palma, or with the studio’s first pick, Jeff Bridges, in the lead.</p><p><br />Yet Tarantino’s insights, brazen and brilliant as they always are, are weirdly upstaged by the tiny, unfollowed-up hints he drops about his own psyche – which comprise the ostensible “memoir” part of the book. Tarantino doesn’t talk about his father Tony’s absence from his life but says at the age of seven, he was taken by his mother and stepfather to see the highly adult film Joe in a double bill. The other film, for the record, was Carl Reiner’s comedy Where’s Poppa?

<p>Britten’s opera is a strange, unsettling and unbearably private piece.

Much of this power comes from its intense intimacy: writing for much smaller forces than the “grand opera” Peter Grimes that preceded this work, Benjamin Britten uses virtuosic vocal writing and eerie orchestral textures to weave together a hard-hitting, atmospheric theatre work that sounds and feels unlike anything else in the repertory.</p><p>The Rape of Lucretia premiered at Glyndebourne in 1946 in a staging with studiously “Roman” designs by <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/john-piper-1774">John Piper</a> that artfully and deliberately created distance between creator and subject matter.

<p>The rock singer talks about getting his band back on track, becoming a parent – and how he learned to stop playing the troll in interviews</p><p>If you have ever paid attention to the Smashing Pumpkins, you know that Billy Corgan is a famously self-important rock star: the type who talks at length to the press about how great he is and then complains about being misquoted. We are in a Manhattan hotel, discussing how Corgan came to realise that his lifelong pursuit of music – and the undeniable success that had come with it – had left him unfulfilled, when he says this: “I would watch people quite cleverly try to disassemble what I’d actually built. They were sort of interested in separating me from my own true narrative.”</p><p>Now, this reads like something a famously self-important rock star would say. But Corgan says it playfully, with such self-awareness that he gets away with it: suggesting that he knows this is absurd, but it’s how he feels, and actually it’s even appropriate given his stature; that he’d rather risk ridicule than minimise his feelings. Some version of this dynamic repeats constantly over the next hour. Irony may not always be a healthy coping device, but having fun with an interview seems like the least a rock star should do. I wondered how differently many of his previously controversial quotes – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/20/billy-corgan-compares-social-justice-warriors-kkk">about social justice warriors</a>, a pizza fast-food chain, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/billy-corgan-and-smash-mouth-are-fighting-over-shrek-2367827">the Shrek soundtrack</a> – might read in the context of their delivery.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/11/smashing-pumpkins-billy-corgan-i-dont-want-my-kids-growing-up-with-a-has-been-father">Continue reading...</a>

## Cop27: the future is solar, but it won’t be simple – podcast

<p>As Joe Biden arrives at Cop27 in Egypt, he comes with a good story to tell on America’s transition to renewable energy. But on the ground in rural Indiana where the country’s biggest solar plant is being built, things are getting nasty. Oliver Milman reports</p><p>Pulaski county, Indiana is flat, sunny and full of farmland. For decades its farmers have produced cobs of golden yellow corn. But now the area is being earmarked to produce something else: energy. Its famers are being offered a guaranteed income to use their land to host America’s largest solar power farm. It’s an offer many are keen to take up.</p><p>The Guardian’s US environment correspondent, <strong>Oliver Milman</strong>,<strong> </strong>tells <strong>Hannah Moore </strong>that when fully operational, the solar farm will be able to power up to 250,000 households. But not everyone is onboard. Attempts to get the power flowing have been disrupted by an increasingly bitter campaign from opponents who believe the solar panels to be an eyesore, a threat to their way of life and for some (without evidence), a conspiracy that would fry birdlife and intoxicate the soil. Lawyers on both sides are involved and progress has been painfully slow.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/nov/11/cop27-the-future-is-solar-but-it-wont-be-simple-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ukraine estimates it will take at least a week for Russian troops to leave Kherson city; Kyiv claims liberation of the key town of Snihurivka</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Read all our Ukraine coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>Ukrainian forces are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/10/ukraine-capture-snihurivka-kherson-russia-war">closing in on the outskirts of the southern city of Kherson</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/10/ukraine-capture-snihurivka-kherson-russia-war"> </a>after Russia’s announcement its forces have begun retreating. Ukraine claimed it had liberated the key town of Snihurivka, about 20 miles (32km) north of Kherson. Images also emerged of Ukrainian soldiers with a Ukrainian flag in Kyslivka, a village just outside Klapaya and about nine miles (15km) from Kherson’s city centre.</p><p><strong>The Russian defence ministry confirmed its withdrawal in the region was under way.</strong> “The Russian troop units are manoeuvring to a prepared position on the left bank of the Dnipro River in strict accordance with the approved plan.”</p><p><strong>Ukrainian troops continued their advance on Kherson from </strong>the north, east and west, as the large pocket around the city once held by Russian forces appeared to be shrinking. Video posted by Russian soldiers retreating across the Dnipro appeared to confirm that at least some troops had already withdrawn.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s defence minister said Russians will take at least a week to leave Kherson city and Moscow still had a contingent of 40,000 troops in the Kherson region</strong>. “It’s not that easy to withdraw these troops from Kherson in one day or two days. As a minimum, (it will take) one week,” Oleksii Reznikov told Reuters. He added that intelligence showed Russia’s forces remained inside the city, around the city and on the west bank of the Dnipro. Vadym Skibitsky, Ukraine’s deputy military intelligence chief, estimated more than half the Russian forces that had been stationed on the right bank of the city were still there – a force that had previously been put at 20,000.</p><p><strong>Kyiv has said it is wary of rushing in and claiming victory, warning it may be a trap by the Kremlin. </strong>Ukraine’s army chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said Kyiv could not yet confirm whether Russia was indeed pulling out of the city, but Kyiv’s forces have advanced 36.5km (22.7 miles) and retaken 41 villages and towns since 1 October in the region. That included 12 settlements on Wednesday alone.</p><p><strong>There were unconfirmed reports of explosions from shelling around the Nova Kakhovka dam late on Thursday.</strong> Kyiv has repeatedly warned that the 30-metre high hydroelectric facility could be targeted by the Russians.</p><p><strong>Ukrainian forces have liberated 41 settlements as they advanced through the south</strong>, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his Thursday evening address. Ukraine is working on ridding areas retaken from Russian forces of thousands of unexploded landmines and ordnance that has been left behind.</p><p><strong>America’s top general and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, estimates that Russia’s military had seen more than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/10/us-estimates-200000-military-casualties-all-sides-ukraine-war">100,000 of its soldiers killed and wounded in Ukraine</a></strong>, adding that Kyiv’s armed forces has “probably” suffered a similar level of casualties. Mark Milley’s remarks offer the highest US estimate of casualties to date.</p><p><strong>The UK government has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/10/uk-sanctions-18bn-russian-owned-assets-ukraine">frozen more than £18bn of assets </a>belonging to oligarchs and other Russians</strong> under the new sanctions regime.

According to the Pentagon, the aid package will contain large amounts of ammunition and, for the first time, four highly mobile Avenger air defence systems. “This increased air defence will be critical for Ukraine as Russia continues to use cruise missiles and Iranian-made drones to attack critical civilian infrastructure,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. The US will also buy 100,000 rounds of howitzer artillery from South Korean manufacturers to provide to Ukraine, an official added.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/11/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-261-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
