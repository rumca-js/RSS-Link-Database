  <p id="ZxEcmV">Meta is pulling the plug on its Portal video calling smart displays and its two remaining unreleased smartwatch projects, my colleague Alex Heath can confirm, as the company cuts 11,000 jobs including many in tech divisions. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-parent-meta-winding-down-some-non-core-hardware-projects-2022-11-11/?taid=636eb57e61b9590001774d21&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter"><em>Reuters </em>reported</a> earlier today that the company planned to kill off both Portal and smartwatches, citing Meta execs who spoke at a town hall meeting; we heard the same thing from other sources, so we can independently corroborate the news.</p>

  <p id="oUnvub">Actor Rainn Wilson (you might know him as Dwight from <em>The Office</em>) had a grand scheme to bring his hilarious brand of climate advocacy to Twitter this week. That plan, however, was	quickly thwarted — another victim of the name-changing drama that has flourished on the platform recently. </p>
<p id="GMoWjW">Wilson took to Twitter on Wednesday to announce he was changing his name on social media to “Rainnfall Heat Wave Extreme Winter Wilson.” “As a cheap little stunt to help save planet Earth I’ve changed my name on Twitter, Instagram, and even on my fancy writing paper,” Wilson said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/rainnwilson/status/1590425448227704833">video</a>. He points to a memo pad with scrawled changes to his printed name, so that it reads “Acid Rainn Kills Trees Wilson.” </p>

  <p id="9X8HHM">When Apple first launched Cycle Tracking for periods in its Health app, the feature was fairly basic. It didn’t do much besides let you log your period — and even then, you couldn’t log factors like pregnancy or birth control. However, the company recently added advanced features that can help retroactively identify when a person ovulates and detect cycle deviations. </p>
<p id="4ad0Uo">While these tools might be helpful, it’s understandable if you’re leery of sharing biometric information for <em>this</em> particular purpose in the post-Roe era. If that’s the case, you can easily disable those features.</p>
<p id="v9Je4q">Apple’s retrospective ovulation estimates are based on temperature data. That means you need an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23353756/apple-watch-series-8-review-smartwatch-wearables">Apple Watch Series 8</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23363948/apple-watch-ultra-review-rugged-smartwatch-gps">Ultra</a>, which are currently the only Apple...</p>

  <p id="pAuDpI">The day has finally come: famed pokémon trainer Ash Ketchum is the very best. The moment, 25 seasons in the making, happened earlier this morning in the latest episode of the Netflix series <em>Pokémon Ultimate Journeys</em>, when Ash won the “Masters Eight Tournament of the Pokémon World Coronation Series,” making him the top trainer in the world. The episode aired first in Japan and will be coming to the rest of the world “in the future.”</p>

## Twitter reactivated the ‘Official’ gray check for accounts that are actually verified

  <p id="z7vUd9">Okay, so Twitter broke its own verification system by making the blue check — previously a signal that the account had provided information about its owner’s identity — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23448317/elon-musk-twitter-blue-verification-live-ios">available for purchase</a>. Yesterday, which is approximately a month ago in Elon Musk time, a solution rolled out: gray checks that indicated that the account was official. By the end of the day, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23449122/twitter-official-verified-gray-checkmark-verification">those checks had been rolled back</a>.</p>

<p id="WPPoci">Brands such as Coca-Cola, Twitter, Wired, and Ars Technica have the new-old gray checks (but not <a href="https://twitter.com/verge">@Verge</a>, which is, we promise, our real one, unlike <a href="https://twitter.com/recklesspatel">this impostor account</a>). This...</p>
