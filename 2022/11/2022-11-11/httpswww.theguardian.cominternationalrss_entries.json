Ballots are still being counted three days after Tuesday\u2019s midterms, and it seems like Democrats may have a shot at taking control of the Senate again. While the Associated Press hasn\u2019t called the race, there are signs that senator <strong>Mark Kelly</strong> has won reelection in Arizona, though the fate of Nevada\u2019s <strong>Catherine Cortez Masto</strong> is still up in the air. If both triumph, <strong>Joe Biden</strong>\u2019s allies win control of the chamber for another two years. But if only one does, the run-off election for Georgia\u2019s Senate seat set for 6 December will determine control. And that\u2019s to say nothing of the House, where several key races are yet to be called.

Others weren\u2019t so kind. The Corrie actor Sue Cleaver reckoned he shouldn\u2019t be skiving off when parliament wasn\u2019t in recess. The singer Boy George said that if his mum had died of Covid he would have walked out of the camp. The former rugby player Mike Tindall observed that Matt just talked \u201cbullshit, bullshit, bullshit\u201d. The radio DJ Chris Moyles looked as if he wanted to throw up.

The man behind the podium, as he self-importantly put it. The guy who wanted to understand economics, so he went to work in the Bank of England, before going on to become an adviser to George Osborne.

Either that or he\u2019s never watched the show. I\u2019m a Celeb is one of the most sadistic shows on TV and the only reason Matt has been brought on is to be the hate figure against whom the country can unite.

The result was a spectacular global success that inspired an endless slew of similar deck-building games, all based around the same idea: you start with a small pack of digital cards, each with different powers, and you place them on the board against an opponent with a different deck. The most powerful wins.</p><p>Designed by Ben Brode, one of the co-creators of Hearthstone, Marvel Snap is a fresh take on the genre, in which players build collections of superheroes, each with different power ratings, and battle with a human or AI opponent to control three locations in the middle of the game board. The beauty is in the stripped-down simplicity of the interface: there are only six turns in each game, and only four cards can be placed at each location. As rounds progress, participants are able to place more powerful heroes. The player whose cards dominate the greatest number of play spaces at the end of the sixth round takes the match.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/nov/11/marvel-snap-review-superhero-showdown-card-game-is-utterly-compulsive\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/11/ship-carrying-23o-asylum-seekers-docks-in-france-after-italy-refuses-entry", "title": "Ship carrying 230 asylum seekers docks in France after Italy refuses entry", "date_published": "2022-11-11 10:03:46+00:00", "description": "<p>French interior minister warns authorities in Rome of \u2018severe consequences\u2019 for failing to accept vessel</p><p>A charity-operated ship carrying hundreds of asylum seekers who were rescued at sea in the central Mediterranean has docked in the French military port of Toulon after almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/09/rescued-people-italian-waters-row-between-italy-france\">three weeks stuck offshore</a>, during which Italy\u2019s far-right government failed to give it safe port.</p><p>The French government agreed on Thursday to take the boat in, calling it an \u201cexceptional\u201d move and promising to retaliate against Italy for not respecting international law to give port to the boat in Italian waters.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/11/ship-carrying-23o-asylum-seekers-docks-in-france-after-italy-refuses-entry\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/11/martin-scorsese-at-80-francis-ford-coppola-steve-mcqueen-woody-allen-greatest-director-alive", "title": "Martin Scorsese at 80: Francis Ford Coppola, Steve McQueen and Woody Allen on the \u2018greatest director alive\u2019", "date_published": "2022-11-11 10:00:09+00:00", "description": "<p>Ahead of his birthday next week, directors including Tim Burton, Edgar Wright, Lynne Ramsay and Luca Guadagnino reveal their favourite scenes \u2013 and what Scorsese\u2019s work means to them</p><p><em>Steve McQueen</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/11/martin-scorsese-at-80-francis-ford-coppola-steve-mcqueen-woody-allen-greatest-director-alive\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/11/experience-struck-by-lightning-while-sitting-on-sofa", "title": "Experience: I was struck by lightning while sitting on my sofa", "date_published": "2022-11-11 10:00:08+00:00", "description": "<p>I felt dazed.

From the very first page, the author\u2019s unmistakable voice ricochets between the reader\u2019s ears: giggling, provoking, digressing, seducing and dropping deadpan little hints about his own life.<br /><br />Oscar-winning screenwriter and director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/quentintarantino\" title=\"\">Quentin Tarantino</a> has published his first work of movie criticism, a study of his personal favourites from the New American Cinema era, including superb, boisterous pieces on Peter Yates\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/19/bullitt-yates-action\" title=\"\">Bullitt</a>, John G Avildsen\u2019s Joe<em>, </em>Don Siegel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/23/dirty-harry-clint-eastwood-70s-antihero\" title=\"\">Dirty Harry</a>, John Boorman\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/30/deliverance-1972-film-john-boorman-anniversary\" title=\"\">Deliverance</a>, Sam Peckinpah\u2019s The Getaway, Peter Bogdanovich\u2019s Daisy Miller, Martin Scorsese\u2019s Taxi Driver and Sylvester Stallone\u2019s Paradise Alley.

But as so often in the past, I fell under Tarantino\u2019s eerie spell. His passionate knowledge of movies and TV is amazing and slightly terrifying. This kind of engagement is on a level that few ever reach. Among Brit film-makers, only Edgar Wright can match Tarantino\u2019s superhuman encyclopedism.<br /><br />Despite the title, there\u2019s not much that\u2019s speculative about it. The keynote is cheerful, resounding certainty. Having said which, he does indulge in some expert what-if fantasising about how films could have been made another way, particularly Taxi Driver. He hates the Bernard Herrmann music, describing it as \u201cthe minimalist car noise \u2013 asshole with a sax \u2013 score Hermann pawned off on Scorsese\u201d. Tarantino also thinks it\u2019s important to understand that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/robertdeniro\" title=\"\">Robert De Niro</a>\u2019s character Travis Bickle was never actually in Vietnam at all because a real Vietnam veteran would not be so wary of and ignorant about Black people. He says it was cowardly to turn the Black pimp of Paul Schrader\u2019s original script into a white man (though conceding the brilliance of Harvey Keitel\u2019s performance) and wonders aloud how it might have played differently with other mooted directors: Richard Mulligan or Brian De Palma, or with the studio\u2019s first pick, Jeff Bridges, in the lead.</p><p><br />Yet Tarantino\u2019s insights, brazen and brilliant as they always are, are weirdly upstaged by the tiny, unfollowed-up hints he drops about his own psyche \u2013 which comprise the ostensible \u201cmemoir\u201d part of the book. Tarantino doesn\u2019t talk about his father Tony\u2019s absence from his life but says at the age of seven, he was taken by his mother and stepfather to see the highly adult film Joe in a double bill. The other film, for the record, was Carl Reiner\u2019s comedy Where\u2019s Poppa?
