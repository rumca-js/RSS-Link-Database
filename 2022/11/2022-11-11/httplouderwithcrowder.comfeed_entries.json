Chappelle reps told the paper there was nothing to suggest there was a boycott when they attended the writers' meeting. <em>New York Post</em> is also who reported that <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-snl-host-outrage\" target=\"_blank\">there were boycotts over Elon Musk</a> when he was a host, due to Musk having different opinions than everyone who works on SNL.\n</p><p>\n\tThe current comedy writers suck pretty hard at writing comedy.

Employees with a certain agenda were determining what we saw.</p><blockquote>Users appear to consider the new trending list as more authentic than the politics-infused list allegedly curated by Twitter, which is a fair assumption.
