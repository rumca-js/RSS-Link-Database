<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>For me, the Steam Deck&rsquo;s &ldquo;a-ha&rdquo; moment came when I figured out how to play the PC version of <em>Stranglehold</em> without a mouse and keyboard.</p>



<p>The John Woo-produced, somewhat underappreciated third-person shooter didn&rsquo;t include controller support when it launched on Windows in 2007 and neither did the re-release on GOG a few years ago. That and some other odd display issues kept me from ever giving it a try on my gaming PC.</p>



<p>But after sideloading the game through Steam Deck&rsquo;s desktop mode, Valve&rsquo;s button remapping tool saved the day. This Steam Deck feature is so extensive that you can get practically any game to work well with the portable console&rsquo;s thumbsticks, triggers and buttons, and I&rsquo;ve since used it to breathe new life into other old PC games as well.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s an in-depth guide to everything Steam Deck&rsquo;s button remapping can do:</p>



<h2 id="how-to-find-the-steam-decks-button-remapper">How to find the Steam Deck&rsquo;s button remapper</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Steam Deck Controller Settings" class="wp-image-1364392" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/steamdeckquicksettings.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Once you&rsquo;ve loaded a game on the Steam Deck, hit the Steam button, select &ldquo;Controller Settings,&rdquo; then press the A button again.</p>



<p>Scroll down from here and you&rsquo;ll find some quick settings such as Y-Axis inversion and sensitivity levels for the mouse and trackpad. Keep in mind that <strong>these are independent of the in-game control settings</strong>, so I would only make adjustments here if the game itself doesn&rsquo;t offer them.</p>



<p>Still, those quick settings only hint at what&rsquo;s possible. To truly take advantage of Steam Deck button mapping, you&rsquo;ll need to create your own layout. Pick a PC game from your library with poor or non-existent controller support, then read on for details.</p>



<h2 id="creating-a-steam-deck-controller-layout-the-basics">Creating a Steam Deck controller layout: The basics</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Selecting a controller template on the Steam Deck" class="wp-image-1364394" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/steamdecktemplates.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Before building your own Steam Deck controller layout, you should visit the game&rsquo;s control menu first. Using your phone, <strong>take pictures of the game&rsquo;s keyboard and mouse assignments</strong> so you can reference them along the way. Trust me, this will make the remapping process much less tedious.</p>



<p>For this tutorial, I&rsquo;m going to use <em>F.E.A.R.</em> as an example, as the first-person shooter format does a great job demonstrating everything you can do with button remapping. (That, and I&rsquo;ve been wanting to get the game off my backlog anyway.)</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s an overview of how remapping works:</p>



<ul><li>From the Controller Settings menu, select the current layout, then select the Templates menu.</li><li>Scroll down and select &ldquo;Keyboard (WASD) and Mouse.&rdquo; This maps the left stick to the WASD keys and emulates mouse movement with the right stick.</li><li>From the Controller Settings menu, select Edit Layout.</li><li>Use the left sidebar to choose between the physical controls on your Steam Deck.</li><li>Use the right-hand menu to assign commands to those controls.</li></ul><div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Remapping keyboard controls to the Steam Deck buttons" class="wp-image-1364393" height="1009" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/steamdeckremap.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>In the image above, I&rsquo;ve set the Steam Deck&rsquo;s face buttons to correspond with keyboard commands for some common actions in F.E.A.R., including Jump, Use, Flashlight, and Reload. (We&rsquo;ll get into the long-press behavior later.)</p>



<p>Once you&rsquo;ve mapped those face buttons, you can move on down the left sidebar to map the Steam Deck&rsquo;s thumbsticks, triggers, D-Pad, trackpads, and rear buttons. You can map those controls to pretty much anything, including mouse buttons, the scroll wheel, and even system actions like the screenshot function.</p>



<p>While most of this is pretty straightforward, pay special attention to the Joysticks tab, and in particular the <strong>&#9881;</strong> gear icon next to &ldquo;Right Joystick Behavior.&rdquo; From here you can adjust the sensitivity, scale, and dead zone for mouse emulation, which is especially useful when mapping first- and third-person shooters. You&rsquo;ll likely need to fine-tune the sensitive as you go, but you can do this later through the quick settings menu.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Controlling Joystick Mouse sensitivity on Steam Deck" class="wp-image-1364395" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/steamdeckjoystickmouse.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Once you&rsquo;ve configured everything to your liking, go back to the Controller Settings menu and the <strong>&#9881;</strong> gear underneath your layout. From here you can either choose &ldquo;Export&rdquo; to save the layout on your device or &ldquo;Share&rdquo; to upload it for other folks to use as well. (More on that shortly.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Steam Deck layout save menu" class="wp-image-1364396" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/steamdecklayoutsave.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p></p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Give your layout a name and a description, then save it. It&rsquo;ll appear in the &ldquo;Your Layouts&rdquo; tab on the layout selection screen, so you can always come back to it even if you mess around with alternative control schemes.</p>



<h2 id="advanced-steam-deck-mapping-options">Advanced Steam Deck mapping options</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Steam Deck radial menus" class="wp-image-1364397" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fearradial.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Yes, the Steam Deck lets you roll your own radial weapon selector.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>The fun doesn&rsquo;t stop there. Valve also offers a few advanced ways to optimize your PC games for the Steam Deck controller:</p>



<p><strong>Secondary commands:</strong>&nbsp;For games where a simple button press isn&rsquo;t enough, you can map additional key bindings behind a long-press or double-press. You can also map separate bindings for when you hold and release a button&mdash;perfect for shooters that toggle the ironsights with a trigger button when you&rsquo;d prefer to hold it down instead.</p>



<ul><li>Hit the <strong>&#9881;</strong> gear next to any button and select &ldquo;Add Extra Command.&rdquo;</li><li>Choose which button to map it to, then hit the <strong>&#9881;</strong> gear next to the new command and select &ldquo;Regular Press.&rdquo;</li><li>Choose to map the extra command to a long-press, double-press, hold, or release.</li></ul><div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Steam Deck secondary controls" class="wp-image-1364407" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/steamdecksecondary.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p><strong>Virtual menus:</strong> This extremely neat trick lets you create your own radial menus for the touchpad, directional pad, or thumbsticks, complete with visual overlays that appear in the game. It especially comes in handy for shooters or MMORPGs where you&rsquo;d normally switch between weapons through the number row.</p>



<ul><li>From the layout screen, head to Virtual Menus, then select &ldquo;Add Virtual Menu.&rdquo;</li><li>Give it a name that&rsquo;ll help you identify it later, such as &ldquo;F.E.A.R. Weapon Selector.&rdquo;</li><li>Choose the type of menu you want to create. Radial works best with the touchpad or thumbsticks, Touch Menu is just for the touchpad, and Hotbar is mainly for cycling through items with the D-Pad.</li></ul><div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Steam Deck Virtual Menus" class="wp-image-1364408" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/steamvirtualmenu.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<ul><li>Hit the pencil button next to the newly-created menu.</li><li>Hit &ldquo;Add Command,&rdquo; and choose the key you&rsquo;d like to assign.</li><li>Use &ldquo;Add Virtual Menu Entry&rdquo; to create additional items in the menu.</li><li>Use the dotted circle next to each button to select an icon for each item. <strong>These icons will appear in the overlay during the game</strong>.</li></ul><div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Steam Deck radial control menu" class="wp-image-1364409" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/steamdeckradialcontrol.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<ul><li>Optionally use the <strong>&#9881;</strong> gear next to each button and select &ldquo;Rename Command&rdquo; to give it a name that will appear on screen as well.</li><li>Finally, return to the main remapping menu and assign a Steam Deck control method to the Virtual Menu. For instance, you can head to Trackpads, tap the drop-down next to &ldquo;Left Trackpad Behavior,&rdquo; and choose your newly-created menu from the list.</li></ul><p><strong>Action sets:</strong> This lets you switch to a different control scheme in response to a button press. A great example is reducing the joystick-to-mouse sensitivity when looking down the sights in a first-person shooter. Here&rsquo;s how to set that up:</p>



<ul><li>In the remap menu, head to Action Sets.</li><li>Select the <strong>&#9881;</strong> gear next to &ldquo;Default&rdquo; and select &ldquo;Add Layer.&rdquo;</li><li>Give the layer a name, such as &ldquo;While Aiming.&rdquo;</li></ul><div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Steam Deck Action Set creation" class="wp-image-1364411" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/steamdeckactionsets.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<ul><li>In the Trigger menu, hit the <strong>&#9881;</strong> gear next to &ldquo;Soft Pull&rdquo; and select &ldquo;Add sub command.&rdquo;</li><li>Hit &ldquo;Add command&rdquo; to bring up the control selection screen.</li><li>Navigate to the &ldquo;Action Sets&rdquo; tab and select &ldquo;Add Action Set Layer.&rdquo;</li></ul><div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Adding Action Sets on Steam Deck" class="wp-image-1364412" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/steamdeckchooseactionset.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p></p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<ul><li>Select the &ldquo;While Aiming&rdquo; Action Set, disable the two blue toggles, and hit &ldquo;Confirm.&rdquo;</li><li>Return to the remap menu and hit R1 so that &ldquo;While Aiming&rdquo; appears in the top-left of the screen.</li><li>In the Trigger menu, hit &ldquo;Add Command&rdquo; next to &ldquo;Soft Pull.&rdquo;</li></ul><div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Steam Deck Action Set behavior" class="wp-image-1364413" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/steamdeckactionoptions.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<ul><li>Navigate to the &ldquo;Action Sets&rdquo; tab and select &ldquo;Remove Action Set Layer.&rdquo;</li><li>Select the &ldquo;While Aiming&rdquo; Action Set and hit &ldquo;Confirm.&rdquo;</li><li>In the Joysticks menu, hit the <strong>&#9881;</strong> gear next to &ldquo;Right Joystick Behavior,&rdquo; then lower the mouse sensitivity.</li></ul><h2 id="community-layouts-a-shortcut-with-caveats">Community layouts: A shortcut (with caveats)</h2>



<p>If all that just sounds like too much work for the sake of play, there is a shortcut: Just select one of the Community Layouts that other players have created. You&rsquo;ll find this by clicking on your layout in the Controller Settings page, then heading to the &ldquo;Community Layouts&rdquo; tab.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Steam Deck Community Layouts" class="wp-image-1364414" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/steamdeckactioncommunity.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>The problem with community layouts is that you never know what you&rsquo;re going to get, and I&rsquo;ve seen some truly horrendous layouts even for games with straightforward control schemes. Community layouts can be a good starting point, but it&rsquo;s still worth understanding the button remapper so you can make your own adjustments or start from scratch if need be.</p>



<p>While this is admittedly a lot to take in, a little experimentation is all it takes to get hooked. When everything clicks, you&rsquo;ll realize you can create the perfect layout for pretty much any game on the Steam Deck, no matter how complex the control scheme.</p>



<p>Now, excuse me while I figure out how to set up <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_X-Wing_(video_game)&amp;xcust=2-1-1364387-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">X-Wing</a></em>.</p>

<p>No, we didn&rsquo;t make this choice simply because the drive is named &ldquo;Game Drive SSD.&rdquo; This WD drive hits the performance criteria you want and it features lust-worthy USB 3.2 SuperSpeed 20Gbps support. Although USB 3.2 SuperSpeed 20Gbps has been rare, many newer motherboards support it today. If your PC doesn&rsquo;t support it, the good news is that it will support the far more common USB 3.2 SuperSpeed 10Gbps, the next-best thing. That still gives you good performance now, and future-proofs you for your next mobo upgrade. Unlike a typical portable SSD that may have a plastic or rubber shell to absorb hits, the WD Black P50 is metal, which should help wick and radiate the heat from the smokin&rsquo; SSD inside. If ultimate performance is what you&rsquo;re after, WD&rsquo;s P50 Game Drive is worth every penny of its premium price.</p>

<p>Seagate&rsquo;s FireCuda Gaming SSD is a worthy alternative, but it has a much steeper price tag for similar performance to the WD Black P50. However, the FireCuda has an absolutely stunning external SSD and is worthy of a place on any desktop. It&rsquo;s not just a pretty fa&ccedil;ade though&mdash;it&rsquo;s compatible with a SuperSpeed USB 20Gbps port, meaning it can attain transfer rates of up to 2GBps. It is certainly the coolest-looking external SSD on this list, and if it weren&rsquo;t for the premium price, it would probably be our top pick.</p>

<p>The Crucial X6 Portable SSD is a uniquely square-shaped SSD that can easily be placed in your hip pocket. In a sea of portable SSDs whose shape makes them a literal pain when pocketed, the thin, rounded-edge X6 is a sigh of relief. It&rsquo;s not only small and easy to carry around, but it also packs some decent performance, and you won&rsquo;t find many cheaper.  While it&rsquo;s not state-of-the-art fast, it&rsquo;s fast enough for most users and the affordable price makes it a great value SSD.</p>

<p>The Crucial X6 might be small, but it still can&rsquo;t match the Adata&rsquo;s Elite SE880 for portability. Measuring in at only 2.55 inches long, 1.38 inches wide, and 0.48 inches thick, it resembles a USB thumb drive more than a standard external SSD. It also weighs a featherlight 1.1 ounces&mdash;making it easy to forget it&rsquo;s even in your pocket. </p>

<p>In terms of performance, the Elite SE880 is quick to handle everyday tasks but slows down during long writes. In a real-world 48GB transfer test, the drive came through with flying colors, but it lost a lot of ground in the longer contiguous write tests. This means that photo and video pros with large files to transfer might want to consider other options.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-test-external-ssd-game-performance">How we test external SSD game performance</h2>



<p>The biggest question you want to know is, how much does using an external drive hurt game performance. To give us an idea of how much it matters, we used UL&rsquo;s new 3DMark Storage Benchmark. To create the benchmark, UL essentially records the drive access patterns during several common gaming tasks to make &ldquo;traces.&rdquo; These drive-access traces are then run on the tested storage device multiple times to duplicate the patterns without having to actually load the game. </p>



<p>For its test, 3DMark reproduces what happens loading to the start menus of <em>Battlefield V</em>, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4</em>, and <em>Overwatch</em>. 3DMark Storage also tests using OBS, or Open Broadcast System, to record <em>Overwatch</em> being played at 1080p resolution at 60fps, installing <em>The Outer Worlds</em> from the Epic launcher, and saving a game in <em>The Outer Worlds</em>. For the final test, 3DMark Storage tests copying the Steam folder for <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> from an external SSD to the target drive.</p>



<p>We used a 12th-gen Intel Core i9-12900K running Windows 11 on an Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Hero motherboard. The board features native Thunderbolt 4 and USB 3.2 10Gbps ports. We added a Silverstone ECU06 for USB 3.2 SuperSpeed 20Gbps support.  We then used a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/NVMe-Gen2x2-Type-Enclosure-NST-220C3-SG/dp/B08ZK1DTDN&amp;xcust=2-1-553786-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Vantec M.2 NVMe SSD to USB 3.2 Gen2x2 20G Type C </a>enclosure with a Western Digital SN700 NVMe SSD to test USB 3.2 20Gbps and 10Gbps performance. We also installed the same SN700 into a PCIe 3.0 riser card to test its native performance. This gives you an idea of how much you lose going from being installed inside the laptop or PC compared to using a USB port. For added contrast, we also ran 3DMark Storage on an older Plextor PX-512M7VG SATA SSD inside of a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075ZNCVJ5&amp;xcust=2-1-553786-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Silverstone MS09 SATA </a>enclosure that was plugged into a USB 3.2 10Gbps port. And because you want to know how slow a hard drive would be, we also ran the same test on a Western Digital 14TB EasyStore hard drive plugged into a USB 3.2 10Gbps port. The EasyStore is actually limited to USB 3.2 SuperSpeed 5Gbps.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Image of results of 3DMark Storage test running on various USB, SATA and PCIe interfaces" class="wp-image-553956" height="689" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3DMark_Storage_Bandwidth_Interface_Comparison.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Longer bars indicate better performance. Right mouse click and select &ldquo;open in new tab&rdquo; to view larger image.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>What should you make of the above results? Well, clearly if you can install an SSD inside of your PC, you&rsquo;ll get the most performance out of it. But you should consider some of the context. If you&rsquo;re only looking at the big long red bar at the top of the chart, consider that the particular test is measuring what would happen if you copied a large folder of files to the SSD. For most people, that&rsquo;s only done once in a while.</p>



<p>The more common scenario is waiting for a game to launch. Running an internal NVMe drive will still be faster, but the gap closes a little. Between the three popular USB interfaces: USB 20Gbps, USB 10Gbps, and SATA on USB 10Gbps, the fastest is USB 3.2 20Gbps. With a USB 3.2 20Gbps SSD, you might see <em>Battlefield V</em> shave 25 percent of the load time versus a USB 3.2 10Gbps drive. Of course, performance is also game dependent. For instance, both <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Battlefield</em> see 45 percent or so greater bandwidth on the internal SSD, but with the less graphically intense <em>Overwatch</em>, it&rsquo;s closer to 30 percent.</p>



<p>The other surprise is the performance of the SATA SSD versus the NVMe SSD when the NVMe SSD is in a USB 3.2 10Gbps port. In game loads, saves, and install scenarios, they&rsquo;re fairly close. The NVMe external SSD does open up to huge lead over the slower SATA once you move to a task where you&rsquo;re copying a huge amount of files&mdash;such as the <em>CS:GO</em> results. But again, how often do you do that?</p>



<p>Of course we can&rsquo;t leave this without pointing out just horrible hard drives are. Would it be more improved with a faster hard drive? Unlikely. The very minimum you should use if storing games on an external drive is a SATA SSD, so don&rsquo;t run a game from your external hard drive unless you like to wait for everything.</p>
