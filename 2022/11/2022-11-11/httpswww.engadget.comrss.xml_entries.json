Senator Ed Markey has <a href=\"https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-demands-answers-from-twitter-on-disinformation-and-fake-accounts\">sent a letter</a> to company chief Elon Musk demanding answers regarding imposters on the platform. Markey wants to know how Twitter not only let a reporter for <em>The Washington Post</em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/11/twitter-blue-checkmark/\">create</a> a verified account impersonating the senator (now trivial with an $8 Blue subscription), but told users in a pop-up that the verification was due to a role in government. This was despite an existing checkmark for the real account, Markey said.</p><p>Markey also wants Twitter to detail its verification process, including a comparison with the previous method. He asked Musk if Twitter will reinstitute merit-based verifications and, if so, how it will prevent fake accounts from receiving blue ticks. The senator gave Musk until November 25th to respond.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The political leader was direct in his criticism. He accused Musk of instituting a \"haphazard\" series of changes at Twitter that included dismantling protections against disinformation. The service is quickly becoming the \"Wild West of social media\" and has a duty to prevent deception and manipulation from taking root, Markey added.</p><p>Musk hasn't commented on the letter, and Twitter has effectively <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/11/10/twitter-ditches-communications\">shut down</a> its communications team. The entrepreneur previously argued that paying for verification democratizes the feature, and in a recent tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1591121142961799168\">claimed</a> Twitter was backing citizen journalism despite opposition from the \"media elite.\"</p><p>There's no certainty the letter will translate to government action, particularly when the recent midterm elections could shift the congressional balance of power in January. Twitter's decision to temporarily halt Blue subscriptions in response to impersonations, not to mention the company's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-starts-doling-out-official-checkmarks-again-045618923.html\">off-again-on-again \"official\" checkmarks</a>, may also address some of Markey's concerns.

The subscription gets you things like auto uploads and unlimited backups on the cloud, plus discounts on products at the GoPro website and camera replacement. We found a lot to love about the Hero11 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gopro-hero-11-review-125905853.html\">in our review</a>, including admiration for the new taller sensor. It not only allows for a better horizon lock, but lets you record in \"full frame,\" a mode that captures all possible action then allows you to crop it for different venues after the fact. For example, cropping to 16:9 for YouTube and 9:16 for TikTok.

When you enter <strong>THERMOENG</strong> at checkout, it brings the price down to $179, which isn't the lowest it's ever been, but beats many of the discounts we've <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/googles-nest-learning-thermostat-is-on-sale-for-199-right-now-143020941.html\">seen recently</a>. As a smart device, the Nest Learning Thermostat links up to your phone via the app, allowing you to control the thermostat from anywhere. In time, the Nest gradually learns your temperature preferences, allowing it to then automate your home's heading and cooling schedule with minimal input on your end. There are eco settings indicated by a green leaf, that let you know when you're optimizing your energy usage. It can even detect when no one's home and set the temps accordingly, so you're not overly heating or cooling an empty house.&nbsp;</p><p>If $179 still feels a bit steep, Google also makes a lower-end model called the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOEhSUERZVFA_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tNGYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImIzYTUyZjRiLTE1ZGYtNDFiNi1hZjhlLWNiYzg2NmE1MTI5NCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdwaiFE94cMzjNoaWmr5MwMXkWzHcS6NCmdTQwm04CJK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08HRPDYTP\">Nest Thermostat</a>.

The Series  X offers a solid 1TB of SSD space and 4K gaming. The Series S tops out at 512GB of storage and has a native resolution of 1440p. Also note that the Series S is digital only, as in you can't insert any physical game discs. That said, the Xbox Series X goes for over $500, granted you can find it.

The battery is a tougher sell at full price, but today it's <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDk5QldZN1dUP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTRlLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2ZTQxZTc1Zi03NjI5LTRmMTctOWU0NS01YjlhODlhYTliMWMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZgVwFF1Gd3I55rI8kpnlix8AmHznYtPjiyjIvZrvgBQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB099BWY7WT\">available for $71</a>, which marks the lowest price we've seen to date. For reference, Apple typically sells the device for $99, though its average price online has sat closer to $90 in recent months.</p><p></p><p>The MagSafe Battery Pack works with any iPhone 12, 13, or 14 model, and using it is as simple as slapping it on the back of one of those devices and letting it do its thing. You don't have to press any additional buttons to start the charge, unlike many third-party competitors. Design wise, it's a slim, matte plastic rectangle that's designed to match the dimensions of an iPhone 12 or 13 mini, so it'll fit entirely within the back of a larger device like the iPhone 14 Pro Max.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Because this is an Apple-made product, it's also able to integrate with an iPhone in ways competing MagSafe batteries can not. You <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212174\">can see</a> the pack's charge level through iOS's Control Center and Batteries widget, for instance, and you can reverse-charge the battery itself from your iPhone when the latter is plugged in. By default, the pack will only charge your phone to around 90 percent to better preserve its efficiency, though you can turn that off if you wish.</p><p>If you have a 20W or higher charger and a USB-C to Lightning cable, you can also turn the MagSafe Battery Pack into a 15W wireless charging puck, which gives it a bit of utility when you aren't out of the house. Unfortunately, and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-appeal-brazil-ban-iphone-sales-no-charger-052020204.html\">perhaps expectedly</a>, Apple doesn't include a cable or power brick in the box, but that's less of a problem if you already own both of those for your iPhone. (If you don't, our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html\">guide to the best fast chargers</a> may be of interest.)&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to actually charging your iPhone, the MagSafe Battery Pack is a bit more compromised. Part of that is just due to the nature of wireless charging; the tech has improved over the years, but if you want the fastest charge possible, a cable with a traditional battery pack will usually be quicker to top things off. But the capacity of the MagSafe Battery Pack itself is fairly small at 1,460mAh (or 11.13Wh), so it can only charge a standard iPhone 14 to about 60-65 percent from zero.&nbsp;</p><p>We've recommended <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOTlaNDc4SzkvcmVmPW94X3NjX2FjdF90aXRsZV8xP3NtaWQ9QTI5NFA0WDlFV1ZYTEomcHNjPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tNGUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjZlNDFlNzVmLTc2MjktNGYxNy05ZTQ1LTViOWE4OWFhOWIxYyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAauym6ah54PPMAZWcXZyVuCSKGRnbF51_xR7-hys4wKJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB099Z478K9%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Fsmid%3DA294P4X9EWVXLJ%26psc%3D1\">Anker's 622 Magnetic Battery</a> as a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/anker-622-magsafe-battery-pack-irl-143059141.html\">good alternative</a> to the MagSafe Battery Pack in the past; that one has a larger 5,000mAh (19.25Wh) capacity that can get closer to a 80-85 charge on the same phone. It also costs less than Apple's pack even with the latter on sale, has a built-in kickstand, and comes in a wider variety of colors. (The MagSafe Battery Pack is only available in white.) It's not designed as neatly for iPhones and lacks the extras noted above, but it's a better value if you just want more power from a compact MagSafe pack.

For that, the MagSafe Battery Pack is fine, particularly since Apple released a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/20/magsafe-battery-pack-faster-charging/\">firmware update</a> earlier this year that boosted the pack's charging rate from 5W to 7.5W, which is still slower than using a cable but matches the Anker models above. If you can live with the lesser capacity and know you'll value some of its more iPhone-friendly features, it should be easier to justify at this deal price.</p><p><em>Get the latest </em><a href=\"https://engadget.com/black-friday/\"><em>Black Friday</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cyber-monday/\"><em>Cyber Monday</em></a><em> offers by following </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribing to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em>.</em></p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/rings-video-doorbell-drops-to-60-ahead-of-black-friday-170912549.html?src=rss", "title": "Ring's Video Doorbell drops to $60 ahead of Black Friday", "date_published": "2022-11-11 17:09:12+00:00", "description": "<p>If you've been waiting for the holiday shopping season to grow your smart home ecosystem without dropping unnecessary amounts of money, you're in luck.

In a <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/News/68671/does-the-surface-pro-9-mark-a-turning-point-for-repairability-at-microsoft\">statement</a> to iFixit, Microsoft says it plans \"broad availability\" of parts for individuals and independent repair shops in the first half of 2023.

A wider repair network will be available in early 2023 with the help of a \"major US retailer.\"</p><p>That improved stance is reflected in the company's latest designs. Microsoft says repairability was a \"major focus\" in the Surface Pro 9's construction, and iFixit has confirmed as much in its independently run teardown of the Windows tablet. The user-accessible SSD is just the start. The battery is screwed in rather than glued, and the display is easier to remove when you're digging into the internals. This is the \"most repairable\" Surface yet, according to iFixit, and a sharp contrast with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2014-06-23-surface-pro-3-teardown.html\">notoriously difficult-to-fix</a> builds of the past.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"217e53076da34002a3c42c4e9e31b9d0\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>This isn't the first time Microsoft has made nods toward do-it-yourself repair.

The RAM is still soldered on, too, even if it might offer added performance and energy savings as a result.

The thing is, I loathe black mirrors; the blank void that stares out when a TV is off creeps me out. (I blame <em>The Ring.</em>) I decided all screens had to stay hidden if I wasn\u2019t actively watching them and just avoided a wall-mounted TV altogether \u2013 until the market came up with one that looks like art when it's off.</p><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlUUTVDQzRQP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTMxLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5OWYwYjJhZC1kMGZiLTQyZmUtYjgxYy1lOGQzMzY4MzM0ZjEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXkRsS-gNxhVX4ydWUI2mTg6YoJmxVgb280ZQOV1GFfw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09TQ5CC4P\">Samsung\u2019s The Frame</a> came out in 2017. I bought a 43-inch model back in 2019 and have been a big fan ever since. On the inside, it\u2019s a thoroughly serviceable smart TV with a QLED panel and Samsung\u2019s Tizen OS (which the company<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-partnerships-tizen-tv-platform-123730369.html\"> just licensed for use</a> with non-Samsung TVs). The picture is bright, the sound is clear, and Tizen is easy to figure out \u2013 but I forked over $800 for the namesake feature.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Frame does a great job of looking like art hanging on my wall. The thin panel has picture-frame edges and mounts flat against the wall, like a giant photo. The panel connects via a thin wire to an external receiver/port hub/tuner box combo, which means you can actually drop the wire behind the drywall and have it pop out elsewhere, furthering the illusion that there\u2019s nothing electronic going on here. The brick walls of my old house aren\u2019t letting that happen, so I hide the wire behind a plant.</p><figure><img alt=\"Samsung The Frame\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/89f159b0-5a2c-11ed-a9bd-6158297b2227\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim</div></figure><p>As for the effect, I\u2019ve had people come over who asked me whether we had a TV at all, standing just a couple feet from The Frame. It\u2019s fun to turn it on and witness their total surprise. I will say I\u2019m jealous of the<a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvdGVsZXZpc2lvbnMtaG9tZS10aGVhdGVyL3R2cy90aGUtZnJhbWUvNTUtY2xhc3MtdGhlLWZyYW1lLXFsZWQtNGstc21hcnQtdHYtMjAyMi1xbjU1bHMwM2JhZnh6YS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk5ZjBiMmFkLWQwZmItNDJmZS1iODFjLWU4ZDMzNjgzMzRmMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWs56oDKv3aXpxbIrPpcxzNwzXwRgZTIzPiAAaFi8kYW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Ftelevisions-home-theater%2Ftvs%2Fthe-frame%2F55-class-the-frame-qled-4k-smart-tv-2022-qn55ls03bafxza%2F\"> latest models</a>, which have an anti-reflective matte finish that I wish my older model had. I think it enhances the effect.</p><p>The Frame\u2019s elegant hardware is a perk, but the other important factor in the art-not-TV illusion comes from Samsung\u2019s Art Store, an $8 monthly subscription that grants access to a ton of art to display. There are collections from the Louvre (though picking a Vermeer to hang on your wall might stretch credulity) as well as the Museum of Fine Arts Budapest, Etsy, Life Picture Collection, Saatchi Art, van Gogh Museum Amsterdam, BBC Earth, Magnum photos and lots more. I tend to go with abstracts and modern photography, and my kid likes the illustrations and wildlife photos.</p><p>But if you (understandably) have subscription fatigue from the 25 different services you pay for and don\u2019t want to add another to the list, the included \u201cSamsung collection\u201d offers 10 artworks for free. You can also use your own images if you prefer (just make sure they\u2019re<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-x-h2s-mirrorless-camera-review-123049866.html\"> large format</a> or they\u2019ll look pixelated). Personally, I\u2019ve never tried using my own images; I leave art to the professionals.</p><p></p><figure><img alt=\"Samsung The Frame\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/c31de2d0-5a2c-11ed-a7ff-fa11b765b24d\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim</div></figure><p>I like to swap out the image a couple times a month, and can easily kill an hour picking the next piece of art to grace my walls. There\u2019s an option that\u2019ll rotate through all images in a collection, automatically switching at regular intervals, from every 10 minutes to once a week. I firmly believe adding a mat to the image makes it look more real. After you pick the image you want to display, you have the option of selecting no mat, a modern mat or a shadowbox mat. Both mats come in ten different colors, but I\u2019ve never found anything that beats the antique white color in the modern mat option.</p><p>Considering the Frame is technically always-on, you may have reservations about the TV\u2019s energy usage. In art mode, Samsung says a 65-inch Frame consumes about 50 watts of power. I\u2019ve personally made a series of changes in life \u2013 downsizing square footage, trading a car for an e-bike, cutting out meat, etc. \u2013 to ease my carbon footprint, and I allow myself this minor indulgence. But if that aspect weighs on you, you could even consider the same<a href=\"https://www.green-e.org/certified-resources/carbon-offsets\"> carbon offsets</a> people buy when they fly.</p><p>Plus, there are a couple of features that make sure the Frame isn\u2019t <em>always</em> on. With Night Mode, the TV shuts itself off when the lights go out. Then in the morning, after sensing light again, it turns the art back on. You can also set it to detect when there\u2019s motion in the room, turning off when no one\u2019s around. When I tried this, my model kept turning off and never sensing motion again, despite me doing jumping jacks right in front of it, so I opted to disable that feature. The same sensors that detect darkness and (theoretically) movement also adjust the brightness of the image, so it never looks too intense, a trait that keeps things looking more like a framed oil painting and less like a TV. Which, for me, is the whole point.</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-air-fryers-133047180.html?src=rss", "title": "The best air fryers for 2022", "date_published": "2022-11-11 15:10:21+00:00", "description": "<p>Are you tempted by an air fryer, but fear you might just get another ill-fated kitchen gadget that takes up space in your tiny kitchen?

Not really. Air fryers are more like smaller convection ovens, ones that are often pod-shaped. This kitchen appliance works by combining a heating element and fan, which means the hot air can usually better crisp the outside of food than other methods. They often reach higher top temperatures than toaster ovens \u2013 which is part of the appeal.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>For most recipes, from chicken tenders to onion rings and sweet potato fries, a thin layer of oil (usually sprayed) helps to replicate that fried look and feel better. However, it will rarely taste precisely like the deep-fried version. Don\u2019t let that put you off, though, because the air fryer, in its many forms, combines some of the best parts of other cooking processes and brings them together into an energy-efficient way of cooking dinner. Or breakfast. Or lunch.</p><h3>Convection ovens</h3><p>You can separate most air fryers into two types and each has different pros and cons. Convection ovens are usually ovens with air fryer settings and features. They might have higher temperature settings to ensure that food crisps and cooks more like actually fried food. Most convection ovens are larger than dedicated air fryers, defeating some of the purpose of those looking to shrink cooking appliance surface area. Still, they are often more versatile and most have finer controls for temperatures, timings and even fan speed.</p><p>You may never need a built-in oven if you have a decent convection oven.  They often have the volume to handle roasts, entire chickens or tray bakes, and simply cook more, capacity-wise, making them more versatile than the pod-shaped competition.</p><p>The flip side of that is that you\u2019ll need the counter space to house them. It also means you can use traditional oven accessories, like baking trays or cake tins, that you might already own.</p><h3>Pod-shaped air fryers</h3><p>Pod-shaped air fryers<strong>&nbsp;</strong>are what you imagine when you think \u201cair fryer.\u201d They look like a cool, space-age kitchen gadget,  bigger than a kettle but smaller than a toaster oven. Many use a drawer to hold ingredients while cooking, usually a mesh sheet or a more solid, non-stick tray with holes to allow the hot air to circulate. With a few exceptions, most require you to open the drawer while things cook and flip or shake half-cooked items to ensure the even distribution of heat to everything.</p><p>That\u2019s one of a few caveats. Most pod-shaped air fryers \u2013 there are a few exceptions \u2013 don\u2019t have a window to see how things are cooking, so you\u2019ll need to closely scrutinize things as they cook, opening the device to check progress. These machines also generally use less energy \u2013 there\u2019s less space to heat \u2013 and many have parts that can be put directly into a dishwasher.</p><p>Some of the larger pod-shaped air fryers offer two separate compartments, which is especially useful for anyone planning to cook an entire meal with the appliance. You could cook a couple of chicken wings while simultaneously rustling up enough frozen fries for everyone. Naturally, those options take up more space, and they\u2019re usually heavy enough to stop you from storing them in cupboards or shelves elsewhere.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, you might have to buy extra things to make these pod fryers work the way you want them to. Some of the bigger manufacturers, like Philips and Ninja, offer convenient additions, but you\u2019ll have to pay for them.</p><figure><img alt=\"woman serving fried chicken with air fryer waffles\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-03/fcbb58a0-a9d4-11ec-97f7-1be0d263a8a8\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Fabi\u00e1n Ponce via Getty Images</div></figure><h2>Air fryer pros and cons</h2><p>Beyond the strengths and weaknesses of individual models, air fryers are pretty easy to use from the outset. Most models come with a convenient cooking time booklet covering most of the major foods you\u2019ll be air frying.</p><p>One of the early selling points is the ability to cook fries, wings and other delights with less fat than other methods. As air fryers need to circulate heated air, the trays and cooking plates have holes that can also let oil and fat drain out of meats, meaning less fat when you finally plate things up. For most cooking situations, you will likely need to lightly spray food with a vegetable oil. If you don\u2019t, there\u2019s the chance that things will burn or char. The oil will keep things moist on the surface, and we advise refreshing things with a bit of oil spray when you turn items during cooking.</p><p>Most air fryers are easy to clean \u2013 especially in comparison to a shallow or deep fryer. We\u2019ll get into cleaning guidance a little later.</p><p>With a smaller space to heat, air fryers are generally more energy-efficient than using larger appliances like ovens. And if you don\u2019t have an oven, air fryers are much more affordable \u2013 especially the pod options.</p><p>There are, however, some drawbacks. While air fryers are easy enough to use, they take time to master. You will adjust cooking times for even the simplest things \u2013 like frozen fries or brussels sprouts. If you\u2019re the kind of person that loves to find inspiration from the internet, in our experience, you can pretty much throw their timings out of the window. There are a lot of air fryer options, and factors like how fast they heat and how well distributed that heat is can \u2013 and will \u2013 affect cooking.</p><p>There\u2019s also a space limitation to air fryers. This is not a TARDIS \u2013 there\u2019s simply less space than most traditional ovens and many deep fat fryers. If you have a bigger family, you\u2019ll probably want to go for a bigger model of air fryer \u2013 possibly one that has multiple cooking areas.</p><p>You may also struggle to cook many items through as the heat settings will cook the surface of dishes long before it\u2019s cooked right through. If you\u2019re planning to cook an entire bird or a roast, please get a meat thermometer!</p><h2>The best accessories for your air fryer</h2><p>Beyond official accessories from the manufacturer, try to pick up silicone-tipped tools. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3KST3vj\">Tongs</a> are ideal, as is a silicon spatula to gently loosen food that might get stuck on the sides of the air fryer. These <a href=\"https://amzn.to/38PZemt\">silicone mats</a> will also help stop things from sticking to the wire racks on some air fryers.

Yes, you could use power cleaners from the grocery store, they could damage the surface of your air fryer. Likewise, metal scourers or brushes could strip away non-stick protection. Remember to unplug the device and let it cool completely.</p><p>Remove the trays, baskets and everything else from inside. If the manufacturer says the parts are dishwasher safe \u2013 and you have a dishwasher \u2013 the job is pretty much done.</p><p>Otherwise, wash each part in a mixture of warm water, with a splash of Dawn or another strong dish soap. Use a soft-bristled brush to pull away any greasy deposits or bits of food stuck to any surfaces. Remember to rinse everything. Otherwise, your next batch of wings could have a mild Dawn aftertaste. Trust us.</p><p>Take a microfiber cloth and tackle the outer parts and handles that might also get a little messy after repeated uses. This is especially useful for oven-style air fryers \u2013 use the cloth to wipe down the inner sides.</p><p>If Dawn isn\u2019t shifting oily stains, try mixing a small amount of baking soda with enough water to make a paste, and apply that so that it doesn\u2019t seep into any electrical parts or the heating element. Leave it to work for a few seconds before using a damp cloth to pull any greasy spots away. Rinse out the cloth and wipe everything down again, and you should be ready for the next time you need to air fry.</p><h2>How to find air fryer recipes</h2><p>Beyond fries, nuggets and \u2013 a revelation \u2013 frozen gyoza, there are a few ways to find recipes for your new air fryer. First, we found that the air fryer instruction manuals often have cooking guides and recipe suggestions for you to test out in your new kitchen gadget. The good thing with these is that they were made for your air fryer model, meaning success should be all but guaranteed. They are often a little unimaginative, however.</p><p>Many of the top recipe sites and portals have no shortage of air fryer recipes, and there\u2019s no harm in googling your favorite cuisine and adding the words \u201cair fryer\u201d on the end of the search string.  We\u2019ve picked up some reliable options from <em>Delish</em>, which also has a handy air fryer time <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/cookware-reviews/a35686392/air-fryer-conversion/\">converter</a> for changing oven and traditional fryer recipes.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/collection/air-fryer-recipes\"><em>BBC Good Food</em></a> is also worth browsing for some simple ideas, as is <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/\">NYT Cooking</a>, with the ability to directly search for air fryer suggestions.</p><p>And if you have a killer recipe or unique use for your air fryer, let us know in the comments. What\u2019s the air fryer equivalent of the Instant Pot cheesecake?

We\u2019re especially impressed by the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Wb3J0ZXhUTS1Gcnllci1DbGVhckNvb2stT2RvckVyYXNlLVN0YWlubGVzcy9kcC9CMDk2TjI4U1pQP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTRhLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4ZGZiMGUzNS0wZDU5LTQxYWMtYTZjZC1iOWFmNWE0YmRhZDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAV7QjhbAOnFWnCU6wdAgLMuYEzwivUl-pxjmwrjzveV0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FVortexTM-Fryer-ClearCook-OdorErase-Stainless%2Fdp%2FB096N28SZP%3F\">Instant Vortex Plus</a> with ClearCook and OdorErase, which features a clear viewing window so you can see your food while it\u2019s cooking, plus an odor-removing filter. In our testing, we found that it didn\u2019t completely eliminate smells, but it seemed significantly less smoky when compared to our Breville Smart Oven Air. We love the intuitive controls, the easy-to-clean nonstick drawer basket, plus the roomy interior \u2013 it\u2019s big enough to fit four chicken thighs. Plus, it heats up very quickly with virtually no preheating time.</p><p>A slightly more affordable option is its predecessor, the Instant Vortex Plus 6-Quart. It lacks the viewing window and the odor-removing filters, but it still has the same intuitive controls and roomy nonstick interior. If you want an even bigger option, Instant also offers Instant Vortex Plus in a 10-quart model that has a viewing window and a rotisserie feature.</p><h2>Best budget: Cosori Compact Air Fryer</h2><p></p><p>If you don\u2019t have a lot of space or money to spare, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DT1NPUkktaW5jbHVkZWQtRWxlY3RyaWMtUmVtaW5kZXItTm9uc3RpY2svZHAvQjA3R0pKNzFYUz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby00YS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGRmYjBlMzUtMGQ1OS00MWFjLWE2Y2QtYjlhZjVhNGJkYWQ4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAbIvBRDyBmoNXZ5CmaT2k33vr5_M5bbWhXoEgssCuf0R&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCOSORI-included-Electric-Reminder-Nonstick%2Fdp%2FB07GJJ71XS%3F\">Cosori\u2019s Compact Air Fryer</a> is a great option. As a 3.7-quart capacity machine, it doesn\u2019t take up too much counter space and it can easily fit into a cabinet when you\u2019re not using it. It has a traditional, square-ish pod design with a touch panel on the top half and a removable cooking basket on the bottom. I was impressed by how easy this air fryer was to use from start to finish. Learning how to program cooking modes and times was easy and using the basket is simple as well. It also has a handy release button that disconnects the air fryer basket from the base, which makes cleanup quick and simple. (Plus, the basket is dishwasher safe as well.)</p><p>This is a true air fryer in the sense that it has presets rather than a bunch of different cooking modes. It does have toast and bake, which are different from air fry, but otherwise you can choose from different food-specific presets like french fries, shrimp, frozen foods and more. While that\u2019s not so great if you want a multipurpose device, it\u2019s ideal if you\u2019re just looking for an air fryer that can do exactly that very well. Not only was the Cosori machine fairly quiet, but it also only took between three and five minutes to preheat in most cases, and everything I cooked in it \u2013 from tofu nuggets to chicken wings \u2013 came out crispy and flavorful.</p><h2>Best dual-zone: Ninja Foodi Dual Zone Air Fryer</h2><p></p><p>Most air fryers can make one thing at a time, but <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9OaW5qYS1EWjIwMS0yLUJhc2tldC1UZWNobm9sb2d5LVN0YWlubGVzcy9kcC9CMDk2WDlMR0oxP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTRhLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4ZGZiMGUzNS0wZDU5LTQxYWMtYTZjZC1iOWFmNWE0YmRhZDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQ9JPd0SJI2oWJQSo9MpuTS_3vnKc7tbM4QkD6TcXHGs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNinja-DZ201-2-Basket-Technology-Stainless%2Fdp%2FB096X9LGJ1%3F\">Ninja\u2019s Dual Zone</a> machine can handle two totally different foods simultaneously. Available in 8- and 10-quart capacities, the machine isn\u2019t compact, so it won\u2019t be a good option for those with small kitchens. However, if you have the counter space, it could be the best air fryer to invest in especially if you cook for a large family. You can prep two different foods at the same time with totally different cooking modes, or use Match Cook to prepare foods in both chambers the same way. The heating zones are independent, so if you only want to fill up one side with french fries and leave the other empty, you can do that as well.</p><p>We appreciate how quickly the Ninja heats up (there\u2019s little to no preheating time at all) and how it runs relatively quietly. It also has a feature called Smart Finish that will automatically adjust cooking times so that your chicken thighs in the first chamber and asparagus in the second will finish cooking at the same time, so you don\u2019t have to wait for one part of your meal to be ready while the other gets cold. In general, dual-zone air fryers aren\u2019t necessary for most people, but those who cook often will get a lot of use out of machines like this Ninja.</p><p><em>Nicole Lee and Valentina Palladino contributed to this guide.</em></p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/adaptive-high-definition-headlights-nhtsa-regulations-testing-150034439.html?src=rss", "title": "Adaptive 'high-definition' headlights are just around the corner for American drivers", "date_published": "2022-11-11 15:00:34+00:00", "description": "<p>The first headlights to adorn automobiles weren\u2019t all that much better than squinting real hard and hoping any cows in the road had the good sense to move out of your way.

Until very recently, however, cutting-edge features like that weren\u2019t allowed on vehicles sold in the US due to an NHTSA regulation set in the 1960s. But thanks to a multi-year lobbying effort on the part of Toyota, <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-allow-adaptive-driving-beam-headlights-new-vehicles-improving-safety-drivers\">those regulations changed this last February</a> \u2014 now America\u2019s roadways are about to become a bit brighter and a whole lot safer.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"3095124d087e4b758c553b3095e8683d\"></div><h2>How headlights evolved from open flames to laser pixels</h2><p>Following the short-lived idea of using open flames to light the way, the first electric headlights appeared on the <a href=\"https://www.gm.com/heritage/collection/cadillac/1912-cadillac-model-30\">1912 Cadillac Model 30</a> and, by the next decade, were quickly becoming mandatory equipment across the nation. The first split-intensity headlights offering separate low and high beams were produced in 1915 but wouldn\u2019t be included in a vehicle\u2019s OEM design until in 1924 and the floor-mounted switch that controlled them wouldn\u2019t be invented until three years after that \u2014 a full decade of having to get out of the car just to turn your lights on and blink between brightnesses!</p><p>The advent of <a href=\"https://www.carid.com/articles/brief-history-of-sealed-beam-headlights-in-us.html\">sealed beam headlights</a> with filaments for both low and high beams in 1954, and its widespread adoption by 1957, proved a massive technological leap. With low beams for dusk and evening driving, and high beams for late night travel on otherwise unlit roads, these new headlights would drastically extend the hours of day a car could safely be on the road.</p><p>The first halogen light, which would itself quickly become a global standard, debuted in 1962. But halogens at that time were about as popular in the US as the metric system \u2014 we still preferred tungsten incandescents. That changed with the passage of the Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 and the formation of the National Highway Transportation Authority (the NHTSA) in 1968, which took the existing hodge-podge of state-level vehicular regulations and federalized them, as well as the formal adoption that year of <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2004-title49-vol5/xml/CFR-2004-title49-vol5-sec571-108.xml\">Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 108</a>, which dictated that all headlights be constructed of sealed beams.</p><figure><img alt=\"Close-Up Of  Vintage Car headlight\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/ae844a50-5f93-11ed-bcf5-8c0c2fe5d519\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">kampee patisena via Getty Images</div></figure><p>By the 1970s, halogen bulbs, with their increased brightness and efficiency compared to tungsten incandescents, became the industry standard. The \u201880s, in turn, saw US regulations expand to allow for replaceable-bulb headlamps, which the European market had already been enjoying for a number of years. The ability to swap out a bulb rather than an entire headlight unit, combined with recent material advances that saw lamp lenses constructed out of plastic instead of glass, drastically reduced the cost of making and operating headlights. And by the \u201890s, halogens had themselves fallen to the wayside in favor of modern xenon and LED lighting technologies. The 21st century has seen further advances to not just the lighting technology itself \u2014 hello halo and laser headlights! \u2014  but also the control systems that direct the beams.</p><p>Due to differences in their relative transportation regulations, the rate of technological adoption has diverged between US drivers and their European counterparts \u2014 often with the Americans lagging behind. As with replaceable bulbs in the \u201850s and glare reduction efforts in the \u201830s, Europe has shown itself far more willing to innovate and readily implement recent headlight advances, in part to restrictions imposed by FMVSS 108. Because Standard 108 defined headlights as only having high or low beams \u2014 and legally requiring they remain separate \u2014 it tacitly excluded all of the technical advances that followed, specifically <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-allow-adaptive-driving-beam-headlights-new-vehicles-improving-safety-drivers\">adaptive driving beam</a> (ADB) headlight systems as found in Audi\u2019s matrix LEDs, Lexus\u2019 Blade Scan LEDs or Ford\u2019s Adaptive Front Lighting System, none of which you will currently find operable Stateside.</p><div id=\"56e4370b76fe42258a53dd2f82dca4e0\"></div><p>Those and similar ADB systems have been available in the Europe, Canada and Japan since the technology's debut in 2004 (though, technically, the 1967 Citroen DS did also feature headlights that swivel in sync with the steering). It would be more than a decade \u2014 not until Toyota\u2019s monumental 2015 petition \u2014 before the NHTSA would even consider allowing their use in the North American market. In fact, it took another three years beyond that for the agency\u2019s bureaucratic skullduggery to wrap up and it wasn\u2019t until February of this year \u2014 a year and a half ahead of schedule because they had to satisfy a requirement set forth in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill \u2014 that the NHTSA amended the regulation.</p><p>\u201cNHTSA prioritizes the safety of everyone on our nation\u2019s roads, whether they are inside or outside a vehicle. New technologies can help advance that mission,\u201d Dr. Steven Cliff, NHTSA\u2019s Deputy Administrator, said in a <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-allow-adaptive-driving-beam-headlights-new-vehicles-improving-safety-drivers\">February press release</a>. \u201cNHTSA is issuing this final rule to help improve safety and protect vulnerable road users.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdaptive driving beam headlight systems, or ADB, use automatic headlight beam switching technology to shine less light on occupied areas of the road and more light on unoccupied areas,\u201d the NHTSA further explained. \u201cThe adaptive beam is particularly useful for distance illumination of pedestrians, animals, and objects without reducing the visibility of drivers in other vehicles.\u201d</p><h2>How Adaptive Driving Beams bend light around rain</h2><p>Broadly, ADB are headlights that actively adapt to the prevailing weather conditions such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDT756kQrCI\">redirecting light around falling rain and snow</a>, extending them ahead of turns or dimming the high beams towards oncoming vehicles only. These systems often leverage the same forward-facing cameras used by the adaptive cruise control system and can be programmed to not just illuminate the road ahead but display prescient navigation information as well.</p><div id=\"cda1f4c8866843a0bcd15810c580c05b\"></div><p>Audi outside of the US, for example, offers <a href=\"https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/audi-technology-lexicon-7180/lighting-7187\">Digital matrix LED headlights</a> \u2014 LEDs arrayed in a grid pattern and granularly controlled by a central processor called a DMD (digital micromirror device). They operate much like the digital projection technology they\u2019re based on.</p><p>\u201dAt its heart is a small chip containing one million micromirrors, each of whose edge length measures just a few hundredths of a millimeter,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/audi-technology-lexicon-7180/lighting-7187\">Audi\u2019s Lighting page</a> explains. \u201dWith the help of electrostatic fields, each individual micromirror can be tilted up to 5,000 times per second. Depending on the setting, the LED light is either directed via the lenses onto the road or is absorbed in order to mask out areas of the light beam.\u201d</p><p>Those masked areas are where the light isn\u2019t bouncing off falling water or glaring into the eyes of other drivers. What\u2019s more, the system will project \u201cdynamic leaving- and coming-home animations\u201d onto nearby surfaces, as a treat. More practically, the system can angle the beams to illuminate farther into turns.</p><p>Similarly, the HD Matrix LED system found on later model year A8s, under specific circumstances, will dim the vehicle\u2019s high beams without any human intervention. When the headlights are set to Automatic, the vehicle is going over 18 mph outside of urban areas (as dictated by the navigation system), and the front camera sees an another vehicle, the headlights will darken and dim individual LEDs in 64 stages \u2014 roughly several million potential patterns \u2014 to \u201cmask out other vehicles while continuing to fully illuminate the zones between and adjacent to them.\u201d</p><p>Ford\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klkqOO7EaW0\">high-resolution Adaptive Front Lighting System</a>, which debuted in Europe this past August, offers similar capabilities. The company notes that roughly 40 percent of accidents occur on UK roads after sundown. Glancing down at bright infotainment displays while on dark roads can temporarily blind drivers, so Ford\u2019s headlights will project speed limits, navigation cues and road hazard warnings onto the road itself. What\u2019s more, the beams can \u201cbend\u201d around corners and penetrate fog, rain and other inclement weather conditions.</p><div id=\"de3ddcd7f2fe43d0869e22a068a220ee\"></div><p>\u201cWhat started as playing around with a projector light and a blank wall could take lighting technologies to a whole new level,\u201d Ford engineer Lars Junker said in <a href=\"https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2022/08/15/ford-headlight-tech-helps-keep-drivers-eyes-on-the-road-.html\">a press release</a>. \u201cThere\u2019s the potential now to do so much more than simply illuminate the road ahead, to help reduce the stress involved in driving at night. The driver could get essential information without ever needing to take their eyes off the road.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://group.mercedes-benz.com/innovation/specials/geneva-2018/digital-light.html\">Mercedes\u2019 Digital Light system</a>, on the other hand, uses a unique light module consisting of three LEDs mounted in each headlamp. Their light is reflected by a thumbnail-sized array of some 1.3 million micromirrors, each of which is controlled via an onboard graphics processor to precisely bend and attenuate the beams. According to Mercedes, that fidelity enables its Highbeam Assist to function two magnitudes more precisely in excluding oncoming traffic than conventional 84-pixel arrays.</p><div id=\"3041d404f12147fc866db4d7037c513a\"></div><p>At the other end of the spectrum, <a href=\"https://mag.lexus.co.uk/how-does-lexus-bladescan-headlight-work/\">Lexus\u2019 Blade Scan</a> high-definition headlights, which debuted in Asian markets in 2019, only utilize 24 LEDs per headlight. Rather than an array of micromirrors, Lexus uses a pair of rapidly-rotating mirrors to direct their light through the lens and onto the road. Per the company, this allows the system to aim with 0.7 degrees of accuracy and detect pedestrians at the roadside up to 184 feet away.</p><p>Unfortunately, for as cool as these capabilities are and as technically legal as they are, American drivers still have a short wait before they come stateside. That's because the NHTSA must now devise a set of testing requirements by which to measure and regulate adaptive headlights under the revised standard. In the short term, it means we\u2019ll likely see more new vehicles equipped with ADB-capable-but-disabled hardware that can be activated over-the-air later on, once the regulations have firmed up.</p><p>\u201cWhile adaptive headlights have been approved, the testing requirements for approval put forth by NHTSA is still under discussion,\u201d an Audi representative told Engadget. \u201cBecause of this, [I\u2019m] afraid we are still not able to offer the matrix functionality in the US at this time and continue to work with regulators to bring this safety relevant function to market.\u201d</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/magic-leap-2-ar-headset-tech-dive-143046676.html?src=rss", "title": "Magic Leap 2 is the best AR headset yet, but will an enterprise focus save the company?", "date_published": "2022-11-11 14:30:46+00:00", "description": "<p>Magic Leap's glasses were supposed to lead us into the augmented reality era, a world beyond screens where we could interact with digital objects as if they were standing right next to us.

According to Curtis, bumping up the field of view from 50 degrees to 70 degrees with ML1's projector and eyepiece technology would have required wearing something as large as an open hand. That's not exactly doable all day.</p><figure><img alt=\"Magic Leap 2\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/1ef233a0-612f-11ed-bf59-cbf851fa9130\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Magic Leap</div></figure><p>Magic Leap spent years exploring existing forms of projection, including laser-scan based systems, uLED arrays and LCoS (liquid crystal on silicon), but found them all lacking. Instead, it developed its own custom architecture, which uses LCoS together with LED RGB light modules and a complex system of concentrators and polarizers to bring images to your eyes. That works together with a new eyepiece design to achieve its lofty 70 degree field of view.</p><p>But what does that actually mean? The Magic Leap 1 headset featured a FOV of 50 degrees, which made it seem as if you were viewing AR through a car's cramped rear window. (That was comparable to HoloLens 2's 52 degrees of viewing.) With Magic Leap 2, the company hit a 70 degree FOV by increasing the vertical viewing area, allowing you to see taller objects without moving your head up and down. During my brief demo, it felt more like standing in front of an open doorway.</p><figure><img alt=\"Magic Leap 2\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/1eed9fc0-612f-11ed-bfa5-e14944a33767\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Magic Leap</div></figure><p>That's more akin to how you view things in real life, according to Curtis, and it goes a long way towards convincing you the AR objects you're seeing are real. I've tried a wide variety of headsets over the years (including the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-12-meta-2-ar-headset.html\">defunct entry from the startup Meta</a>, which existed long before Facebook's name change), and the Magic Leap 2 is the first one that's delivered a genuine sense of presence. Whether I was viewing a large piece of medical equipment, or an expansive 3D model of downtown San Diego, I had to try hard to see the edges. It was almost aggressively immersive.</p><p>The new projection technology also helped Magic Leap achieve its goal of reducing ML2's volume by more than half, leading to a 20 percent weight drop (it clocks in at just 260 grams, slightly more than half a pound). The result is a pair of AR glasses that feel more like, well, <em>glasses</em>. While the original headset looked like a pair of enormous ski goggles, ML2 has flatter lenses and slimmer arms, making you seem less like a bug-eyed dork and more like an engineer or surgeon gearing up for a big project. (It's no wonder Magic Leap <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/magic-leap-2-early-access-program-192759568.html\">gave health startups a headstart</a> with access to its new hardware and software.)</p><p>All of this custom development will also help Magic Leap deliver better headsets down the line. The company claims its eventual Magic Leap 3 glasses, which have no release date yet, will lose another 50 percent in volume and deliver a larger field of view. The technology can potentially be scaled beyond 80 degrees, allowing you to view a building-sized object unencumbered by any AR boundaries.</p><section><img alt=\"Wearing Magic Leap 2 goggles with compute pack \" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/9d1452c0-6131-11ed-ad2e-4e5ccb57bc8c\" /></section><p>As I started demoing the Magic Leap 2 in a brightly lit hotel meeting room, it was mostly what I expected: A more comfortable and higher quality version of its predecessor. But at one point, I hit a button and the screen started to go dark, as if a shadowy cloud was blotting out the sickly fluorescent lights above me. I had flipped on the headset's global dimmer, which darkens the real world to better highlight virtual objects. The result is an almost VR-like experience. The virtual map I was viewing, which showed how first responders were dealing with wildfires in Colorado, all of a sudden looked sharper and more colorful. I wasn't distracted by the boring meeting desk in front of me, or the occasional bystander walking by.</p><p>Every AR solution adds light, Curtis explained, what's unique about ML2 is that it's able to add the color black. The dimmer module is another display that sits in front of the headset's eyepiece, allowing it to reduce light across the entire screen, or into specific areas, by a factor of 100. That'll let you use ML2 in brightly lit rooms, or even outside on a sunny day, without making the AR images seem washed out. Developers can also use the dimmer to add shadows to their objects, giving you an added layer of depth in AR.</p><p></p><figure><img alt=\"Magic Leap 2 controller\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/9d142bb0-6131-11ed-bf6b-eeaabee3fad9\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>As Magic Leap was working on making AR more VR-like, Meta was also doubling down on bringing the real world into VR with the Quest Pro. Thanks to new cameras and upgraded hardware, Meta is pitching that headset as a way to bring VR elements into your typical workflow (just imagine viewing VR windows dancing above your laptop's screen). Based on my time with the Quest Pro so far, that's not something I'd actually want much of. The cameras just aren't good enough yet. But it's funny to see Meta tackling a similar problem as Magic Leap from another angle. Somewhere between these two headsets is the ideal balance between the immersion of VR, and the real world integration of AR.</p><p>I was so distracted by Magic Leap 2's expanded field of view and dimming capabilities, I barely noticed that its controller felt more ergonomic. And I didn't think much of the headset's computing pack, which can now be worn across your body like a messenger bag. Naturally, it has faster hardware inside (specifically, a quad-core AMD Zen 2 processor and RDNA 2 graphics). But my main takeaway, after years of AR and VR testing, and the seemingly endless drumbeat of metaverse hype from an increasingly desperate Mark Zuckerberg, is that it\u2019s nice to be genuinely surprised by a new headset.</p><figure><img alt=\"Magic Leap 2\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/66c37ce0-6132-11ed-a77b-c5175df9bbf7\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Magic Leap</div></figure><p>But of course, tech alone won't make a successful product. Magic Leap isn't targeting ML2 towards consumers at all, instead it's being pitched to doctors who may want a bit of AR assistance during surgery, or engineers who would like to pull up schematics when they're standing in front of complex machinery.</p><p>\"I think it's improved a lot, [Magic Leap is a] different company,\" said Chief Marketing Officer Daniel Diez, when I asked about the state of Magic Leap today. Amid dismal sales of its first headset, and increasingly dire financials, founder and CEO Rony Abovitz left in 2020. But now, thanks to more than $1 billion in additional funding and a new leader in Peggy Johnson, it has another shot at the AR market.</p><p>At the very least, it\u2019s clear the metaverse isn\u2019t a problem Meta can solve on its own. Magic Leap is one of the few established competitors out there, making it a company that\u2019s still worth watching. And if the enterprise play doesn\u2019t work out, there\u2019s a chance a large company like Google (one of its original investors) may have some use for all of this AR tech.</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/control-2-announcement-platforms-141548453.html?src=rss", "title": "Remedy confirms 'Control 2' is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC", "date_published": "2022-11-11 14:15:48+00:00", "description": "<p>Remedy has yet to show its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/control-spin-off-multiplayer-co-op-remedy-505-191228046.html\">co-op <em>Control</em> spinoff</a>, but that isn't stopping the developer from unveiling a true follow-up.

Yes, it\u2019s cute, but that\u2019s only one reason to buy it over others. I like that it\u2019s quite accurate and provides temperature readings in just a couple of seconds, plus it's splash resistant and pretty easy to clean. It also has a screen that you can rotate to show you the temperature in different orientations, making it easy to use in all kinds of positions. Plus, you can\u2019t beat its $35 price tag, which is a steal for an accurate thermometer like this that also has an attractive, pocketable design. If you want the latest and great, spring for the ThermoPop 2 that just came out, which is even more accurate than the previous generation, faster and can read temperatures up to 572 degrees Fahrenheit. <em>\u2014 Valentina Palladino, Senior Commerce Editor</em></p><a class=\"athena-button rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8ec42127-5c25-4160-a755-9edb36e27b1b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=ThermoWorks&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4ZWM0MjEyNy01YzI1LTQxNjAtYTc1NS05ZWRiMzZlMjdiMWIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcm1vd29ya3MuY29tL3RoZXJtb3BvcC0yLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGUzOTQyZTgtYzJmMS00Y2FkLWFjZjctN2M0ZDM4MDU0MTZiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAY1mUN8usRyTRTrrjMx6SSy0QH1_3Wqv_y6MqggalJv9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thermoworks.com%2Fthermopop-2%2F\" id=\"7a9c58091df34a639c9a829bef6d82bc\">Buy ThermoPop 2 at ThermoWorks - $35</a><h2>John Boos cutting board</h2><figure><img alt=\"John Boos cutting board\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/bec4d9d0-59e8-11ed-bfd3-497bc2ad7753\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">John Boos</div></figure><p>Anyone who has watched even a handful of cooking shows or videos has probably seen this cutting board in the background.

DeviantArt is now getting into the space with a generator of its own called <a href=\"https://www.dreamup.com/\">DreamUp</a>, promising \"safe and fair\" generation for creators. The website says one of artists' main concerns about AI art is that their work may be used to train artificial intelligence models, which means the generator could spit out pieces in their style without their consent. In an attempt to give artists control over their work, DeviantArt is giving them the ability to choose whether or not the tool can use their style for direct inspiration.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, the website is giving them the power to declare whether or not to allow their work to be used in datasets used to train third-party AI models. If they choose not to be included in those datasets, their content pages' HTML files will contain a \"noimageai\" directive. Also a \"noai\" directive protects their artwork when media files are directly downloaded from DeviantArt's servers.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>\"DeviantArt encourages other creator platforms to adopt this approach in order to ensure artists remain able to share their work with online audiences while retaining control over non-human usage,\" the website wrote in its announcement.&nbsp;</p><p>Those directives, of course, won't be added to their pages' HTML files if they're cool with their work being used to train AI models. And if they choose to allow DreamUp to use their style as a direct inspiration, they will be \"clearly credited\" on the output when it's published on DeviantArt. The website has anticipated that some users wouldn't be happy seeing even more AI art, though, especially since Midjourney-generated pieces are already <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/09/ai-art-is-here-and-the-world-is-already-different.html\">a very common sight on the platform</a>. That's why all DreamUp submissions will be automatically tagged as #AIArt, and users will be able to choose to see or to hide posts under the topic.&nbsp;</p><p>DreamUp is now one of the perks for DeviantArt's paid Core subscription plans, but all users can sample the tool with up to five free prompts.&nbsp;</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-learning-thermostat-deal-179-at-wellbots-134858404.html?src=rss", "title": "Google's Nest Learning Thermostat is on sale for $179 right now", "date_published": "2022-11-11 13:48:58+00:00", "description": "<p>Google's <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f14f6b23-c078-4e53-8011-5b872f886d6b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Wellbots&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmMTRmNmIyMy1jMDc4LTRlNTMtODAxMS01Yjg3MmY4ODZkNmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2VsbGJvdHMuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2dvb2dsZS1uZXN0LWxlYXJuaW5nLXRoZXJtb3N0YXQtM3JkLWdlbmVyYXRpb24iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImEwNzA0ZGVkLTNkODItNDkwMC1iYmJhLWJkNzFkNTFlNjdmNyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARwRS4BwRuyEFoaTbNUNv9KKlcUPDZgbeih23SxrJC_0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellbots.com%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle-nest-learning-thermostat-3rd-generation\">Nest Learning Thermostat</a> is broadly regarded as one of the best smart thermostats you can buy, and right now Wellbots is running a sale that brings the device <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f14f6b23-c078-4e53-8011-5b872f886d6b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Wellbots&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmMTRmNmIyMy1jMDc4LTRlNTMtODAxMS01Yjg3MmY4ODZkNmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2VsbGJvdHMuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2dvb2dsZS1uZXN0LWxlYXJuaW5nLXRoZXJtb3N0YXQtM3JkLWdlbmVyYXRpb24iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImEwNzA0ZGVkLTNkODItNDkwMC1iYmJhLWJkNzFkNTFlNjdmNyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARwRS4BwRuyEFoaTbNUNv9KKlcUPDZgbeih23SxrJC_0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellbots.com%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle-nest-learning-thermostat-3rd-generation\">down to $179</a> when you use the code <strong>THERMOENG </strong>at checkout.

One of Engadget's editors tried it out on his iPad and got a notification that says it will be available in his country in the future, even though he's in the US, which is one of the service's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blocks-new-accounts-twitter-blue-114446338.html\">launch locations</a>.

Its main draw at the moment is instant verification, and people quickly latched onto the idea that it can be used to create parody or fake accounts that look legitimate.

In addition, the website <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-starts-doling-out-official-checkmarks-again-045618923.html\">rolled out its \"Official\" gray</a> checkmarks to select notable accounts and public figures earlier.

So when I heard that Eight Sleep was coming out with a new version of its smart mattress topper that offers better sleep tracking and temperature controls, I was curious to see how well it worked. And while the Pod 3 Cover is pricey, after a few months of testing, I never want to go back to a regular standalone mattress.</p><h2>The Eight Sleep system</h2><p>The company's core offerings consist of two main components: The Pod 3 Mattress and the Pod 3 Cover. The mattress itself is relatively straightforward. Its features a medium firmness that's a bit stiffer than something like the original Leesa mattress and it includes various additional layers for better heat distribution.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"The Pod 3 Cover works with both Eight Sleep's mattress or the bed you already own via the company's PerfectFit encasement. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/25664550-612f-11ed-afd7-dd281648ade9\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Then there's the Eight Sleep Pod 3 cover, which is both the heart and the brains of the company's two-pronged approach. In order to deliver your perfect sleep temperature, the cover features what Eight Sleep calls an Active Grid, which is essentially embedded tubing that carries cool or warm water to your side of the bed. There are also sensors built into the Active Grid that can monitor things like your heart rate, sleeping respiratory rate, how much you toss and turn and more, with Eight Sleep claiming that the Pod 3 offers significantly more accurate tracking than its previous offerings. And then attached to the Active Grid is the Hub, which serves both as a reservoir for the water in the Pod Cover and as a place to house important tech like WiFi, which unlike previous models now supports 5GHz networks.</p><h2>Setup</h2><p>While the thought of having to plug wires and hoses into your bed might seem like a bit much, getting everything working is actually pretty simple. Like a lot of foam mattresses, Eight Sleep's option arrived compressed in a box \u2014 all you have to do is remove the plastic wrapper and give it a few minutes while it expands. The nice thing is that you don't need to buy one from Eight Sleep at all, as the Pod Cover is designed to work pretty much any mattress up to 16 inches thick.</p><figure><img alt=\"The Pod Cover's Hub functions as a reservoir for sending cold or hot water to your bed and also houses important components like built-in WiFi.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/50a0b520-612f-11ed-bfff-a201ddf1ab8f\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>That's because while the standard Pod Cover comes with zippers that line up with matching teeth on the company's mattress, you can also order the Pod Cover with PerfectFit, which includes an encasement that accommodates third-party beds. So if you already like your current mattress, you don't need to toss it to install the Pod Cover. Not only does this lower the price of entry, it's also a welcome move toward general flexibility. Which is good because <em>starting</em> at $2,045 (for a full), this thing definitely ain't cheap.</p><p>Once the Pod Cover is attached to your mattress, Eight Sleep's app provides simple step-by-step instructions on how to connect the hose, fill the reservoir and power it up. Admittedly, there's not a lot to mess up (aside from maybe not leaving enough room behind your bed to prevent the hose from kinking), but the guide removes all the guesswork. And while the hub itself does take up a little space, the hose is long enough that it's not too difficult to find a spot for it. From there, you can set up or sign into your account, enter your WiFi info and that's it. All told, it took me less than 20 minutes to put everything together after unboxing it.</p><h2>The tech</h2><figure><img alt=\"The Pod Cover uses a variety of sensors to track things like your sleeping heart rate, respiratory rate and more. And in the morning you get a full report along with a daily sleep score. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/8c749080-612f-11ed-beb7-a60903499d06\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>While the Pod 3 Cover isn't a huge departure from previous models, it does pretty much everything really well. The sensors made easy work of tracking my sleeping heart and respiratory rates. And thanks to charts and graphs that are available inside the app, it's easy to see how various factors impact your sleep. You even have the ability to add tags for things like stretching, caffeine intake and others to better correlate your daytime activities with the amount of rest you get. And every day, the app spits out a sleep score to tell you how you did.</p><p>The other big part of the Pod Cover's kit is its heating and cooling tech. The cover supports dual-zone controls, so you can set the temp for each half of the bed independently. That's really nice because while I typically prefer things on the cool side, my wife is often chilly at night and has her side set to warm. Honestly, even without all the sleep tracking, the Pod Cover is worth it for its cooling and heating alone.</p><figure><img alt=\"In the Eight Sleep app, you can set your beds temperature to various degrees of hot or cold, while the optional Autopilot features (which requires a $19 monthly subscription) can adjust temperatures automatically. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/0df97490-6130-11ed-bbbb-215dd5358484\" /><figcaption>In the Eight Sleep app, you can adjust the Pod Cover's temperature settings manually or let the Autopilot feature make suggestions automatically, though sadly you'll need to pay for the company's $19-a-month subscription for the latter. </figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>At this point, the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3427038/\">science is pretty clear</a>, your thermal environment has a huge impact on how well you sleep. Too hot or too cold and you're almost certainly going to wake up feeling less rested. But with the Pod Cover, you can select your perfect temp and set a schedule for controlling heating and cooling levels throughout the night. For me, it's like laying on the cool side of the pillow, except all the time and across the entire mattress, which makes a huge difference in both how fast I fall asleep and how I feel the next morning.</p><p>Of course, you can change things as needed, which really came in handy when I started running a fever. So instead of having my side cold as normal, I was able to pump up the heat to help combat the chills \u2014 something that made being sick just a bit more tolerable. In less extreme circumstances, the adjustability also means you can tailor your temps depending on the season, as I found I prefer things a bit colder in the summer and a bit warmer in the fall and winter.</p><p>On top of that, Eight Sleep takes its temperature control and sleep tracking tech a couple steps further with its Autopilot and Sleep Insight features. Autopilot uses data gathered by its sensors to automatically make your bed hotter or colder as needed. In my case, after noticing in the summer I was tossing and turning more often, it suggested a slightly cooler temperature schedule, which later resulted in higher sleep scores.</p><figure><img alt=\"By tracking various metrics including heart rate, the Pod Cover can notify you when you had a particularly good (or bad) night of sleep. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/9f0283a0-6130-11ed-bf7f-7c32f1ab8b85\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>But what might be even more powerful is Sleep Insights, which are observations based on your metrics that tell you how well (or badly) you slept. It's kind of like a robo-coach that sorts through your data to provide tips so you don't have to. While reports generally amount to notifications about your sleeping heart rate being higher or lower than normal, I appreciate that it calls attention to things like eating late or having a drink or two before bed which can negatively impact your sleep. Annoyingly, both Autopilot and Sleep Insight are locked behind the company's optional <a href=\"https://blog.eightsleep.com/the-eight-sleep-8-pro-membership/?amp\">8+ Pro subscription</a> that costs $19 a month, which is frankly just too much. I know companies these days are looking for steady revenue streams, but these features really ought to be free.</p><h2>Comfort</h2><h2></h2><p>Of course, all the fancy tech in the world doesn't mean much if this thing is uncomfortable, and thankfully it's not. It's actually quite the opposite. One of my gripes about the original Pod Cover is that you could feel the tubing inside. But on the Pod 3, you can only tell that it's more than a dumb mattress topper when you touch it with your hands; laying on it, the tubing is almost impossible to discern. Admittedly, the topper makes your mattress feel a touch firmer than it would otherwise, but aside from that, it feels a lot like a bed with a thin foam egg crate pad \u2013 just slightly pillowy.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt=\"The Pod Cover features a relatively streamlined design, though you will need to find space to position its water hose and spot for the hub. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/c77c9060-612f-11ed-8ff7-5671615a34d6\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>The thing that made me realize what a huge impact the Pod 3 Cover had on my sleep was how much I missed it while traveling. Even the softest, coziest hotel bed couldn't make up for the lack of temperature controls. Other additions like the Pod Cover's upgraded WiFi make the smart topper even easier to set up while more precise sleep tracking helps you better figure how well you\u2019re sleeping and what you can do to improve.</p><p>The only real downside (and it's kind of a big one) is that with a starting price of over $2,100, it\u2019s out of the reach of most people. And that doesn't even include the optional 8+ Pro subscription, which feels like an unnecessary tax required to unlock all of its features. That said, even without Autopilot and Sleep Insights, the Pod 3 Cover has delivered some of the best sleep I've ever had.</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-apple-puts-a-10-minute-cap-on-receiving-air-drop-transfers-in-china-121520565.html?src=rss", "title": "The Morning After: Apple introduces AirDrop limit in China", "date_published": "2022-11-11 12:15:20+00:00", "description": "<p>The latest iOS update Apple rolled out in China came with something not included in the release for other regions.

The tragic Challenger flight took off on January 28th, 1986, breaking apart only 73 seconds into its journey.

The <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/amazon-prime-air-delivery-drone-reveal-photos\">MK30</a> was designed to be lighter than the current model dubbed MK27-2.

Amazon will be using MK27-2 for those tests \u2014 this model won't be in service until 2024. The company says MK30 has a longer range than the MK27-2, has a higher temperature tolerance and has the capability to fly in light rain.

For the rest of us who don't want to void the warranty, though, Hong Kong-based Unitek is now offering the <a href=\"https://www.unitek-products.com/products/cooling-dock-pro\">Cooler Dock Pro</a> for Steam Deck. This is essentially Valve's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-dock-reservations-preorder-valve-182653344.html\">official dock</a> boosted with a thermoelectric cooler on the back, if you don't mind paying the extra $30.</p><figure><img alt=\"Unitek Cooling Dock Pro for Steam Deck\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/92862d50-6123-11ed-9c8b-b669fa4cfd94\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>Much like the official dock, Unitek's version cushions your Steam Deck \u2014 or any portable device, for that matter \u2014 with a strip of soft silicone, and there's a short USB-C cable dangling from the back for connecting to the console. The thermoelectric cooler, RGB-lit fan and metallic contact plate are all housed within a hinged module, which allows for minor tilt angle adjustment while supporting the Steam Deck.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Cooler Dock Pro comes with a set of ports similar to those on Valve's dock, but with some placed at the front instead \u2014 the latter include two USB-A and one USB-C (up to 10Gbps), accompanied with two RGB lights. On the back, you get a USB-C PD socket (up to 100W passthrough), HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4 and Gigabit LAN. It's worth noting that this dock supports Multi-Stream Transport i.e. daisy-chaining multiple monitors in the console's Linux desktop mode. If you're using just one video output, you'll get up to 8K at 60Hz or 4K at 120Hz; but if you're using both ports, then it's either dual 4K at 60Hz, or 8K at 30Hz on one and 1080p at 60Hz on the other.</p><p>Unitek has added one extra USB-C port on the left, which is dedicated to the cooler module. If you want to use <em>just</em> the cooling function while on the go i.e. no displays nor accessories connected to the dock, you can simply plug a power bank into that 10W USB-C socket.</p><figure><img alt=\"Unitek Cooling Dock Pro for Steam Deck\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/01de3490-6124-11ed-bdec-ae4270f987f2\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>Unitek claims that while running <em>Apex Legends</em>, the Steam Deck's average surface temperature was around 46\u00b0C (114.8\u00b0F), but when used with the Cooling Dock Pro, this figure dropped down to 34.5\u00b0C (94.1\u00b0F) \u2014 falling within the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1549467955754217473\">recommended</a> ambient temperature range. For a more extreme test, we ran <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> on ultra graphics settings, in which case the Steam Deck would normally fail to start a race, but it managed to last for around six minutes on the Cooling Dock Pro. The company added that when lowered to high graphics settings, the game would crash after around 45 minutes of gameplay, but with its dock, it kept running even after an hour. Of course, your mileage may vary from one game to another, but it's more about prolonging your Steam Deck's lifespan.</p><p>The $119 Unitek Cooling Dock Pro is now available for <a href=\"https://www.unitek-products.com/products/cooling-dock-pro\">pre-order</a>, with shipments starting from around mid-December. There's also a cheaper $89 <a href=\"https://www.unitek-products.com/products/cooling-dock\">Cooling Dock</a> for those who only need an HDMI 2.0 port (capped at 4K at 60Hz). It should be noted that there's no power supply included with either model (but they do come with a 2-meter 100W USB-C cable), while Valve's $89 official dock includes a 45W brick. Chances are you may already have a compatible power supply; Unitek recommends that you'll need 60W or above to get the most out of the Cooler Dock Pro.</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/un-global-methane-detection-system-070057307.html?src=rss", "title": "UN initiative will use satellites to detect methane emission hotspots", "date_published": "2022-11-11 07:00:57+00:00", "description": "<p>The United Nations is betting that satellites could help the world <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/un-emissions-gap-report-climate-change-warning-144323723.html\">catch up on emissions reductions</a>.

It'll gradually expand to include less powerful sources, more frequent alerts and data from animals, coal, rice and waste.

As human-released methane is both a major contributor to climate change (about 25 percent, the UN says) and quick to leave the atmosphere, an effective use of MARS could help get environmental strategy back on track.</p><p>As you might imagine, though, MARS will only work if governments and businesses cooperate. There's not much point to alerts if emissions contributors ignore them. An oil company might be reluctant to spend the money need to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/methane-flaring-oil-extraction-worse-emissions-134504251.html\">fix its flaring</a>, for instance.
