<p>Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts is calling on Congress to pass new legislation to rein in Big Tech companies after Elon Musk ignored an information request. “Elon Musk could respond to my tweets but failed to respond to my letter by yesterday’s deadline and answer basic questions about Twitter verification,” Markey <a href="https://twitter.com/SenMarkey/status/1596523892361007105?s=20&amp;t=u1NxSX8dQHmVaCdJ7-r-3Q"><ins>tweeted Saturday</ins></a>. “Congress must end the era of failed Big Tech self-regulation and pass laws that put user safety over the whims of billionaires.”</p><p>Musk had until November 25th to answer a letter the senator sent on November 11th about Twitter’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-subscriptions-not-working-134310199.html"><ins>paid account verification feature</ins></a>. The initial rollout of the new Twitter Blue saw trolls use the service to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-verification-impersonation-disaster-203656712.html"><ins>impersonate celebrities, politicians and brands</ins></a>. Markey <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senator-markey-twitter-elon-musk-letter-223210329.html"><ins>sent Musk a list of questions</ins></a> about the launch after <em>The Washington Post </em>created a “verified” account impersonating him. One day after Markey shared a copy of the letter on Twitter, Musk attacked the senator.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="21bb3b50c10949d6b9513031d8ffce1c"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">.<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@elonmusk</a> could respond to my tweets but failed to respond to my letter by yesterday’s deadline and answer basic questions about Twitter verification.

The exchange <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senator-ed-markey-tells-elon-musk-fix-your-companies-215557841.html"><ins>prompted Markey to chastise the billionaire</ins></a>. “One of your companies is under an FTC consent decree. Auto safety watchdog NHTSA is investigating another for killing people. And you’re spending your time picking fights online,” the senator said. “Fix your companies. Or Congress will.”</p><p>As of the writing of this article, Musk has yet to respond to Markey’s latest tweet. It’s hard to say whether the senator’s call will translate to legislative action, particularly with a split between the House of Representatives and Senate. Musk did appear to answer at least one of Markey’s questions when he announced Twitter’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-colored-badges-verified-accounts-094651616.html"><ins>new verification system on Friday</ins></a>. The latest iteration of the program will feature manual authentication and different colored check marks for different types of users. "Gold check for companies, grey check for government, blue for individuals (celebrity or not) and all verified accounts will be manually authenticated before check activates," he said.</p>

<p>Fifteen years after the release of the iPhone, it’s easy to overlook the role early innovators like Palm played in popularizing the smartphone. By the time HP unceremoniously shut down the company in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-02-09-rip-palm-1992-2011.html"><ins>2011</ins></a>, Palm had struggled for a few years to carve out a niche for itself among Apple and Google. But ask anyone who had a chance to use a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-04-01-usrobotics-palmpilot-personal-review.html"><ins>Palm PDA</ins></a> in the late ‘90s or early 2000s and they’ll tell you how fondly they remember the hardware and software that made the company’s vision possible. Now, it’s easier than ever to see what made Palm OS so special back in its day.</p><p>This week, archivist Jason Scott uploaded a database of Palm OS apps to the <a href="https://t.co/ye9z4iTPsx"><ins>Internet Archive</ins></a>. In all, there are about 560 programs to check out, including old favorites like <a href="https://archive.org/details/palm3_DopeWars2.4.6"><ins>DopeWars</ins></a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/palm3_SpaceTrader"><ins>SpaceTrader</ins></a>. Even if you don’t have any nostalgia for Palm, it’s well worth spending a few minutes with the collection to see how much – or, in some cases, little – things have changed since Palm OS was a dominant player in the market.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="cc99cc3005c94ee5ab56c117c56db265"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hey, so, don't tell anyone, but I'm announcing PalmPilot emulation at Internet Archive for the holidays, probably next week.

There’s still some work to be done. Specifically, some of the more obscure apps are missing descriptions and metadata. Scott also hopes to write instructions for each program. Still, short of buying an old Palm device off of eBay, this is the best way to experience a bygone computing era. That's because <a href="https://cloudpilot-emu.github.io/"><ins>CloudpilotEmu</ins></a> allows you to navigate through Palm OS. You can even launch the database from your phone and there's full support for Palm's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti_(Palm_OS)">Graffiti handwriting recognition system</a>. If you want to help Scott with the project, <a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1595592145276223489?s=20&amp;t=gJweXOZq8alNlLH7rdgI3Q"><ins>contact him on Twitter or Discord</ins></a>.</p>

## NASA’s Orion spacecraft breaks Apollo 13 flight record

<p>The Artemis 1 Orion crew vehicle has set a new record for a NASA flight. At approximately 8:40AM ET on Saturday, Orion flew farther than any spacecraft designed to carry human astronauts had ever before, surpassing the previous record set by Apollo 13 back in 1970. As of 10:17AM ET, Orion was approximately 249,666 miles ( from 401,798 kilometers) from Earth.</p><p>"Artemis I was designed to stress the systems of Orion and we settled on the distant retrograde orbit as a really good way to do that," <a href="https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1595145041185759232?s=20&amp;t=-bcU6iz46_TBhQi-FJitAw">said Jim Geffre</a>, Orion spacecraft integration manager. “It just so happened that with that really large orbit, high altitude above the moon, we were able to pass the Apollo 13 record. But what was more important though, was pushing the boundaries of exploration and sending spacecraft farther than we had ever done before."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="32ba3dc8fe304903a4df07ab179348c2"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Mission Time: 10 days, 8  hrs, 27  min<br />Orion is 249,666 miles from Earth, 53,687 miles from the Moon, cruising at 2,054 miles per hour.<br />P: (94960, -206242, -113015)<br />V: (2045, 192, -45)<br />O: 287º, 140.6º, 135.7º<br />What's this? <a href="https://t.co/voR4yGgqXG">https://t.co/voR4yGgqXG</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrackArtemis?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TrackArtemis</a><a href="https://t.co/w0uFgDqWaQ">pic.twitter.com/w0uFgDqWaQ</a></p>— Orion Spacecraft (@NASA_Orion) <a href="https://twitter.com/NASA_Orion/status/1596523470782812160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>Of all the missions that could have broken the record, it’s fitting that Artemis 1 was the one to do it.

It was only after a mid-mission explosion forced NASA to plot a new return course that Apollo 13’s Odyssey command module set the previous record at 248,655 miles (400,171 kilometers) from Earth.</p><p>With a limited oxygen supply on the Aquarius Lunar Module, NASA needed to get Apollo 13 back to Earth as quickly as possible. The agency eventually settled on a flight path that used the Moon’s gravity to slingshot Apollo 13 back to Earth. One of the NASA personnel who was critical to the safe return of astronauts Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise was <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/moonikin/arturo-campos"><ins>Arturo Campos</ins></a>. He wrote the emergency plan that gave the Command and Service Module enough power to make it back to Earth. Artemis 1 is carrying a “<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/public-names-moonikin-flying-around-moon-on-nasa-s-artemis-i-mission"><ins>Moonikin</ins></a>” test dummy named after the late Arturo.</p><p>Earlier this week, Orion completed a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-orion-moon-flyby-artemis-1-182736221.html"><ins>flyby of the Moon</ins></a>. After the spacecraft completes half an orbit around the satellite, it will slingshot itself toward the Earth. NASA expects Orion to splash down off the coast of San Diego on December 11th.</p>

It's the most attractive in iRobot's lineup, with a sleek design that can get into room corners more easily than other models, and a tall, slim clean base. It has 40x the suction power of a standard Roomba, making it a great option for households with pets and kids. It's "careful driver" feature uses a 3D sensor to detect objects so it can move around them to clean, and like all Roombas, it will automatically return to its charging base when it's low on power.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In our testing, we found the s9+ to be an incredibly capable cleaner, and while on the loud side, it's no more noisy than other robo-vacs in this price range. When emptying its bin into its clean base, it was actually not as loud as the Roomba j7, so it's less likely to scare your pets while doing so. The clean base does use proprietary bags from iRobot, though, so just keep in mind that you'll have to consistently buy those in order to make full use of the s9+. Thankfully, each bag can hold up to 60 days worth of debris.</p><p>The Roomba s9+ also connects to iRobot's mobile app, from which you can control the machine, set cleaning schedules and more. It's one of the easier robo-vac companion apps we'ved used, so even if you're gifting the s9+ to a loved on who is a novice, they should have no trouble getting the thing set up and using it regularly. If you're willing to splurge this holiday season, the s9+ is one of the best robo-vacs you can get for your money.</p><p><em>Get the latest </em><a href="https://engadget.com/black-friday/"><em>Black Friday</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyber-monday/"><em>Cyber Monday</em></a><em> offers by following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribing to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em>.</em></p>

## FCC bans telecom and video surveillance gear from Huawei, ZTE and other Chinese companies

<p>Last year, the Biden administration <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-signs-law-blocking-huawei-and-zte-from-fcc-licenses-081513515.html">signed the Secure Equipment Act into law</a>, which aimed to block the authorization of network licenses from several Chinese companies whose hardware has been deemed a national security threat. Today, the FCC announced that it's <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-bans-authorizations-devices-pose-national-security-threat">officially implementing that ruling</a>, which means some future equipment from Huawei, ZTE, Hytera, Hikvision and Dahua won't be authorized for sale in the US. Existing equipment from those companies, which are all listed under the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/supplychain/coveredlist">FCC's "Covered List,"</a> aren't affected by the law.</p><p>“The FCC is committed to protecting our national security by ensuring that untrustworthy communications equipment is not authorized for use within our borders, and we are continuing that work here,” FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement. “These new rules are an important part of our ongoing actions to protect the American people from national security threats involving telecommunications.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To be clear, the FCC isn't completely blocking <em>all </em>hardware from these companies. And for some, like Hytera, Hikvision and Dahua, <a>Rosenworcel writes</a> that it's specifically focusing on gear related to "the purpose of public safety, security of government facilities, physical surveillance of critical infrastructure, and other national security purposes." If those companies can show that they're not marketing that equipment for government use — for example, directing it consumers instead — they may be able get authorized by the FCC.</p><p>This latest move follows years of conflict between the US and companies closely tied to Chinese governments. That's included placing several notable Chinese companies, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-government-china-dji-investment-blocklist-103514525.html">including DJI</a>, on the Department of Commerce's "Entity List," which prohibits US firms from selling equipment to them.
