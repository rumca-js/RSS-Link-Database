It was a busy shopping day stores opened normal time for. And while you would see videos of people wildin' out on the evening news (that's how we got content in the olden days), real ones knew the worst day was the Saturday before Christmas. </p><p>But we live in modern times where customers have become savage. Others come out just for the Black Friday \"experience.\" I guess hype videos like this Best Buy manager rallying the troops are necessary.</p><p>It's from a few years ago (shout out to <a href=\"https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2022/11/25/best-buy-manager-does-his-best-stone-cold-steve-austin-for-black-friday-pump-up-speech/\" target=\"_blank\">Whiskey Riff</a>), but I'm a sucker for a good pro rasslin' reference. \"Stone Cold\" Steve Manager, take it away.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">This is how you rally the troops before the hordes of Black Friday shopping lunatics breach the front door\u2026 <a href=\"https://t.co/6Bm0eovo6E\">pic.twitter.com/6Bm0eovo6E</a><br />\u2014 Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1596515259871006720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 26, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>That's one way to rally the troops.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"47432\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32213610&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>I said that's one way to rally the troops.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"272a4\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32213611&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>The troops.

Out of all the \"social media alternatives,\" it was the one that rivaled Facebook in driving traffic to websites.
