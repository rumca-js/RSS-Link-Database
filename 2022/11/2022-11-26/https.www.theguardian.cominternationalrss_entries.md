<p>This might just be his World Cup after all. Lionel Messi must battle football opponents and the sands of time in equal measure this month but here he dismissed both with a flourish that, whatever happens to him and Argentina from here, will be treasured by those privileged to bear witness. His side were a slip away from oblivion on an intense, pressured and niggly night where potential ramifications seemed to stifle everyone in view. Messi was firmly among that number until breaching a limited Mexico with a thrilling goal that guarantees him at least one more dance on this stage and has the potential to change the course of this tournament.</p><p>Messi’s left-footed finish was outdone aesthetically by a sumptuous late curler from Enzo Fernández but his 64th minute opener was for the ages nonetheless. It was out of keeping with an occasion on which little had come off. There had been sighs when he sent a wayward pass over the left touchline but then, after Ángel Di María had clipped a deliberate ball across from the opposite side, the tenor shifted emphatically.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/26/argentina-mexico-world-cup-group-c-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Having found it, and set it up to join the upgraded wifi network that hadn’t existed when I first got it, I asked it a question: “Alexa, why are you such a loss-maker?” To which she calmly replied: “This might answer your question: mustard gas, also known as Lost, is manufactured by the United States.” At which point, I solemnly thanked her, pulled the power cable and returned her to the drawer, where she will continue to gather dust until I can think of an ecologically responsible way of recycling her.</p><p>I bought the device on 5 December 2016 (on the basis that one shouldn’t pontificate on kit that one hasn’t purchased oneself) and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/15/amazon-echo-is-great-but-what-does-it-hear">wrote about it in January 2017</a>.

<p>(Glitterbeat)<br />The singer reflects on past loves, current politics and her once glorious Istanbul on this eclectic fourth album spanning folk to psych-rock</p><p>Pop counter-culture comes in many guises. In the case of Istanbul singer <a href="https://www.gayesuakyol.com/">Gaye Su Akyol</a> it sometimes seems enough that she exists, a glittering, poetic presence amid the repressive atmosphere of today’s Turkey. Now 37, she brings with her an elegant, sonorous voice and a highly eclectic mix of Turkish folk and western rock amid which are sprinkled popular anthems of dissidence – the celebrated Write Journalist Write by the persecuted singer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/oct/15/shopping.folk4">Selda Bağcan</a> is a case in point.</p><p>Her own songs are more oblique and personal. Those on <a href="https://idol-io.link/AnadoluEjderi">this fourth album</a> are mostly love calls, often laced with fanciful imagery – “I’m an Olympic swimmer in a razorblade pool”<em> –</em> though when she laments <em>“</em>I’m in love with you forever<em>”</em> on Kör Biçaklarin Ucunda, it’s her home city she’s addressing. Istanbul, its former glories or current decay, is always close. The musical hybrid is as wild as ever. Anatolian folk tunes remain a well spring, and there are traditional instruments in the mix, but it’s largely a blend of rowdy psych-rock (Kurt Cobain is among her heroes) and Turkish pop. It’s all precision played, led by her long-time guitarist Ali Güçlü Şimşek, who fuses surf guitar with Middle-Eastern flavours. As its title translates, an Anatolian dragon. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/26/gaye-su-akyol-anadolu-ejderi-review-poetic-turkish-dissident-pop">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The ‘ethics stuff’ was just a front, says the bankrupted cryptocurrency billionaire Sam Bankmann-Fried</p><p>I remember reading <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/20/doing-good-better-william-macaskill-review">William MacAskill’s book</a> <em>Doing Good Better</em> back in 2015 and wondering: is this too good to be true? MacAskill, the fresh-faced Oxford philosopher and prime mover of “effective altruism”, was on a mission to take personal emotion out of charitable giving. Doing good works was one thing, he suggested, but if you really wanted to scale charitable effect it was the duty of social justice warriors in the affluent west to earn as much money as possible, and then give it away in the most evidence-based fashion, to the poorest people on the planet.</p><p>His book was brilliantly argued, and lauded by great philanthropists, including Bill Gates. At its heart though, as with any manifesto that seeks to remake the world, it felt like there was a nagging flaw: could the means of outrageous wealth creation ever be properly separated from greed; was there really any such thing as an altruistic billionaire? One answer has been provided by the continuing examination of the $27bn bankruptcy of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/19/polyamory-penthouses-and-plenty-of-loans-inside-the-crazy-world-of-ftx">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> and his cryptocurrency platform FTX.

MacAskill was on the advisory board of FTX’s charitable Future Fund; he described the 30-year-old billionaire as his “collaborator” when he <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-bankman-fried-guru-texted-elon-musk-helping-buy-twitter-2022-9?r=US&amp;IR=T">contacted</a> another fan, Elon Musk, earlier this year to arrange a meeting to discuss Bankman-Fried investing in Twitter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/26/if-greed-can-ever-be-good-that-philosophy-didnt-work-at-ftxs-charity">Continue reading...</a>

Not that they really require it after seeing off Lionel Messi et al, but you get the general gist.

<p>There’s a quiet revolution happening over how we address people, and behind it lies a surprising history …</p><p>Jamie Forsstreom is excited. Tomorrow they make their debut flight with Virgin Atlantic as part of the cabin crew on a plane to San Francisco. Forsstreom will be wearing a burgundy trouser suit designed by Vivienne Westwood, with their pronouns – “They/them” – on a badge pinned to the lapel. Forsstreom comes from Finland, a country where gendered pronouns don’t exist in the language. “I’ve learned English since I was nine years old, so I’ve always known about them, but in terms of using them to define my own gender identity, I was quite late to the game,” they say. It wasn’t until Forsstreom moved to London six years ago in their mid‑20s, and started to work exclusively in English, that they decided to make the change and honour a non-binary identity that they have been clear about since early childhood.</p><p>In September, Virgin Atlantic became the latest company to throw itself into a quiet revolution sweeping through the institutional world. You could call it the great corporate pronoun push. The airline’s <a href="https://corporate.virginatlantic.com/gb/en/media/press-releases/virgin-atlantic-updates-gender-identity-policy.html" title="">announcement</a> that from now on it would be possible not only for staff, but for customers to travel under the gender of their choice caused little media furore but a big run on their rather elegant pronoun badges. Within a month, the 10,000 they had printed out for distribution on planes and in their travel shops had been snapped up. A second batch is currently on order.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/26/pronouns-gendered-language-revolution-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The novelist and playwright’s memoir is the heartbreaking story of losing his wife, Marilyn Imrie, to MND, but also a wonderful account of their time together</p><p>When James Runcie recalls his late wife Marilyn Imrie, the much-loved drama director, he does so in colour. First there is the extraordinary skin, pale as milk, which he noticed the first time he set eyes on her at a BBC meeting in the early 80s. Later, in the course of their 35-year marriage, he learns to relish her vibrant fashion palette: “She generally wore clothes as boldly as those old Soviet posters in red, black and white, with accents of silver, pink and blue.” He knows – and cares – enough to itemise her favourite pieces: a deep-purple blouse from Issey Miyake, a jacket bought from Biba in the late 60s, an antique Japanese kimono. The impression Runcie paints is of a bird of paradise flashing across the muddy pond of conventional good taste.</p><p>Sound is part of Imrie’s extraordinary call to her broken-hearted widower, too. “I had always thought she had the most beautiful voice in the world,” he recalls, explaining how Imrie had started her career as a folk singer and spent their years together belting out Joni Mitchell or Strauss in the shower. When the neurologist writes in his notes that Imrie is now “unable to sing”, it is clear something terrible has happened. “Instead of Márquez’s Love in the Time of Cholera.” says Runcie grimly, “we were faced with Terminal Illness in the Time of Covid 19.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/26/tell-me-good-things-by-james-runcie-review-love-loss-and-lessons-learned">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Yes, this book adaptation – about a couple who fall in love while timesharing an apartment – has the stupidest series hook of all time. But it’s fun, tight – and great hangover TV</p><p>I used to be quite cynical about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/feb/12/52-perfect-romcoms-for-valentines-day">romcoms</a>. Oh the two leads are going to fall in love, are they? Will they squabble when they first meet, then slowly grow to bring the best out of each other? Perhaps she has two men to choose from and one is the worst man on the face of the planet, yes, but he <em>is </em>sexy in quite a dangerous way? At some point will she fall over and suffer a very minor injury? Will there be a series of avoidable misunderstandings leading to a second-act argument that threatens to derail everything? Finally kissing in the snow? Come on. Give me a break.</p><p>But then I grew up. I’m sorry, but you can’t watch subtitled arthouse Cannes hits when you’re hungover. Sometimes you need something simple and tropey and soft-edged. Because of that – because the romcom is, at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/08/love-is-still-in-the-air-why-the-romcom-has-come-back-from-the-dead">its core</a>, the same story told over and over again – it’s actually quite difficult to get it <em>right</em>. People know what they want, and they have a dozen immaculate examples of the form they can rewatch if your attempt doesn’t give it to them. First, the two actors have to have irresistible, smile-on-your-face-to-watch-it chemistry (you need to <em>want</em> them to fall in love). Second, the machinery that is pushing them together needs to be as stupid and as goofy as possible. Third, at least one of them has to work a lowly job at a magazine. It’s not vital but it is useful if the sexy badboy of the equation has a motorbike. The Flatshare (Thursday, Paramount+) has completely fulfilled this brief.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/26/the-flatshare-this-charming-romcom-is-like-dipping-into-a-nice-warm-bath">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I can’t take up a weapon, so I create’: how Ukraine’s artists are taking on Putin’s Russia

<p>Putin’s invasion was designed to eradicate Ukraine’s sense of identity and history. But the nation’s artists are weaponising their work to mount a powerful act of resistance</p><p>When I meet him, artist <a href="http://www.oleksiysai.com/" title="">Oleksiy Sai</a>, along with his wife and son, have slept the night in their studio, a warren of rooms tucked behind an unassuming courtyard in central Kyiv. It’s on the ground floor, and with good walls, so they reckon it’s reasonably safe from Russian rockets. Safer, that is, than their apartment: the previous day they were woken by the juddering scream-boom of cruise missile strikes, one cratering a children’s playground a block from their flat. Somehow, their windows survived, though the glass was blown out of most of the nearby buildings. Now, the whole family is busy making work: his son Vasyl is at a screen editing videos; his wife, Svitlana Ratoshnyuk, is making folksy textiles embroidered with “Fuck Putin” in Ukrainian.</p><p>Before the war, Sai – slim, intense, wearing a black hoodie – used to make colourful works, based on Excel software, that wryly commented on “office life and global culture”. But when the Russians invaded on 24 February, he says, “I forgot about art completely, I forgot all my plans and started working for the war.” First, he began rolling out designs for protest posters. “I know how to do it fast,” Sai says; he honed the skill nearly a decade ago, during the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/24/ukraine-protesters-yanukovych-aborts-eu-deal-russia" title="">2013 Maidan Square protests</a> against the pro-Russian then president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/viktor-yanukovych" title="">Viktor Yanukovych</a>. Sai’s banner designs have been seen on the streets of London, New York and Berlin. They are not subtle. “<a href="https://www.alamy.com/london-uk-15th-march-2022-a-protester-wearing-a-balaclava-holds-a-unilever-quit-russia!-placard-protesters-gathered-outside-the-unilever-headquarters-at-victoria-embankment-demanding-that-the-company-stops-doing-business-in-russia-as-the-war-in-ukraine-continues-credit-vuk-valcicalamy-live-news-image464614879.html" title="">Unilever!

Perhaps when the end finally comes, when we are lying on our deathbeds preparing to gasp our final breath, we will think back to that night we spent watching John Stones and Harry Maguire mesmerically passing the ball to each other, and quietly mourn the passing of time.</p><p>It was scarcely more enthralling in the flesh than it will have been on television. The Al Bayt stadium rumbled and murmured. A lone drummer in the US end pounded out a menacing rhythm. Stones and Maguire carried on passing the ball to each other, with Luke Shaw and Kieran Trippier occasionally chipping in. There was some more passing. Some more drumming. Empires rose and fell. The seas parted and unparted again.

With only rudimentary cooking implements – a hot rock, some scraps of animal skin, perhaps a favoured prodding stick, plus stones for pounding, cutting, scraping and grinding – their hands must have been a scarred mess, and the woodsmoke from the hearth must have played havoc with their eyes. However, according to research published this week, they did at least have access to a <em>smörgåsbord</em> of ingredients.</p><p>Gone is the stereotype of Neanderthals tearing into raw tubers or gnawing on a leg of roasted animal meat.

## Rich nations have promised to pay for the climate crisis – but will they? |  Gordon Brown

<p>For too long pledges have gone unmet, so at Cop28 new solutions need to be explored</p><p>• Gordon Brown is the WHO ambassador for global health financing</p><p>On Sunday, loud cheers from Sharm el-Sheikh greeted the announcement of a new initiative – the global loss and damage fund – to right historical wrongs by compensating climate-hit developing countries. This breakthrough brought back memories of another, the £100bn a year agreed at the <a href="https://unfccc.int/process/conferences/pastconferences/copenhagen-climate-change-conference-december-2009/statements-and-resources/outcome-of-the-copenhagen-conference">2009 Copenhagen climate summit</a> to help poor countries mitigate the effects of the climate crisis.</p><p>That money has never fully materialised. If our 13 years’ experience of the £100bn fund that never was is anything to go by, eulogies of praise will soon turn into allegations of betrayal. The president of next year’s Cop28 will have to answer for yet another fund without funders. Far from the loss and damage fund narrowing the credibility gap on climate action, it is likely to bridge nothing if money fails to flow from rich to poor.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/26/rich-nations-climate-crisis-cop28-gordon-brown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Manchester City midfielder – currently leading Belgium’s golden generation in their last stab at World Cup glory – is football’s quiet genius. He gives a rare look at the family life of a Premier League superstar</p><p>Confession. I’m a Manchester City fan. Another confession. Kevin De Bruyne is my favourite player. In 30 years of journalism, I’ve never interviewed a City player. Don’t meet your heroes, they say. The whole thing is discombobulating. De Bruyne – one of the world’s great players – has agreed to a rare interview. But there’s a caveat. If you talk to me, he says, you also talk to my wife, my kids, you do it at our home and you get to know us all. Usually, it’s the opposite – you don’t talk to my family, you don’t come to my home, it’s all about the work rather than the private life. Strange.</p><p>We meet a few weeks before the start of the World Cup. He’s beginning to think about it. But in typical De Bruyne fashion he dispenses with diplomacy and tells it as it is. No, he’s not happy about it being in Qatar. Yes, it is a distraction from the Premier League. No, he doesn’t think Belgium have much chance of winning.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/26/kevin-de-bruyne-manchester-city-belgium-world-cup-home-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The involving and affecting romantic thriller is a sterling example of collaboration and how the studio system can often excel</p><p>Many of the greatest films of all time have some triumph-over-adversity story to buffer their mythology: a chaotic production, weak box office, critics that didn’t get it at the time, a loss to some forgettable film during awards season. Their greatness has to be elusive and mysterious, in other words, something that couldn’t be comprehended until later, when they finally got the full appreciation they always deserved. The path to canonization tends to have its own, often formulaic narrative.</p><p>That’s not what happened with Casablanca, which now celebrates 80 years of being widely beloved. Perhaps it wasn’t loved at the level that it is now – it was merely warmly received and successful, but not a sensation – but it won best picture, along with awards for its peerless screenplay and elegant direction, and is the rare film whose “classic” status is practically axiomatic. Who doesn’t love Casablanca?

<p>This spice pouch is a festive and thrifty way to use up tired spices and dried ginger and citrus peel</p><p>I love making edible gifts, mainly because a handmade one feels somehow more generous than something you’ve just bought in a shop; it can also be a thrifty way to clear out your cupboards. This Christmas, I’m making mulled wine pouches using warming spices and saved-up dried ginger and citrus peel, which I’ve dried above the oven. Spices are better bought whole, rather than ground, because they stay fresher that way. Even so, they, too, will lose potency over time, so it’s a good idea to rotate them, making sure older spices get used up before you buy replacements. (At home, we keep a “use-next” box of dried ingredients on the countertop, which often doubles up as inspiration for our next meal.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/nov/26/how-to-make-mulled-wine-spice-pouch-old-peel-spices-recipe-tom-hunt-waste-not-zero-waste-cooking">Continue reading...</a>
