Chinese people, who have experienced nearly three years of strict control, have become weary of fighting the epidemic. In addition to the massive protests that broke out at Foxconn in Henan on Nov. 23rd, there was a massive revolt against the anti-epidemic policy in Guangzhou's Haizhu district in mid-November. 
The World Cup in Qatar, which began in late November, was marked by loud noises and applause on the playfield, in contrast to the "silence" in many mainland Chinese cities. Many Chinese fans watched the games live. They were shocked to see that the players and virtually all spectators wore no masks. This is despite the fact that the CCP media, outside of the live broadcast, tried to blur out the audience as much as possible so that the Chinese audience couldn't see that they weren't wearing masks. But this strange move made the Chinese people speculate even more about the implications.
