<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Most people who are in the market for a new graphics card have one primary question in mind: Which card will give me the most bang for my buck? Obviously, the answer will vary depending on your budget. Beyond that, there are a number of factors to consider:&nbsp;Raw performance is important, but so are things like noise, the driver experience, and supplemental software.&nbsp;And do you want to pay a premium to get in on the bleeding edge of real-time ray tracing?</p>



<p>Let us make it easy for you.&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve tested nearly every major GPU that&rsquo;s hit the streets over the past couple of years, from $100 budget cards to $1,800 luxury models. Our knowledge has been distilled into this article&mdash;a buying guide with recommendations on which graphics card to buy, no matter what sort of experience you&rsquo;re looking for. </p>



<p>And yes, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/792940/why-its-finally-finally-time-to-buy-a-graphics-card.html">you can <em>finally</em> buy a GPU again</a>. After over two years of an insane graphics card crunch spurred by chip shortages and an insane cryptocurrency surge, the dam has finally burst. End result? GPU prices are finally plummeting across the board, with higher-end graphics cards seeing especially steep sales. While you <em>can </em><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/826475/6-things-consider-buying-used-graphics-card.html">buy a used GPU</a> for less cash, picking up a new model with a full warranty and no risk is a lot more enticing with prices finally approaching sanity. </p>



<p>We&rsquo;re also just starting to see a new breed of graphics cards arrive. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s ferocious GeForce RTX 4090 is here</a>, unlocking new 4K high-refresh gaming experiences like we&rsquo;ve never seen before&mdash;but <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1370609/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-5-crucial-details-pc-gamers-need-to-know.html">AMD&rsquo;s rival &ldquo;RDNA 3&rdquo; graphics cards</a> are right around the corner, too, with lower prices and a radical new GPU design in tow. And <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341464/intel-arc-a770-a750-graphics-card-xe-hpg-review.html">Intel&rsquo;s debut Arc A7 graphics cards</a> <em>finally</em> arrived this fall as well, albeit with plenty of rough edges obfuscating some of its enticing promise. But if you need a new graphics card <em>today</em>, here are your best options. Street pricing for these cards still fluctuates wildly, and these rankings take real-world costs into account&mdash;which currently give AMD&rsquo;s Radeon GPUs an edge.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Note:</strong> There are customized versions of every graphics card from a host of vendors. For example, you can buy different GeForce GTX 3080 models from EVGA, Asus, MSI, and Zotac, among others.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve linked to our complete review for each recommendation, but the buying links lead to models that hew closely to each graphics card&rsquo;s MSRP. Spending extra can get you hefty out-of-the-box overclocks, beefier cooling systems, and more. Check out our &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/feed#wtlfcc" rel="nofollow">What to look for in a custom card</a>&rdquo; section below for tips on how to choose a customized card that&rsquo;s right for you.</p></blockquote>

<p>Prices may be relaxing, but currently, the much-maligned Radeon RX 6500 XT is still the only semi-reasonable sub-$250 option around. If you can find it for a good price, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/608294/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3050-review.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce RTX 3050</a> is a much more capable modern graphics card, but its pricing is typically inflated at around $300. The Radeon RX 6500 XT is less appealing thanks to its nerfed memory, PCIe lanes, and limited ports, not to mention lower performance, but you can often find them going for around $200 on the streets these days. Those hardware limitations mean you&rsquo;ll need to stick to Medium or High graphics settings at 1080p resolution in modern games in order to achieve playable frame rates, but if you do that, you&rsquo;ll enjoy the experience.</p>

<p>AMD&rsquo;s Radeon RX 6600 and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394228/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s rival GeForce RTX 3060</a> both ostensibly carry the same $329 MSRP, but on the streets, there&rsquo;s a much wider gap. You can find the 6600 going for prices starting around $300, while the cheapest RTX 3060 begins at $400. Those are both steep entry costs for 1080p gaming&mdash;at least compared to the GPUs of yesteryear&mdash;but with 8GB of fast GDDR6 memory, insanely good power efficiency, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/623910/amd-adrenalin-radeon-super-resolution-is-here-to-speed-up-your-games.html">AMD&rsquo;s Radeon Super Resolution</a> in tow, the Radeon RX 6600 is a great graphics card for people looking to game at 1080p resolution at 60fps or higher without compromising on visual fidelity.

<p>Nvidia is on its second-generation of dedicated ray tracing hardware, and its killer DLSS upsampling feature is in hundreds of games to claw back the performance lost to turning on ray tracing (which carries a steep performance penalty). At $330-plus, it ain&rsquo;t cheap, but if enabling those cutting-edge lighting effects is a priority, you&rsquo;ll want to go with GeForce. The RTX 3060 is another solid option, but it&rsquo;s $400 on the streets and delivers performance on par with the $300 Radeon RX 6600 in games that don&rsquo;t use ray tracing.</p>

<p>If you mostly play newer games running on DirectX 12 or Vulkan APIs, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341464/intel-arc-a770-a750-graphics-card-xe-hpg-review.html">Intel&rsquo;s Arc A770</a> delivers excellent performance there, along with ray tracing chops on par with the RTX 30-series. It struggles with older DirectX 11 titles, however, and this first generation product also comes with a fair share of bugs in its early days.</p>

<p>In a sane world, Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti would dominate 1440p gaming at its $400 MSRP. It&rsquo;s that good, and it offers superior ray tracing performance to AMD&rsquo;s Radeon rivals. But we still aren&rsquo;t living in a sane world, and the RTX 3060 Ti is going for $500+ on the streets, and often $550 to $600. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393649/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-founders-edition-review-vs-2080-ti.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 3070</a>, ostensibly $500, goes for $650 to $700 online. Get AMD&rsquo;s Radeon RX 6700 XT instead. It&rsquo;s plenty fast for 1440p gaming at 60fps+ without compromise, while its beefy 12GB of GDDR6 memory provides plenty of headroom for flipping on all the most intense graphical features. The one downside? AMD&rsquo;s card is only capable of playing ray-traced games at 1080p resolution unless you activate Radeon Super Resolution, or FSR 1 or 2 in games that support it. One the flip side, the Radeon RX 6700 XT can take advantage of AMD&rsquo;s awesome performance-boosting Smart Access Memory feature if you&rsquo;re running a modern Ryzen system that supports it.</p>

<p>Yes, the RTX 3060 Ti remains overpriced compared to its MSRP, going for $500+ rather than the expected $400&mdash;but that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s that good. If you want a killer 1440p gaming experience with top-notch ray tracing as the cherry on top, this is the card to buy even at an inflated price. The step-down <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394228/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review.html">GeForce RTX 3060</a> is also worth considering, though you may need to turn down some graphics settings when you enable ray tracing, while the step-up <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393649/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-founders-edition-review-vs-2080-ti.html">RTX 3070</a> doesn&rsquo;t deliver enough of a performance boost to justify spending yet more.</p>

<p>Graphics cards that cost $1,000 didn&rsquo;t used to exist, but now they&rsquo;re commonplace. All of them offer a compelling 4K gaming experience. But if you want peak performance no matter the price, you&rsquo;ll be spectacularly pleased with the GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition. This is the first graphics card capable of maxing out a 120Hz 4K monitor in many modern games&mdash;a monumental achievement. The GeForce RTX 4090 embarrasses all previous GPU contenders in all games, full stop&mdash;it&rsquo;s so fast that games can become <em>CPU </em>bottlenecked even at 4K/Ultra when using this GPU. You&rsquo;ll want a new Radeon 9 7950X or Intel Core i9-13900K to truly take advantage of it. </p>

<p>Beyond the raw speed, the RTX 4090 also offers an ample 24GB of GDDR6 memory for content creators, best-in-class ray tracing chops, and new DLSS 3 technology that uses AI to improve frame rates <em>substantially</em>&mdash;think twofold or even more, though responsiveness can take a hit in some games. It remains to be seen if <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1370609/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-5-crucial-details-pc-gamers-need-to-know.html">AMD&rsquo;s $999 Radeon RX 7900 XTX</a> will be able to dethrone Nvidia&rsquo;s new champion, but either way, the RTX 4090 is an absolutely sublime GPU for peak-performance gaming.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a 4K/60Hz monitor and want to put all those pixels to work, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393649/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-founders-edition-review-vs-2080-ti.html">RTX 3070</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394671/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-ti-review.html">3070 Ti</a> and AMD&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/699131/sapphire-nitro-amd-radeon-rx-6650-xt-6750-xt-6950-xt-pure-review.html">Radeon RX 6750 XT</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393729/amd-radeon-rx-6800-rx-6800-xt-review.html">RX 6800</a> are all decent cheaper options. But if you want the best possible experience without any visual compromises, spend $800 and pick up the 10GB version of the RTX 3080. (The $1,000 12GB model isn&rsquo;t worth the upcharge despite being slightly more future-proof.) The GeForce RTX 3080 packs enough power to blow through games even at 4K resolution with eye candy cranked, including ray traced games thanks to Nvidia&rsquo;s killer combo of second-gen ray tracing hardware and DLSS.</p>

<p>The one problem? This is an insanely popular GPU, and it can still be difficult to find models around the 3080&rsquo;s $800 MSRP (though they&rsquo;re definitely popping up). AMD&rsquo;s rival Radeon RX 6800 XT is easier to find, just as fast, and packs a whopping 16GB of GDDR6 memory, but Nvidia&rsquo;s superior ray tracing and DLSS chops earn it the nod for this price point if you&rsquo;re able to find one around MSRP.</p>

<p>All that said, new GPU generations from both Nvidia and AMD are landing in the closing months of 2022, so you may want to see what the RTX 4080 and Radeon RX 7900 XT bring to the table before splurging on a last-gen flagship. But if you see an RTX 3080 on a hot deal, don&rsquo;t hesitate to pick it up. </p>

<h2 id="how-we-test-graphics-cards">How we test graphics cards</h2>



<p>We test graphics cards on a dedicated test system used only for this purpose, with minimal extra software involved. That ensures that any performance changes we see are generated solely by the graphics card being tested and new GPU drivers, without the variability of other hardware or software changes. Here is the configuration of our current testbed:</p>



<ul><li>AMD Ryzen 5900X, stock settings</li><li>AMD Wraith Max cooler</li><li>MSI Godlike X570 motherboard</li><li>32GB G.Skill Trident Z Neo DDR4 3800 memory</li><li>EVGA 1200W SuperNova P2 power supply </li><li>2x 1TB SK Hynix Gold S31 SSD</li></ul><p>As far as games go, we use a fixed set of games to test every graphics card that comes out in a given generation, and update the suite when a new generation of GPUs is introduced. We test a variety of games spanning most major game types (tactics, racing, FPS, etc.), engines (Unreal Engine, Unity, Anvil, etc.) and underlying graphics APIs (DirectX 11, DX12, Vulkan). We use the built-in benchmarks for each game, but only after validating the accuracy of the results by running the benchmarks and comparing the results to performance witnessed by third-party GPU measurement tools like OCAT. Each game is tested at least three times per resolution, generating an average from those runs, with additional tests run if we encounter any hiccups. We may also perform additional testing with tools like OCAT if any performance oddities are noticed. Power draw is measured on a whole-system basis, listing both idle and fully stressed states as measured via a Watts Up meter that the system is plugged into.</p>



<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-custom-graphics-card">What to look for in a custom graphics card</h2>



<p>If you want to shop beyond the scope of our picks, know that finding the right graphics card can be tricky. Various vendors offer customized versions of every GPU. For example, you can buy different Radeon RX 6700 XT models from Sapphire, XFX, Asus, MSI, and PowerColor.</p>



<p>To help narrow down the options and find the right card for you, you should consider the following things when doing your research:</p>



<p><strong>Overclocks:</strong> Higher-priced custom models are often overclocked out-of-the-box to varying degrees, which can lead to higher performance. Most modern custom cards offer the same essential level of performance,however.</p>



<p><strong>Cooling solutions:&nbsp;</strong>Many graphics cards are available with custom coolers that lower temperatures and fan noise. The vast majority perform well. Liquid-cooled graphics cards run even cooler, but require extra room inside your case for the tubing and radiator. Avoid graphics cards with single-fan, blower-style cooling systems if you can help it, unless you have a small-form-factor PC or plan on using custom water-cooling blocks.</p>



<p><strong>Size:</strong> Many graphics cards are of a similar size, but longer and shorter models of many GPUs exist. High-end graphics cards are starting to sport especially massive custom cooling solutions to tame their enthusiast-class GPUs. Double-check that your chosen graphics card will fit in your case before you buy.</p>



<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Not all hardware supports a wide range of connectivity options. Higher-end graphics cards may lack DVI ports, while lower-end monitors may lack DisplayPorts. Only the most modern Radeon and GeForce graphics cards support HDMI 2.1 outputs. Ensure your graphics card and monitor can connect to each other. Likewise, make sure your power supply meets the recommended wattage for the graphics card you choose.</p>



<p><strong>Real-time ray tracing, FSR, and DLSS: </strong>AMD&rsquo;s Radeon RX 6000-series graphics cards and all of Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX offerings can play games with real-time ray tracing effects active. Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 30-series GPUs hold a massive advantage over everything else though, propelled even further by dedicated tensor cores for processing machine learning tasks such as Deep Learning Super Sampling, which uses AI to speed up the performance of your games with minimal hit to visual fidelity. GeForce RTX 20-series GPUs also support DLSS, while AMD&rsquo;s rival FSR 2.0 and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/623910/amd-adrenalin-radeon-super-resolution-is-here-to-speed-up-your-games.html">Radeon Super Resolution</a> technologies are gaining traction by the day.</p>

<p>Logitech&rsquo;s G502 mouse has gained a legendary status here at PCWorld by making our &lsquo;Best of&rsquo; list every year for the last four years, hitting the right notes for power, comfort, and durability. Under the hood the G502 is powered by a very accurate Logitech Hero sensor, whose precise performance is highly sought after by serious gamers. </p>

<p>In the design department, it offers up dollops of comfort with an elongated pill-shaped body and high scoop that&rsquo;s equally suitable for palm, claw, or fingertip users. MMO and MOBA gamers are well catered to with 11 well-placed buttons that respond quickly and are rated for up to 50 million clicks. Admittedly, the mouse&rsquo;s 121 gram weight doesn&rsquo;t make it the lightest option available, but yet it feels and performs just as well as lighter alternatives. </p>

<p>The Mad Catz R.A.T 8+ is about as customizable as gaming mice come, featuring a modular design that allows you to change up its component parts exactly as you wish to find your ideal mouse shape and weight. Doing so requires you to pull discrete levers and turn knobs integrated into the mouse&rsquo;s body, so there&rsquo;s a fairly steep learning curve before you know what you&rsquo;re doing. </p>

<p>Still, if you love tinkering, this mouse will keep you entertained for hours at a time. It also doesn&rsquo;t skimp in the button department, providing 10 buttons all told, orientated in some pretty original positions for extra convenience. With a stripped-back, bare-bones look, the Mad Catz R.A.T 8+ also stands out in the crowd, making it an obvious talking point at any group gaming sessions. </p>

<p>The more buttons, the heavier and slower gaming mice tend to be, but the SteelSereis Aerox 9 bucks this trend with a whopping 18 buttons and weighing just 89 grams. Needless to say, having 18 buttons at your disposal rather than 6, 8 or 12, gives you a little more firepower to launch commands and macros in games where quick deployment is needed&mdash;especially in MMOs and MOBAs like <em>The</em> <em>Elder Scrolls Online or Final Fantasy XIV</em>.</p>

<p>On top of the generous button selection, the Aerox 9 features a quick 18,000 DPI sensor and dual 2.4GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, so it&rsquo;s highly versatile and portable. Design-wise, the Aerox 9 looks and feels fantastic thanks to a futuristic honeycomb-shaped back with RGB lighting. Additionally, since it weighs under 100 grams, it&rsquo;s fast enough to keep you competitive in first-person shooters.</p>

<p>The Basilisk V3 resembles the Razer Basilisk V2 in size and shape, sporting similar right-handed curves and a slightly arched thumb rest. Among its best features are an 11 button layout, 26,000 DPI Razer Focus+ sensor, and second-generation Razer optical switches that are fast enough for all kinds of gaming&mdash;whether that&rsquo;s casual or serious. But the real magic lies in the Basilisk V3&rsquo;s HyperScroll Tilt Wheel, which is a fancy name for its mouse wheel. This tilts in four directions and triggers downwards to put five commands at your fingertips, ideal for tactical FPS games like <em>Rainbow Six</em>.</p>

<p>Impressively, the HyperScroll Tilt Wheel also has extra AI scrolling modes that make your scrolling and browsing a lot easier. In our testing we enjoyed toggling between &ldquo;Tactile&rdquo; and &ldquo;Free-Spin&rdquo; modes, which allowed us to switch between a slow, precise scrolling action and a faster, smoother scrolling action that was useful for getting to the end of long websites more easily. </p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re merely a good gamer HyperX&rsquo;s Pulsefire Haste Wireless is the kind of mouse that can elevate you to the status of excellence. Weighing just 61 grams, it&rsquo;s the lightest and quickest mouse I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of gaming with, feeling barely-there in my hands. </p>

<p>Just looking at the specifications, you&rsquo;d be mistaken for thinking its PAW3355 16,000 DPI sensor is a little underpowered&mdash;it&rsquo;s not, proving incredibly accurate in shooters like <em>Overwatch</em> and <em>CounterStrike: Global Offensive</em>, especially with the DPI profile set to the lowest setting. Other things that make this mouse a class act include its quick 2.4GHz wireless connectivity, futuristic and comfortable honeycomb-shaped back, and the extra grips and PTFE glide skates that come supplied in the box. </p>

<p>The MM830 differentiates itself from other budget gaming mice with fun features like a built-in D-pad and tiny OLED display that you can set up to show information like your RAM, CPU, and GPU usage stats. But looking beyond these novelties, it also performs well in games, which is infinitely more important. Powering that performance is a top-end 24,000 DPI PMW3360 sensor, which for comparison&rsquo;s sake, is the same as the premium Logitech Hero sensor just with a higher power draw. </p>

<p>On top of the mouse&rsquo;s body the MM830&rsquo;s sports a textured plastic exterior that provides plenty of grip for your hand. A gentle right-hand scoop also makes it incredibly comfy to use even for long gaming stints.   </p>

<p>Few devices offer as much bang for buck as this wired RGB gaming mouse that combines comfort, style and decent performance but without a hefty price tag. The Logitech G203 resembles more expensive esports mice with its simple 6-button configuration, small body and ambidextrous shape, but despite being substantially cheaper than rivals, it still feels sturdy and well-built. The G203&rsquo;s 8,000 DPI sensor isn&rsquo;t the quickest you&rsquo;ll find, but for causal gamers it&rsquo;s still a more than adequate performer that tracks accurately.   </p>

<p>The G203 isn&rsquo;t lacking style either. It features a signature rounded back design with colorful RGB band and Logitech logo that lights up your gaming den with pops of color. The RGB band is also customizable in the Logitech G Hub app, with the option to personalize three separate lighting zones. </p>

<p>There are ordinary RGB gaming mice and then there&rsquo;s the wired ROCCAT Kone XP whose dazzling RGB lighting is something else. More precisely, it features eight internal lighting &ldquo;pipelines&rdquo; powered by 22 individual LEDs that diffuse light throughout the mouse&rsquo;s transparent plastic top. That much RGB is a bold statement that you&rsquo;re either going to love or hate. But either way, it&rsquo;s hard to deny the Kone XP points for originality.  </p>

<p>Despite its flashiness, the ROCCAT Kone XP is also a very capable performer in games. It sports a 15-button layout&mdash;programmable to 29 functions&mdash;that makes it ideal for MMO, RPG, and RTS gaming, where you can rarely have enough options for commands. What&rsquo;s more, a 19,000 DPI Owl-Eye optical sensor and quick optical switches ensure the Kone XP is suitably fast and responsive when you need to fire off commands quickly and accurately.</p>

<p>The Razer DeathAdder V2 X Hyperspeed combines features for gaming as well as productivity, making it ideal for both. In the boardroom it syncs stealthily with its surroundings thanks to an all-black design with no RGB lighting zones. But beneath its modest exterior it hides a highly sensitive 14,000 DPI sensor, which is a solid performer in AAA games.</p>

<p>Dual 2.4GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity lets you switch between your gaming PC and work laptop just by flicking a switch underneath the mouse&rsquo;s body. Unlike some gaming mice, the Razer DeathAdder V2 X Hyperspeed is powered by either an AA or AAA battery, making it ultraportable. It can stay powered a whopping 235 hours in Wi-Fi mode and 615 hours in Bluetooth mode just on a single AA battery. </p>

<p>Two features stand out to make the SteelSeries Rival 650 a top choice for gamers. The first is a dual sensor system comprised of a TrueMove 3 sensor and a dedicated depth sensor. The depth sensor allows the Rival 650 to detect lift-off at a distance as small as half a millimeter, which is double the sensitivity of rival gaming mice. Needless to say, if you&rsquo;re prone to lifting, the Rival 650 should help steady your aim.</p>

<p>The second feature highlighted by our PCWorld reviewer is its fast-charging capability that gets you back gaming sooner when the battery runs out. SteelSeries claims just 15 minutes charging time is enough to power the mouse for 10 (or more) hours of battery. On top of these two useful innovations the Rival 650 sports an elegant design that lets you peel of the left and right side panels and adjust it to your preferred weight.  </p>

<h2 id="how-we-test-gaming-mice">How we test gaming mice</h2>



<p>To ensure that our gaming mice selections are the pick of the crop, the PCWorld team subjects them to extensive play testing as well as a legion of other tests. We scrutinize everything from how well a mouse perform in games, to the size and shape of it in the hand, to comfort and ergonomics, to customizations. Here are the main categories our tests fall under:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Gaming performance:</strong> At the end of the day it doesn&rsquo;t matter how a mouse looks; it&rsquo;s how it performs that matters. To evaluate a mouse&rsquo;s performance we look specifically at how sensitive and responsive its sensor is and also how well the sensor tracks movement. Precision is also a key consideration, with mice that are more accurate generally scoring better in our reviews than those that aren&rsquo;t. In wireless mice we also evaluate the speed and strength of the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals, keeping a look out for red flags like signal dropouts or interference. Some mice also come with software enhancements that determine the mouse&rsquo;s lift-off distance, which we also examine in our testing.    </li><li><strong>Design and ergonomics:</strong> You won&rsquo;t find another tech device for which design plays a more crucial part of a user&rsquo;s experience. And, while it&rsquo;s true that there&rsquo;s no one shape, size, or configuration that fits every gamer, there&rsquo;s enough variation out there for every gamer to find their own perfect fit. When looking at design, we consider the size and shape of the device itself and the type of hand it fits. Gamers tend to use one of three common grip types&mdash;palm, claw, or fingertip&mdash;so a mouse&rsquo;s compatibility with one or all of those types is a big consideration. </li><li><strong>Software: </strong>Being able to tweak settings like your mouse&rsquo;s DPI and polling rate and create specific profiles for your favorite games can make or break your gaming experience, which is why a mouse&rsquo;s software support is so important. Our PCWorld reviewers&rsquo; focus here is to consider the range and scope of software support and how readily settings can be modified, changed, and saved for future use.  </li></ul><h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-gaming-mouse">What to look for in a gaming mouse</h2>



<h3 id="connectivity-wired-versus-wireless">Connectivity: Wired versus wireless?</h3>



<p>It used to be generally well accepted that wired gaming mice had the edge over their wireless counterparts, providing gamers with a much faster and more accurate signal between mice and PCs. However, that&rsquo;s less true than it used to be thanks to the popularity of 2.4GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wireless technologies, which have almost levelled the playing field. </p>



<p>I say almost, because there&rsquo;s no denying that wired gaming mice still deliver the fastest and most secure connections you can get. That said, whether or not you choose one type over the other should come down to your gaming priorities. </p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re a serious competitive gamer or esports player, where winning or losing sits on a knife&rsquo;s edge, opting for a wired mouse over a wireless one is a good decision, since it&rsquo;s less likely a signal dropout or interference will disrupt your play. Every competitive edge counts. However, wireless mice are infinitely more portable and allow you to switch between devices at a whim, so if nimbleness and portability is more important, a wireless mouse will be a better fit. </p>

<p>Hands, just like gaming mice, come in all different shapes and sizes and for comfort reasons it pays to match like with like. While categorizing sizes of hands can be highly subjective, chances are you&rsquo;ll be able to guess whether your hand is on average small, medium, or large. You can then find a mouse that best fits from among the size categories below: </p>



<ul><li><strong>Small gaming mouse: </strong>Length: Less than 6.7 inches; width: 2.9 to 3.3 inches </li><li><strong>Medium gaming mouse: </strong> Length: 6.7 to 7.9 inches; width: 3.3 to 3.9 inches</li><li><strong>Large gaming mouse: </strong>Length: 7.9 inches; width: 3.9 to 4.3 inches</li></ul><p>Gaming mice generally come in three shapes: left-handed, right-handed, and ambidextrous. Ambidextrous mice are designed to be neutral in that they can be just as easily used by your left or right hand. Alternatively, left-handed and right-handed mice are tailor-made for the dominant hands specified by their namesakes, often sporting bespoke curves and button placements for one or the other. Unless you switch between hands, using a gaming mouse that matches your dominant hand will go a long way to improving your performance and comfort. </p>



<p>Your preferred grip type should also be considered when selecting a suitably shaped mouse. Here&rsquo;s a rough guide for matching grip types with mouse shapes: </p>



<ul><li><strong>Palm grip:</strong> Long, flat mice tend to be a better fit and more comfortable</li><li><strong>Claw grip: </strong>Narrower and smaller mice tend to suit this grip style </li><li><strong>Fingertip grip</strong>: Lighter mice are often preferred by fingertip grippers to reduce strain </li></ul><h3 id="how-light-should-my-mouse-be">How light should my mouse be?</h3>



<p>Gaming mice weights have been gradually trending downwards over the years as players look for lighter options that are quicker to move and prevent arms and wrists getting overly tired or sore in long play sessions. FPS (first-person shooter) gamers in particular tend to go for the lightest mice possible, seeing every millisecond of speed advantage as worth chasing.  </p>



<p>Despite this, there&rsquo;s no ideal gaming mouse weight for all gamers, but rather a deeply personal preference. In fact, some gamers&mdash;often those with larger hands or stronger arms&mdash;actually prefer heavier mice for the extra stability they get. Still if you are one of those looking for the lightest mouse possible, anything under 100 grams will be among the lightest on the market.   </p>



<h3 id="does-dpi-really-matter">Does DPI really matter?</h3>



<p>Your mouse&rsquo;s sensor is the essential hardware component that relays movement to your PC. Mice sensors are rated for DPI, or dots per inch, which tells us how far a cursor moves per inch of mouse movement&mdash;that is, how sensitive it is. Manufacturers really hype up the importance of high DPIs, which can be a bit misleading because they don&rsquo;t necessarily equate to better gaming performance (they can, but not in all circumstances). </p>



<p>For example, if you play a lot of FPS and want the absolute best accuracy while targeting opponents, a lower DPI (between 800-1,000) is preferable, since this allows you to make short, sharp, and precise movements more easily. However, if you make a lot of wide, sweeping hand movements, or if your display is a very high resolution, a mouse with a high DPI (between 12,000-30,000 DPI) can be an advantage.</p>



<p>The great thing about most modern gaming mice is that they can switch between DPI profiles just by clicking a small button behind the mouse wheel. That said, our advice is to opt for a gaming mouse with the highest DPI your budget allows, and then choose your preferred setting for different gaming scenarios by using this handy DPI-switching feature. </p>



<h3 id="is-an-optical-or-laser-sensor-better">Is an optical or laser sensor better?</h3>



<p>Optical sensors are the most popular with gamers since they tend to have less jitter and smoothing problems. These sensors work by casting down infrared or LED light onto your mousepad and capturing thousands of digital images per second, that then reveals the precise location of the mouse to the PC.</p>



<p>On the other hand, laser sensors use a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser diode to determine positioning. In most cases an optical sensor will do just fine. However, if you plan on using your mouse on a translucent surface (like glass), a laser sensor is preferable since it will have better sensitivity to a variety of surface textures. </p>



<h3 id="button-count-how-many-do-i-need">Button count: How many do I need?</h3>



<p>The type of games you play should help you determine how many buttons you need. For example, if you&rsquo;re a big fan of real time strategy (RTS), role-playing games (RPG), or massively multiplayer online (MMOs) games, you&rsquo;d be we&rsquo;ll advised to choose a mouse with between 10 and18 buttons&mdash;like the Razer Naga Pro or the SteelSeries Aerox 9. These games typically require you to fire off a lot of commands quickly, so the more buttons you have to program commands and macros in, the better. </p>



<p>On the flipside, if FPS is your go-to game type, you&rsquo;ll probably want to keep your button count to between 6 and 8 buttons. Chances are you won&rsquo;t need the higher button-count for your smaller list of commands. Plus, buttons tend to increase a mouse&rsquo;s weight, so opting for a mouse with fewer will most likely mean it&rsquo;s lighter and quicker to move in the frantic FPS action.  </p>



<h3 id="rgb-lighting-or-no">RGB lighting or no?</h3>



<p>RGB lighting is a fun feature to have in any gaming device that can brighten up your gaming den with pops of color. It can also be pretty useful, allowing you to see your device better in dimly lit rooms or at night. And yet, there may be times when you opt to use a mouse that has only a minimal RGB, or none at all. </p>



<p>The most common example is if you plan on using your gaming mouse covertly at work. In this case, mice like the Razer DeathAdder V2 X Hyperspeed, that have no RGB lighting zones and can convincingly pass as standard black office mice, are ideal because your colleagues will be none the wiser.  </p>

## Samsung’s insane ‘8K’ ultrawide monitor can a blistering 900Hz, with a catch

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Samsung has been building super-wide gaming monitors for a while now, but its latest one is the most bombastic yet. The newest 49-inch Odyssey monitor has an &ldquo;8K&rdquo; resolution, according to its reveal in the AMD Radeon 7000 presentation, though it&rsquo;s only on the horizontal axis. Assuming the same 32:9 aspect ratio as the current model of the Odyssey Neo G9, that would give it a resolution of 7680&times;2160, essentially two 4K monitors side by side (and the bottom half of a full proper 8K display). But what&rsquo;s really amazing is how fast the display can push those pixels. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/displayport-2-1-8k-high-refresh/&amp;xcust=2-1-1371206-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a>, Samsung claims that the monitor can handle up to 900Hz refresh rate, the maximum output of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1370428/amd-rdna-3-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-reveal.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the new Radeon RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX</a> using DisplayPort 2.1. Now here&rsquo;s the other foot dropping: it can&rsquo;t hit that ridiculous speed at its maximum half-8K resolution. 900Hz is how fast it goes at 1440p resolution, 480Hz at 4K resolution (presumably 3840&times;1080 on the ultrawide panel), and &ldquo;just&rdquo; 165Hz in its native res. Even so, we&rsquo;re talking about approximately 16.6 megapixels, 165 times a second &mdash; still pretty amazing, and better than anything you&rsquo;re likely to find on the market today. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Odyssey G9" class="wp-image-1371253" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/S49AG950NM_008_L-Dynamic_White.webp?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The current Odyssey Neo G9, with &ldquo;only&rdquo; 5120&times;1440 resolution.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Samsung</p></div>



<p>You&rsquo;ll need a new Radeon card to hit those ridiculous refresh rates at that resolution, as even Nvidia&rsquo;s most powerful cards still top out at DisplayPort 1.4. But its other charms, including a quantum dot mini-LED panel, 100R curve rating, and rear RGB lighting, will work with any modern desktop or laptop. More technical details along with a price and release date aren&rsquo;t available, though AMD says similar high-res, high-refresh designs are on the way from Dell, LG, Acer, and Asus, starting in &ldquo;early 2023.&rdquo; More info will be revealed at CES in January.  </p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering how much you should be saving up, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096YNP6ZR/&amp;xcust=2-1-1371206-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the current top-of-the-line Odyssey G9</a> ultrawide with 5K horizontal resolution has a retail price of $2300. A little napkin math says that a $3000+ price tag wouldn&rsquo;t be unreasonable.

## How to swap out the Steam Deck’s noisy fan

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>The Steam Deck is rapidly becoming ubiquitous, sort of the original Game Boy for the modern gaming generation. But one of the many differences between now and then is that Valve has been so open about inviting owners to mod and upgrade its hardware. One of the easiest changes you can make is to swap out the noisy, high-RPM cooling fan that comes with the Steam Deck for a quieter version. Adam Patrick Murray guides you through the upgrade process in the latest PCWorld YouTube video. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure><p>Before you start, you&rsquo;ll need a few parts. First and most obviously is the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ifixit.com/products/steam-deck-fan&amp;xcust=2-1-1369318-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">replacement cooling fan kit, sold by iFixit</a>. The kit packs a fan from manufacturer Huaying, which is already installed on some Steam Decks, while others get a near-identical part from Delta that is much noisier and grating. The iFixit kit is $30, which might seem like a lot for an electronic fan about the size of a poker chip. But it comes with one of iFixit&rsquo;s excellent bit drivers, two Philips bits, full metal angled tweezers, and a set of &ldquo;guitar pick&rdquo; opening tools &mdash; everything you need for this process. You might want to grab a few cups or bowls, too, just to keep the different-sized screws from rolling around. </p>



<p>Once you have your tools and parts together, make sure the Steam Deck is completely powered down and lay it on the front. Take out your MicroSD card if you have one installed, then remove the eight screws holding the rear cover on (note that the four outer screws are longer than the inner screws). Then, starting at the shoulder buttons, use your opening tool to gently pry the rear of the plastic body up, following the central seam around the device&rsquo;s edge. </p>



<p>The Steam Deck&rsquo;s cooling fan is front and center on the rear. Gently remove the piece of foil tape covering the hidden screw in the board shield (the big blank piece of metal on the left), then remove the three screws holding it in place and take the shield off. With that finished, you can unplug the Steam Deck&rsquo;s battery from its mainboard. (Adam skips this precautionary step in the video, because he is a <em>naughty boy.</em>) </p>



<p>Using your tweezers, remove the sticker that&rsquo;s holding the fan to the heatsink directly above it. With the sticker gone, you&rsquo;ll be able to see the tiny 4-pin power plug connecting the fan to the mainboard. With your tweezers, carefully grasp the plastic plug connector (not the wires themselves!) and pull upward to disconnect it. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Steam Deck fan replacement" class="wp-image-1369350" height="674" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/steam-deck-fan.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray/IDG</p></div>



<p>With the sticker gone and the fan unplugged, all you need to do to get it out is remove the two screws holding it to the body, sitting right above the &ldquo;panhandle&rdquo; of the battery. (There are spots for two more screws, but you already removed them when you took off the Steam Deck&rsquo;s rear cover.) With the two screws removed, you can pull the fan right out of the body. To install the new fan, simply put it into the resulting hole in the Steam Deck&rsquo;s guts and perform these steps in reverse. </p>



<p>Replace the two screws to affix the fan in place, plug its 4-pin power connector to the mainboard, replace the heatsink sticker, plug the battery back into the mainboard, replace the board shield, screw it down with its three screws, then place the bit of foil back over the central screw. Place the rear plastic body cover back on the Steam Deck and snap it tight to make sure all the seams are in place, then replace all eight of the body screws. You&rsquo;re done! </p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re going from the Delta to the Huaying fan, you should notice a definite drop in noise, especially when the Steam Deck is running a high-end game and really hitting its CPU and GPU hard.

You probably just can&rsquo;t crank the eye candy to 11 in especially strenuous modern games. The 15.6-inch IPS display has a 1920&times;1080 resolution and a 144Hz refresh rate, an excellent loadout for an affordable gaming laptop like this. </p>



<p>This is an awesome deal, especially if you&rsquo;re looking to get your game on without breaking the bank.</p>

## New AMD Advantage Desktops leverage Ryzen and Radeon’s combined might

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>AMD&rsquo;s Advantage series of laptops, built in cooperation with OEM laptop makers like Dell, Lenovo, and Asus, are a hit. Closely integrating Ryzen CPUs and Radeon GPUs under the watchful technical guidance of AMD itself makes some fan-favorite gaming laptop designs, like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/617171/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-2022-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Asus ROG Zephyrus G14</a>. Along with the announcement of the Radeon 7000 GPU series, AMD has decided to expand the program to include desktops as well. AMD Advantage Desktops will be available soon from CSL, CyberpowerPC, eBuyer, Falcon Northwest, Maingear, Origin, and Xidax. </p>



<p>What qualifies a pre-built desktop for that Advantage label? To start with, nothing but the best from AMD&rsquo;s chip offerings, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1074246/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Ryzen 9 7950X CPU</a> and the new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1370428/amd-rdna-3-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-reveal.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Radeon RX 7900 XTX</a> graphics card. On top of that, minimum specs for the other components include 2TB of NVMe storage, 32GB of DDR5 memory, liquid cooling on the CPU (at least), an 80 Plus Gold (or better) power supply, and a desktop case with toolless entry. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Advantage Desktop promo shot" class="wp-image-1371118" height="437" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/amd-advantage-desktop-promo-shot.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>In addition, AMD Advantage Desktops are pre-tuned and tested for ideal operation under high thermal loads. The desktops come loaded with AMD&rsquo;s Adrenalin package of software, which includes the usual driver manager and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394720/faster-gaming-frame-rates-for-free-resizable-bar-explained.html">AMD&rsquo;s Smart Access Memory</a> for faster gaming frame rates, plus an exciting new Smart Access Video feature for intelligently distributing encoding and decoding tasks across the CPU and GPU. The company is hoping to lure in content creators and streamers as well as the usual gamers with a mountain of cash to spend on a pre-built rig. AMD says that these desktops should be able to output to a 4K monitor at up to 480Hz in ideal conditions. </p>



<p>There are still plenty of users who like to mix-and-match Intel/Nvidia parts with AMD parts across the CPU and GPU, and AMD has been trying to push for a more unified approach ever since it purchased ATI way back in 2006. Offering these pre-configured machines, with tangible advantages to the CPU-GPU pairing and features that aren&rsquo;t available without it, might make it easier for AMD to break into the upper tiers of both markets. At the time of writing AMD is sitting at about 10 percent market share for CPUs and 20 percent for graphics cards in desktops, and the Advantage program has already been a success in laptops. </p>



<p>AMD didn&rsquo;t announce specific dates or prices for Advantage Desktops, and its promotional page doesn&rsquo;t list any either. Its press release says they&rsquo;ll be available &ldquo;soon.&rdquo; Perhaps that&rsquo;s just as well. With retail prices for the Ryzen 9 CPU and RX 7900 XTX GPU combining for $1700 on their own, plus a laundry list of other high-end components and a boutique markup, you&rsquo;d better start saving your pennies now. </p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>After years of shortages and product delays, the PC industry slammed on the gas pedal in 2022, unleashing bleeding-edge hardware at a truly frenetic pace.</p>



<p>A wave of long-lasting, heavy-hitting laptops started the year with a bang. Then the battle turned to desktops, where Intel, Nvidia, and AMD rolled out new generations of processors and graphics cards alike, bolstered by delightful advances in SSDs and new monitors that push pixels harder than ever before. And those are just the tip of the iceberg.</p>



<p>We tested some truly impressive hardware this year&mdash;but you&rsquo;ll only find the absolute greatest on this list. And that&rsquo;s not all: Our top picks include the best software available, because what you use all that computing power&nbsp;<em>for&nbsp;</em>is just as vital.</p>



<p>For this list, we asked PCWorld&rsquo;s tech experts to share their favorite picks in their areas of expertise. Without further ado, this is the best PC hardware and software of 2022 and 2023. Yes, we&rsquo;re looking forward to next year, because until even&nbsp;<em>newer&nbsp;</em>products begin launching in 2023, many of the champions on this list will remain very relevant for months to come.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re on the hunt for a truly spectacular ultraportable, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/825567/dell-xps-13-plus-9320-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Dell XPS 13 Plus</a>&nbsp;is the laptop to target. It&rsquo;s featherlight at under three pounds, the 13.4-inch 3456&times;2160 OLED display is a real sight to behold, and the Intel Core i7-1280P CPU delivers leading-edge performance. That&rsquo;s the full package right there. It has enough oomph to whiz through photo editing work as well as day-to-day tasks like browsing the web and checking e-mail. And the hidden haptic trackpad&mdash;a unique design choice that&rsquo;s different from previous iterations&mdash;helps the Dell XPS 13 Plus look truly sophisticated. You really can&rsquo;t go wrong here. <em>&mdash;Ashley Biancuzzo</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1074246/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-review.html">AMD&rsquo;s 16-core Ryzen 9 7950X</a> may have landed the first blow in this new CPU generation, and it&rsquo;s a mighty foe indeed&mdash;but <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357979/intel-core-i9-13900k-review.html">Intel&rsquo;s 24-core Core i9-13900K</a> is better. The last-gen Core i9-12900K already impressed, but Intel managed to cram twice as many efficiency-focused &ldquo;E&rdquo; cores into the new chip, while simultaneously cranking clock speeds to blistering new 5.8GHz levels. As a result, the Core i9-13900K holds the performance crown in gaming and single-threaded performance, while speeding through heavily multi-core tasks at a 40 percent faster clip than before. Hot damn. </p>



<p>Tipping the scales even further in Intel&rsquo;s favor, the Core i9-13900K also enjoys robust software support for its onboard media engine (helpful for content creators!) and somehow costs less than its Ryzen rival. Adding insult to injury, Intel&rsquo;s 13th-gen Core CPUs also support cheaper DDR4 memory when using select motherboards, unlike AMD, which mandates DDR5 with Ryzen 7000. Faster, cheaper, <em>and</em> better software support? The Intel Core i9-13900K is absolutely the best CPU of this new generation. <em>&mdash;Brad Chacos</em></p>

<p>Sure, some <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html">rival PCIe 4.0 SSDs</a> edge out the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1338529/adata-legend-960-1tb-nvme-ssd-review.html">Adata Legend 960</a> in raw benchmark performance&mdash;but only by the slimmest of margins. Yet somehow, Adata managed to price the Legend 960 at substantially less than the bleeding-edge competition, at just $120 for 1TB or $220 for 2TB capacities, while also tossing an optional heat sink in the box and offering a surprisingly substantial warranty and TBW rating. Our reviewer summed it up perfectly: &ldquo;The Adata Legend 960 is a top-performing NVMe SSD at a mid- to lower-tier price. What&rsquo;s not to like about that?&rdquo; <em>&mdash;Brad Chacos</em></p>

With recent feature updates such as Dark Web Monitoring and VPN access, it has made itself the security suite to beat. The price of $105 for a year subscription, while not insignificant, isn&rsquo;t likely to break the bank either.</p>



<p>Norton also includes a ton of extras in its antivirus suite including file cleanup, startup manager, and options for gamer specific features as well. Last but not least, Norton 360 Deluxe is one of the least obtrusive or annoying antivirus programs we&rsquo;ve tested&mdash;no unnecessary pop-ups or notifications in sight.

<p>The monitor stand is simple, but solid, with good connectivity options, including four video inputs and a USB hub, the full complement of ergonomic adjustments, and built-in speakers. That alone would make it worth its $729 price. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make me a gaming headset that does everything&rdquo; must have been the design brief behind the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/705178/steelseries-arctis-nova-pro-wireless-headphones-review.html">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless</a>. This top-notch gaming headset offers the most compelling blend of comfort, style, and functionality I&rsquo;ve experienced in 2022. The headset&rsquo;s snugness comes courtesy of a multipronged ComfortMAX system consisting of height adjustable sides, a central flexible tension band, and rotating earcups that provide your head with ample room to move. These features sit alongside plush leatherette ear coverings, and exceptionally stylish gun metal earcup covers that ooze high-end style.</p>



<p>The Nova Pro Wireless also goes the extra mile with connectivity, sporting dual wireless (2.4GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) functionality, as well as wired connectivity&mdash; the latter for Hi-Res 96KHz/24-Bit audio. The dual wireless capability not only allows you to access your audio untethered but also lets you simultaneously take calls, listen to music or chat whilst gaming &ndash; a real treat for multitaskers. Plus, the headset comes with a convenient base controller that lets you switch between your PC and Xbox One and Xbox X/S at the switch of a button.</p>



<p>When it comes to the all-important audio performance, the Nova Pro Wireless nails it. The headset always sounding fantastic, with Active Noise Cancellation, a rich and warm audio profile and a sizeable bass presence that never disappoints. On top of all that, the headset benefits from SteelSeries&rsquo; excellent GG software app, which you can use to personalize your gaming audio exactly how you like it. <em>&ndash; Dominic Bayley</em></p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t easy to select the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html">best overall VPN</a>. There are a ton of contributing factors to consider such as privacy, user interface, server spread, and speed. While before it was common to sacrifice some of these features to gain others, that is no longer the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/395012/expressvpn-review-2.html">ExpressVPN</a> has it all, easily making it our top choice for best VPN. Not only is it one of the fastest VPNs we have ever tested, but it has plenty of country locations to choose from, it&rsquo;s very easy to use, and it offers wide device support. ExpressVPN also regularly has third-party auditors review their services in order to reinforce their privacy credentials. Currently there aren&rsquo;t any other VPNs out there offering the same level of features and value as ExpressVPN. <em>&mdash;Sam Singleton</em></p>

You can prop it up like a tent for watching movies or rotate the screen around and use it like a handheld tablet. The laptop itself weighs just a little over three pounds, making a perfectly capable travel companion. It also has a colorful 2256&times;1504 touch-enabled display, all-day battery life, and a wide array of ports. The build is surprisingly robust as well. If you don&rsquo;t need Windows, the Spin 17 is a great everyday.&nbsp;<em>&mdash;Ashley Biancuzzo</em></p>

<p>One keyboard stood out for both quality and value this year: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/823922/keychron-q5-mechanical-keyboard-review.html">the Keychron Q5</a>. That isn&rsquo;t to say that it&rsquo;s cheap &mdash; it starts at $175, and it&rsquo;s a little over $200 fully loaded. (Which is still cheaper than many &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; designs!) But that gets you an incredible amount of features and so much quality you&rsquo;ll find it hard to go back to a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; board.</p>



<p>Full aluminum construction, high-quality switches, excellent keycaps, and a foam gasket mount make the keyboard feel incredible right out of the box. Hot-swap switches and VIA programming make customization easy and inviting. And the thing&rsquo;s so solid you could use it as an anchor.</p>



<p>You can extend this recommendation to Keychron&rsquo;s entire Q series, which all use the same design for a variety of layouts. Check out the Keychron Q8 and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.keychron.com/pages/keychron-q10-customizable-mechanical-keyboard&amp;xcust=2-2-1369330-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Q10</a>, if you want to combine these features with some subtle ergonomics. <em>&mdash;Michael Crider</em></p>

<p>No graphics card? No problem. Folks blessed with good Internet have an abundance of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/823826/best-cloud-gaming-services.html">game streaming services</a> to choose from these days, but for PC gamers specifically, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/630335/geforce-now-review.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce Now</a> is the best of the bunch.</p>



<p>While you do have to purchase many of the games that you can play on this service&mdash;GFN hooks into your existing PC store accounts, like Steam, instead of providing a library of &ldquo;free&rdquo; games like Xbox Cloud Gaming (or Netflix)&mdash;GeForce Now brings some of the best visual quality, a massive game compatibility list, and a free membership plan option. With that in mind, there&rsquo;s literally no reason not to jump in and at least try out some free games like<em> Fortnite </em>or <em>League of Legends</em>&nbsp;to see if it works for you. And if you do dig it (or can&rsquo;t find an affordable GPU), the top-tier RTX 3080 offering brings the might of that kick-ass graphics card to bear, complete with ray traced visuals, support for higher resolutions at faster speeds, and priority server access. <em>&mdash;Brad Chacos</em></p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t move massive amounts of ultra-large files, you probably don&rsquo;t need to splurge on a pricey cutting-edge PCIe 4.0 SSD&mdash;a standard PCIe 3.0 drive will do you just fine. The best bargain we&rsquo;ve reviewed this year? The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/793848/crucial-p3-review-top-pcie-3-speed-insanely-low-price.html">Crucial P3</a>. It offers excellent everyday storage performance for gaming, content creation, and more, and better yet, it&rsquo;s one of the first fast NVMe drives to drop under 10 cents per gig&mdash;you can pick up a 500GB model for $43, while a 1TB version costs a paltry $74 at press time. The Crucial P3 offers a whole lot of fast storage for a <em>very</em> compelling price. <em>&mdash;Brad Chacos</em></p>

<p>This year, not one but two fantastic mainstream processors launched, with both the Intel Core i5-13600K and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1338944/amd-ryzen-5-7600x-review-a-great-cpu-muted-by-am5s-high-costs.html">AMD Ryzen 5 7600X</a> posting ridiculous numbers. But as impressive as AMD&rsquo;s latest is, Intel edges it out with faster gaming performance and cheaper compatible hardware. For PC builders on a budget, it&rsquo;s hard to beat Intel&rsquo;s wider selection of affordable motherboards, especially when they support inexpensive DDR4 memory. Intel&rsquo;s Core i5-13600K earns our easily recommendation for PC gamers who don&rsquo;t have an infinite budget. <em>&mdash;Alaina Yee</em></p>

<p>If you take your PC gaming seriously, you want a display that elevates the experience with excellent color and contrast, superior motion performance, and an ultrawide screen expanse that fully immerses you in the action.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/624305/alienware-aw3423dw-review-quantum-dot-oled-makes-rival-monitors-feel-obsolete.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Alienware&rsquo;s AW3423DW</a>&nbsp;checks all those boxes, and then some. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It all starts with the cutting-edge OLED panel using Quantum Dot technology (a first of its kind), which gives the 34-inch, 3440&times;1440 display some key advantages over its IPS counterparts: backlight-free deep, inky blanks alongside the panel&rsquo;s rich color reproduction, and near-instant pixel response times (aided by a refresh rate up to 175Hz).&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while the curved monitor surpasses the competition in gaming, its 1800R radius is still serviceable for non-gaming use. Combine that with a stand that offers height, tilt, and swivel adjustments, an attractive and sturdy design, and a fair price for its premium feature set, and you can see why our reviewer proclaimed: &ldquo;The Alienware AW3423DW makes every other 34-inch ultrawide gaming monitor obsolete.&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>&mdash;Katherine Stevenson</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Who else could it be but the OG PDF editor? <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407201/adobe-acrobat-pro-dc-review.html">Adobe Acrobat Pro DC</a> has been, and continues to be, the undisputed king of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407214/best-pdf-editors.html">PDF Editors</a>. Its combination of features for editing, creating, reviewing, and security are the industry standard and what most of its competitors can only attempt to emulate.</p>



<p>In the latest version, they redesigned the interface to make it easier to navigate the robust toolset. Additionally they added a cloud subscription option and a mobile app for both iOS and Android&mdash;both great services for individuals and small businesses. Adobe Acrobat Pro DC is a subscription-based service, meaning that you will always have access to the latest version and don&rsquo;t have to buy new software every year. <em>&mdash;Sam Singleton</em></p>

<p>Our pick for the best Thunderbolt dock of 2022 is the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/918583/kensington-sd5500t-thunderbolt-3-dock-review.html">Kensington SD5500T Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C Docking Station</a>, and here&rsquo;s why: smart compromises. One of the complaints readers have is that Thunderbolt docks are useful, but they&rsquo;re so damn expensive, pushing north of $300. Kensington&rsquo;s SD5000T (a slightly cheaper clone of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813295/iogear-thunderbolt-3-dock-pro-review.html">IOGear Thunderbolt 3 Dock Pro</a>) is about $215 at press time. Price matters.</p>



<p>The advantage of a newer, more expensive Thunderbolt <em>4</em> dock isn&rsquo;t bandwidth, but stricter compatibility restrictions. In this case, we haven&rsquo;t had any issues with this Thunderbolt <em>3</em> dock at all. You might notice that our pick only includes a pair of DisplayPort options for external monitor connectivity &mdash; while we appreciate more flexibility, all but bargain-basement monitors now include DisplayPort ports. With a smart mix of ports and 60W of laptop charging power, we think this is the best Thunderbolt dock for the largest audience right now. <em>&mdash;Mark Hachman</em></p>

<p>You can find a decent monitor for less than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/828353/nzxt-canvas-27q-monitor-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">NZXT Canvas 27Q</a>, but a recent $70 price drop makes this already impressive debut display an even better value. As with our other monitor picks, the 27Q can meet the demands of work and play. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The 27-inch, 2560&times;1440 IPS panel has a 165Hz refresh rate and support for adaptive sync with both AMD and Nvidia graphics cards. Motion clarity in games is good at default settings, and can be further enhanced with an &ldquo;MPRT&rdquo; backlight-strobing mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For content creation tasks, you&rsquo;ll find that the 27Q delivers great image quality and a wide color gamut that&rsquo;s impressive for the price. It&rsquo;s also unique in offering black or white color options, which can be mixed and matched between the panel itself and the stand (sold separately for $40).&nbsp;<em>&mdash;Katherine Stevenson</em></p>

<p>I keep returning to this esports-friendly 2.4GHz wireless mouse for its mix of lightweight handling, comfort, precision, and predictability in a range of different games. Under the hood, it&rsquo;s powered by a 16,000 DPI Pixart PAW3335 sensor. You&rsquo;d be forgiven for thinking is a little underpowered compared to some 20,000 to 30,000 DPI sensors on the market, but it&rsquo;s not, providing an extremely fast 1000Hz (1ms) polling rate, and proving quick and responsive in fps games like <em>Overwatch</em> and <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>.</p>



<p>The switches are nice and clicky, the mouse is rated for a long 100-hour battery, and the unusual honeycomb design feels both lightweight and responsive in your hand. It&rsquo;s a great gaming mouse, full stop, but the price makes it even better: The HyperX Pulsefire Haste Wireless costs just $60 in an era where top-notch gaming mice go for $100 or more. You can&rsquo;t go wrong. <em>&mdash;Dominic Bayley</em></p>

<p>Always a favorite of ours here at PCWorld, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/605046/r-drive-image-7-review-the-best-backup-now-looks-the-part.html">R-Drive Image</a> is a consistently solid <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407021/best-windows-backup-software.html">Windows backup software</a>. But it wasn&rsquo;t until the latest version 7 was released that it jumped ahead to take our top spot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It not only consumes pleasantly few system resources, but it&rsquo;s ultra-reliable when creating backup images of partitions and disks. The latest version improves upon this with a more modern, user-friendly interface and adds a welcomed partition management as well as new file and folder backup systems. It has practically made itself a one-stop solution for backing up on Windows. At less than $50 for a license, it&rsquo;s quite affordable as well and is a no-brainer for people looking for reliable backup software. <em>&mdash;Sam Singleton</em></p>

Day or night, front or back views, it&rsquo;s got you covered with best-in-class video captures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The quality of the device itself is top-notch. The main unit has a solid heft and uses a semi-permanent mount with a built-in GPS unit. On the back is a 3-inch color touchscreen that&rsquo;s easy to use; voice control is also an option. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Being a premium product, it has all the bells and whistles: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, mapping, an SD card, and 3.5mm jack for an optional $80 1080p, 120-degree FOV interior camera. But the real stars of the show are the incredibly clear and detailed 4K, 140-degree FOV front captures and 1080p, 120-degree FOV rear captures. As our reviewer described it: &ldquo;The Cobra SC 400D is experientially one of the nicest dash cams I&rsquo;ve ever tested.&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>&mdash;Katherine Stevenson</em></p>

## AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX revealed: 5 crucial details PC gamers need to know

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>After a so-called &ldquo;lost generation&rdquo; for graphics cards plagued by shortages and scalpers, things are finally looking up for PC gamers&mdash;and the battle for next-generation GPU supremacy has finally arrived. Nvidia launched its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">ferocious GeForce RTX 4090</a> mere weeks ago, but its monitor-melting lead isn&rsquo;t going uncontested for long. This week, AMD revealed its next-gen RDNA 3 architecture and two GPUs serving as its paragon: the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1370428/amd-rdna-3-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-reveal.html">Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT</a>.</p>



<p>This ain&rsquo;t your momma&rsquo;s GPU throw-down though. AMD is doing some radically different things with RDNA 3 and the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, and we&rsquo;ve never seen a graphics card quite like <em>this </em>before. We&rsquo;ve already covered the Radeon RX 7900 XTX&rsquo;s technical notes in-depth in our announcement coverage, but if you don&rsquo;t feel like sifting through a discussion of dual-issue wave 32 instructions and memory-controller vagaries, here are the five key facts about RDNA 3 and the Radeon RX 7900 XTX that PC gamers absolutely need to know before the launch on December 13.</p>



<h2>1. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT are a <em>lot </em>cheaper than Nvidia&rsquo;s offerings</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX reveal" class="wp-image-1370461" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AMD-RDNA-3-Radeon-RX-7900-XTX-7.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>



<p>First, the price: It&rsquo;s hard to call graphics cards that set you back four figures a bargain, per se, but it appears AMD heard the outrage generated by Nvidia&rsquo;s pricing of $1,600 for the GeForce RTX 4090 and $1,200 for the RTX 4080. By contrast, RDNA 3&rsquo;s flagship Radeon RX 7900 XTX will set you back &ldquo;just&rdquo; $999, and the single-X Radeon RX 7900 XT costs $899.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s the same price as the Radeon RX 6900 XT before it. Nvidia, on the other hand, increased the price of the RTX 4090 by $100 over the RTX 3090, while the RTX 4080 costs a whopping $400&mdash;<em>50 percent</em>&mdash;more than the RTX 3080.</p>



<h2 id="2-rdna-3-chiplets-ftw">2. RDNA 3 chiplets FTW</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX reveal" class="wp-image-1370457" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AMD-RDNA-3-Radeon-RX-7900-XTX-8.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>A Radeon RX 7900 XTX chip; see the six memory dies flanking the core GPU die?</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>



<p>Part of those cost savings no doubt stem from the radical new technical design of the RDNA 3 GPUs. Traditionally, GPUs were built using huge &ldquo;monolithic&rdquo; dies that cram all necessary bits inside. But with RDNA 3, AMD is swiping a page from its ultra-successful Ryzen playbook. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT use several chiplets working together on the same package instead: a core GPU die surrounded by up to six memory cache dies that hold the card&rsquo;s Infinity Cache and memory controllers.</p>



<p>We wade deeper into technical details in our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1370428/amd-rdna-3-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-reveal.html">RDNA 3 announcement coverage</a>, but the upshot is AMD can use TSMC&rsquo;s cutting-edge 5nm manufacturing process to spit out an abundance of smaller 300mm GPU dies, then use its cheaper and more mature 6nm process for the memory dies. That helps AMD keep costs down on both nodes, and no doubt helps the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT achieve their more palatable prices. The central RDNA 3 GPU die measures just 300mm squared. Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 4090 die is over twice as large, and all of it is made using TSMC&rsquo;s expensive cutting-edge node.</p>



<h2 id="3-powerful-but-not-overpowered">3. Powerful but not overpowered</h2>



<p>Nvidia swung for the fences with its GeForce RTX 4090, pushing a monstrous 450 watts through that massive GPU die and cutting-edge GDDR6X memory for truly face-melting performance, power use (and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1361471/multiple-rtx-4090-owners-report-melting-12vhpwr-power-cables.html">melting 12VHPWR adapters</a>) be damned.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX reveal" class="wp-image-1370459" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AMD-RDNA-3-Radeon-RX-7900-XTX-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>



<p>But in a world crippled by an energy crisis, power efficiency matters. AMD thankfully stayed true to its efficiency focus with RDNA 3, delivering a claimed 54 percent improvement in performance-per-watt over the already-impressive RDNA 2 graphics cards. That, in turn, let AMD stick to saner power requirements&mdash;both the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT only require a pair of standard 8-pin power connectors. They draw 355 watts and 300 watts, respectively. The more modest power requirements mean that AMD&rsquo;s reference cards stick to slightly-chonky-but-fine 2.5-slot designs, compared to the 3- and even 4-slot monsters common to RTX 4090 models.</p>



<p>Bottom line? Upgrading from a recent Radeon or Nvidia graphics card to a new Radeon RX 7900 XTX won&rsquo;t require reconfiguring your rig or being a beta tester for a troublesome new power connector. Yay!</p>



<h2 id="4-rdna-3-av1-displayport-2-1-and-more">4. RDNA 3 AV1, DisplayPort 2.1, and more</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX reveal" class="wp-image-1370460" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AMD-RDNA-3-Radeon-RX-7900-XTX-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Mmmmmmm DisplayPort 2.1.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>



<p>AMD fluffs out RDNA 3 with some compelling extras, too. Unlike Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 40-series GPUs, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT feature DisplayPort 2.1, which unlocks monitor refresh rates up to 4K/480 (yes, <em>480Hz</em>) and 8K/165. Gotta go fast! AMD&rsquo;s new dual media engine also supports simultaneous encode/decode of HEVC/AVC streams, as well as bleeding-edge AV1 encoding, joining ranks with Nvidia and Intel&rsquo;s recent GPU offerings.</p>



<p>These upgrades may not mean much to you if you&rsquo;re not a content creator, but they&rsquo;re very welcome indeed.</p>



<h2 id="5-will-it-beat-the-rtx-4090-who-knows">5. Will it beat the RTX 4090? Who knows!</h2>



<p>Finally, the elephant in the room: Will AMD&rsquo;s Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT topple <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s vaunted GeForce RTX 4090</a>? That remains to be seen&mdash;always wait for independent reviews!&mdash;but the initial presentation leaves the prospect looking questionable.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD RDNA 3 Radeon details" class="wp-image-1370468" height="670" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/radeon-rx-7900-xtx-vs-6900-4k.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD RDNA 3 Radeon details" class="wp-image-1370474" height="655" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/radeon-rx-7900-xtx-4k-ray-tracing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD RDNA 3 Radeon details" class="wp-image-1370472" height="670" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/radeon-rx-7900-xtx-4k-esports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>Don&rsquo;t take this the wrong way: The Radeon RX 7900 XTX will be a brutally fast performer if the charts AMD provided prove accurate. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/699131/sapphire-nitro-amd-radeon-rx-6650-xt-6750-xt-6950-xt-pure-review.html">Radeon RX 6950 XT</a> already beat the RTX 3090, and AMD says the Radeon RX 7900 XTX is 1.5x to 1.7x faster than the 6950 XT at 4K gaming (for $250 less). Likewise, AMD added AI cores to RDNA 3, meeting a key Nvidia feature, and modified Radeon&rsquo;s ray-tracing cores for up to 50 percent higher performance. But I&rsquo;m not sure even that huge uptick will be enough to best Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 4090 and 4080 in ray tracing after GeForce&rsquo;s similarly huge uplift this generation. And crucially, AMD&rsquo;s benchmarks didn&rsquo;t make any comparisons to the RTX 4090 whatsoever, even though the 4090 has been available for weeks now. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Between those tidbits and the much lower $999/$899 price tags, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT could wind up competing with the RTX 4080 instead&mdash;but with so many new technologies at play in RDNA 3 it&rsquo;s hard to prognosticate too heavily. We&rsquo;ll have to wait for independent reviews to launch to know for sure. </p>
