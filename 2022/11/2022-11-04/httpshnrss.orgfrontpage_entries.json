15:46:38+00:00", "description": "<p>Hi, I\u2019m Chris, one of the co-founders of Shimmer (<a href=\"https://shimmer.care\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://shimmer.care</a>). We offer one-to-one ADHD Coaching for adults. It was born out of my own roller coaster of a journey navigating my ADHD diagnosis.<p>Getting diagnosed with ADHD as an adult is complicated\u2014equally heartbreaking and liberating. You literally need to rewrite your whole life narrative in light of this new realization. The process currently is super confusing and expensive (medications, therapy, coaching, tools, apps, etc.) and I just wished someone would guide me through it. Someone to personalize things for me, ask me good questions, and encourage me when I was feeling down.<p>My experience was the basis for what Shimmer is today. We\u2019re creating an ADHD coaching service that is actually affordable (5-10X cheaper than traditional ADHD coaching, in fact!), personalized to your life (because what works for me may not work for you), and focused on action instead of theory (because we\u2019re not short of knowledge\u2014we just aren\u2019t <i>doing</i> it!).<p>Our service is fit for ADHD brains. We merge the best worlds of telehealth (e.g. therapy/coaching sessions) and asynchronous apps (e.g. Headspace, Noom) to create a solid combo of human accountability and app-based support. You get matched with an ADHD-specialized coach, meet weekly in focused video/audio sessions where you set weekly goals, and over time, bit-by-bit start building a new day-to-day that supports your goals: new routines, systems, and skills.<p>Our program is rooted in science-backed methodologies including Health & Wellness Coaching, Cognitive Behavioral Coaching (CBC/CBT), Acceptance Commitment Training (ACT), positive psychology, and solution-focused coaching. The way we deliver it, however, is less rigid and more experimental. In each 15-min session and in the asynchronous portions, you\u2019ll draw on collective ADHD community knowledge to work with one thing a week in your life that you\u2019d like to improve on. Your coach will support you via text access (in-app) and by seeing and reacting to your weekly \u201cActions\u201d.<p>In terms of the app itself, there are 3 main components: (1) a daily/weekly simple check-list where you track your coaching tasks, checking them off (automatically pings your coach) and reflecting on your progress in-app, (2) a resource hub where you\u2019ll find short, bite-sized content in service of your coaching journey, not standalone education to just \u201cread up on\u201d, and (3) your personalized chat with your coach where they\u2019ll guide you through the journey\u2014checking in on your completed/in-completed tasks, giving you feedback, and sending you resources.<p>On the back end, our coaches have web and mobile apps that are designed to save them time and cognitive effort, so that they can focus on coaching. Simple things like \u201cscheduled sends\u201d and a prioritized message list are included to help them manage a large case load with less effort.<p>It\u2019s $99/mo. for 15-min weekly \u201cbite-sized\u201d sessions, or $349/mo. for 45-min \u201csimilar-to-traditional\u201d coaching sessions. Traditional coaching can run $400-700+/mo. (up to the thousands depending on the coach). We also reserve a portion of our memberships for those with financial need, on a case by case basis.<p>If you have ADHD (or think you do), we\u2019d love for you to check out our platform and give us critical feedback (or positive reinforcement!).

You can integrate it with Docker, GitHub Actions and Node. Your tests can have multiple steps, with shared context between them. Lastly, you can use it as a library and in combination with other testing tools like Jest, Ava, Mocha (and soon Insomnia).<p>If you want to step out of locked-in cloud solutions, give our tool a

reading a lot these days about lay-offs in tech companies and how many HN users (mainly from US?) are having a hard time finding top-level paying jobs.<p>I work on Western Europe, and in theory we should be more screwed up than other Western countries... but:<p>- Just landed (3 months ago) on a job that pays me 20% more than the previous one. I could have switched jobs years before, but I just got the courage to do it now<p>- Keep seeing the same amount of job offers on Linkedin. Now, I have the tendency to keep a list of companies that hire on an Excel file, so I can come back to it later and compare past and current situations of such companies. I have over 200 companies that operate in Western Europe (but not exclusively) that I consider \"top-level\" (at least from my point of view). The effect of the recession? Well, it has had one, but somehow very poor: many companies went from having around 1000 job offers open in linkedin on a weekly basis to having now around a third of that. Sure, they are not hiring like crazy anymore, but they are still hiring!<p>- A company that announced a 14% lay-off back in May, is now hiring again (the same pattern as before: when they were offering thousands of jobs before, now they are offering a few hundred)<p>Now, I have no idea how FAANG is doing in Western Europe (I never cared to track them) because I have no plans to work for them. But all the other non-FAANG companies over here are hiring. So, I don't feel the recession (yet).

I didn't even know the basic of the things like, how much hrs of content should I watch daily to not get overwhelmed?<p>And selecting good courses was another confusion. A course in html, css would be 40 hr long (with project). That'd take 40 days to complete. Can anyone remain patient for 40 days to learn html, css on their own w/o any structure and guidance? I could not.<p>Please tell me your tips for being a self taught developer.<p>I do have a degree in computer science but degree in CS vs programming is different.
