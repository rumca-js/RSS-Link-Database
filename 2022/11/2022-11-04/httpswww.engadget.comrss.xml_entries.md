<p>Something’s going on at Virgin Hyperloop, the startup attempting to bring Elon Musk’s vision of high-speed trains to life. At some point in the last few weeks, the company has quietly changed its name back to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-12-richard-branson-and-virgin-join-forces-with-hyperloop-one.html">Hyperloop One</a>, the brand it used between 2016 and 2017. Its website has been scrubbed clean, too, using an old stock image of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-02-hyperloop-one-first-pod-xp1-test.html">XP-1 test pod</a> and the claim that “It’s a new day at Hyperloop One,” too.</p><p>This isn’t just a website issue, as the <a href="https://twitter.com/hyperloop__one">Twitter</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6deefbf2-941b-4156-9f41-a61ebb50d13d&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LinkedIn&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2ZGVlZmJmMi05NDFiLTQxNTYtOWY0MS1hNjFlYmI1MGQxM2QiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGlua2VkaW4uY29tL2NvbXBhbnkvaHlwZXJsb29wb25lL2Fib3V0LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTA0NmEwMmItOTBlZC00OTMxLTlmMzktMjRjZjVhMTQ3MDc5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAZXP2rEorx4j0XWzT1Z_Ro_OsiZzJJmH1IbfG-8ohPvM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fhyperloopone%2Fabout%2F">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/virginhyperloop/?hl=en">Instagram</a> accounts have all reverted to the old logo and name as well. And the change has to be fairly recent — <a href="https://twitter.com/hyperloop__one/status/1583606061881511936">a tweet posted October 22nd</a> still carried the Virgin logo and name. While we can't speculate on precisely what prompted the change, it appears to be a deliberate effort towards de-branding. Seemingly, Richard Branson and Virgin are now no longer willing to share a brand with the logistics company.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company has certainly seen a number of changes through this year, laying off 111 staffers and abandoning its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-hyperloop-kills-passenger-transport-go-cargo-only-111823967.html">much-hyped attempt to build a passenger system</a>. After that, majority owner DP World said that it would pivot toward using the technology for logistics, enabling the construction of "inland ports" to ferry cargo containers to their eventual destination faster than the present system.</p><p>We have reached out to Virgin, Hyperloop One and (partner) DP World in the hope of getting some sort of clarification on the change, and will update this if we hear back.</p>

## Watch the last total lunar eclipse until 2025 on November 8th

<p>You're about to get your last chance at witnessing a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-27-supermoon-eclipse-2015.html">total lunar eclipse</a> for quite some time. NASA has pointed out that the last such eclipse until March 2025 begins in the early morning hours of November 8th in North America. Parts of Asia, Australia, New Zealand and South America can also get a glimpse. The partial eclipse will start at 4:09AM Eastern, with totality lasting from 4:16AM through 5:42AM. The ending partial phase will finish at 6:49AM. Those on the eastern US coast will miss some or all of that last segment as the Moon sets. However, you might not have to venture outside if it's too chilly — there are ways to watch from the warmth of home.</p><p>Livestreams will be available. Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsXS3iDs0yA">will offer</a> multiple telescope views of the total lunar eclipse starting at 4AM Eastern. Timeanddate.com will have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjKUlaGmE2g">streams</a> in multiple cities, including its own view from Roswell, New Mexico as well as feeds from San Diego and Perth in Australia. The Virtual Telescope Project will also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYvDZsxDiTE">provide</a> international coverage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="1acab2ffd60546b0be941ed2381b73a4"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>You'll want to have a look even if 2025 doesn't seem that far away. Total lunar eclipses (where the Earth sits directly between the Moon and Sun) earn their "blood Moon" nickname due to the optical tricks that paint the lunar surface a dramatic red. Where short-wavelength blue light tends to get caught in the particles of Earth's atmosphere, the longer wavelengths of red, orange and yellow help them complete the cosmic journey. It's a stunning effect you can see with your naked eyes. And if you have a telescope, you may even spot <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-24-uranus-might-have-two-more-moons.html">Uranus</a> in the distance.</p><p>There will be partial and penumbral lunar eclipses during the interval. The first visible in the Americas will take place on October 28th, 2023, with others due on March 25th and September 18th the following year. You're not completely out of luck, then, even if those events won't be quite so eye-catching.</p>

<p>The weather has started to get cooler, but that doesn’t mean it’s time to head indoors for winter just yet. There’s ample time to enjoy the backyard, porch or balcony before the first snowfall. We’ve rounded up the best outdoor gear for cooking, relaxing and imbibing this fall, from a pizza oven, to a uniquely designed fire pit and a smart outlet for your outdoor lighting.</p><h2>Solo Stove Pi</h2><figure><img alt="Solo Stove Pi" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/7c931b90-5c53-11ed-9eb6-2b29c31a8b40" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Solo Stove</div></figure><p>Ooni may be the biggest name in at-home pizza ovens these days, and rightfully so: Those products produce outstanding results.

The Demi-Dome construction and wide opening gives you easy access to launch and rotate pies with ease. Plus, the Pi is made of stainless steel just like Solo Stove’s fire pits so it should last a good long while. Lastly, the company also offers a range of cooking accessories and supplies, including a Neapolitan pizza box with dough, sauce, whole-milk mozz and pepperoni.

The setup works like Philips Hue, but for bugs. Repellers connect to a base station via cables and then you can connect other repellers to each other to create a system that’s as large as you need it (up to five). That controller then connects to your home WiFi so you can monitor everything from your phone. Thermacell says each LIV repeller can protect a 20-foot radius and the cartridge inside will last for up to 40 hours. The company sells three-, four- and five-unit setups starting at $699. That’s certainly not cheap, but the LIV system does over the same mosquito protection I’ve enjoyed on the smaller products like the E-55.</p><a class="athena-button rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVybWFjZWxsLmNvbS9wYWdlcy9saXYtc3lzdGVtIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiMjU1ODhhNS1hMGNlLTMxNGYtODQ0OS1jYzFlMTY2ZTVlZTAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASkMkQD4T3hmKwAeVOCj-xHnuq9luKrrwaaIvbMIPXqt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thermacell.com%2Fpages%2Fliv-system" id="da2431d6685144d4be590d6a748f1fd8">Shop LIV Collection at Thermacell</a><h2>Solo Stove 2.0 firepits</h2><figure><img alt="A Solo Stove fire pit sitting on grass next to fire wood and an American flag at a backyard party." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-07/9fd76450-f93c-11ec-b745-5e8b1b526e29" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Solo Stove</div></figure><p>As the temperatures drop, a fire pit is a cozy place to spend your time.

The first-gen Google Tensor chip and 6.1-inch OLED display compare favorably to most phones in this price range, and while its back is made of plastic, the design doesn't look cheap. It's also IP67-rated for dust and water resistance. The 6a isn't without flaws: There's no headphone jack or wireless charging support, the display is limited to a 60Hz refresh rate, and the battery life, while good, isn't top-of-the-line.

Since it's WiFi-enabled, you can turn it off and on, and set cleaning schedules, through the iRobot app. You still get what you pay for: Pricier robovacs will be more robust at cleaning larger spaces, and they'll do so in a more orderly fashion than the semi-random, "bump and run" style of the 694 here. (A couple of higher-end Roombas <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-irobot-roomba-sale-204819460.html">are also on sale</a> as of this writing.)

It has a particularly comfortable scroll wheel, too. You only get a couple of customizable shortcut buttons, and the whole thing only connects over a USB dongle, not Bluetooth.

## Egg whites could be key to removing microplastics from seawater

<p>Microplastics are a bane that harms wildlife, but you may be staring at the solution to this problem in your breakfast. Princeton researchers have used egg whites to <a href="https://engineering.princeton.edu/news/2022/11/03/researchers-cook-new-way-remove-microplastics-water">create</a> a lightweight, porous aerogel that can remove microplastics and salt from seawater.  When you freeze-dry and superheat the whites (up to 1,652F) in an oxygen-free space, their pure protein system produces a mix of carbon fiber strands and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/graphene-hard-drive-university-of-cambridge-234912178.html">graphene</a> sheets that can remove 99 percent of tiny plastics from water, and 98 percent of the salt. Even fried and whipped eggs work just as well.</p><p>As you might imagine, a readily available organic material like this has its benefits. It's cheap to make, and needs only gravity to work. It won't consume energy or excess water. Activated carbon is cheap, but it's not nearly as effective as the egg white gel. And while eggs from the grocery store prompted the breakthrough, you can use other proteins that won't cut into the population's food supply.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The aerogel isn't ready for widespread use just yet. Scientists need to refine the manufacturing process before mass production is possible. If that happens, though, the implications are clear. It would be comparatively easy to remove microplastics and otherwise purify water while minimizing the environmental impact. While the salt removal may create problems in oceans, it may be very helpful for desalinization in areas where fresh drinking water is difficult to find.</p><p>There are other purposes, for that matter. The gel might also be useful for energy storage and insulation, so don't be surprised if you one day find egg-like proteins in your walls.</p>

## Twitter verification has always been a mess. Charging $8 a month won’t fix it.

<p>It’s only been a matter of days since Elon Musk took over Twitter, but he’s already shaking up the platform in major ways. Few of his ideas have attracted as much attention, or controversy, as his plan to start charging for verification as part of a bigger overhaul to Twitter’s subscription service, Blue.</p><p>Calling the current system “bullshit,” he said that his plan is to add verification as a perk to Twitter Blue, which will increase in price from $5 a month to $8 a month. All users who pay will get the checkmark, while those who don’t — even if they were verified under Twitter's previous system — will lose it. Subscriptions will also reduce ads and make accounts more visible in replies and search, a sort of anti-shadowban.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="49dd6f7ac5624101ad5dcea17396ad55"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Twitter’s current lords &amp; peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark is bullshit. <br /><br />Power to the people! Blue for $8/month.</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587498907336118274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>But while Musk’s plans may win him some fans among those who despise the idea of “blue check Twitter,” it also shows that he fundamentally misunderstands verification. And while he is correct that the current system is broken, charging for verification would make it worse, not better.</p><h2>Verification is about authenticity</h2><p>Musk’s plan ignores the reason verification was created to begin with: to convey authenticity. Because Twitter doesn’t have a real-names policy, a verified badge helps distinguish whether an account belongs to the person or entity whose name is at the top. From Twitter’s <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts"><ins>help center:</ins></a> “The blue Verified badge on Twitter lets people know that an account of public interest is authentic.”</p><p>It may seem like a status symbol to some, but the reason it’s handed out to journalists, celebrities, public officials and other notable figures is because there is inherent risk in <em>not verifying</em> those people.</p><p>“Verification was never meant to convey status,” says Nu Wexler, a policy consultant and former policy communications rep at Twitter. “It was simply a way for Twitter to address impersonation attempts.”</p><figure><img alt="Musk replies that impersonation already happens " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/d7a60270-5c55-11ed-afdb-6f707568389c" style="height: 353; width: 781;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshot via Twitter</div></figure><p>But Musk seems unmoved by concerns about impersonation. In response to a question about whether newly verified users would be able to impersonate Musk himself, he said “that already happens very frequently.”</p><p>Musk isn’t wrong on this point. Hacking verified accounts and then changing their profiles to look like Musk is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46097853"><ins>a known scam</ins></a>. But getting rid of these types of scammers was supposedly one his main motivations for buying Twitter for $44 billion in the first place. (Ironically, scammers are already using the prospect of paid verification as a <a href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel/status/1588233453216346112"><ins>phishing ploy</ins></a>, according to Twitter’s head of safety.)</p><p>Impersonation scams can have real consequences, as actor Robert Kazinsky pointed out in a viral Twitter thread. “I don’t tweet much, I am scared of the internet, I struggle with a lot of things in life. But this account exists so that fake accounts can’t,” he wrote, adding that in the past people impersonating him online have used his identity to start conversations with children.</p><div id="090bcf97d9d947daa1329c1088ef1def"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Verification is a public service, it is a good deed performed by companies who contribute very little good to the world in my opinion. We should be making easier clearer paths to verification for everyone, not making it harder. It is their responsibility, not a business model.</p>— Rob Kazinsky (@RobertKazinsky) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertKazinsky/status/1587935665500880896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>Making verification solely dependent on who is willing to pay for it could have even bigger implications for the spread of misinformation. Around the world, public officials, government agencies, journalists, activists and others use Twitter to communicate important information to the public. Making their verification contingent on paying, or making it easier for someone else to impersonate them, would undermine the idea of Twitter as the “town square” Musk wants it to be.</p><h2>Verification has always been confusing and unfair</h2><p>Musk is correct that Twitter’s existing verification system could be a whole lot better. Verification on Twitter has always been a mess, but not because it’s sometimes perceived as a status symbol.</p><p>The reality is that Twitter has never been able to properly explain how verification works or why some people get it and others don’t. The company introduced it in 2009, but didn’t have a public-facing request tool until 2016. Instead, for nearly a decade, the company would quietly verify celebrities, journalists and other public figures mostly through backchannel connections via agents and public relations staffers. This meant that even some public figures who clearly qualified for it didn’t know how to be verified.</p><p>The decision to open up verification requests to the public in 2016 was supposed to resolve this. But a little more than a year after opening public requests, the company paused the effort amid a backlash after verifying a white nationalist.</p><p>Verification remained “paused” for the next <em>four years</em>. Except it wasn’t entirely on hold. The company continued to quietly grant verification to thousands of accounts via the same behind-the-scenes process it had used for years.In other words: it remains just as opaque and confusing as it ever was.</p><p>Even when Twitter said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-verified-more-than-1000-health-experts-new-verification-push-170028498.html"><ins>expand verification</ins></a> to more doctors and health experts at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was still widespread confusion about how these verifications would occur. Some researchers who were verified as part of the expansion were unsure how it happened.</p><p>Finally, in 2021, Twitter re-opened verification only to pause it — again — after just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-request-verification-150035250.html"><ins>eight days </ins></a>because the company mistakenly verified a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-cormac-mccarthy-verified-144247866.htmlhttps://www.engadget.com/twitter-cormac-mccarthy-verified-144247866.html"><ins>fake Cormac McCarthy</ins></a> account. (Verification requests <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-reopens-public-verifications-165631631.html"><ins>resumed a month</ins></a> later.)</p><h2>Twitter Blue and verification serve different purposes</h2><p>So, yes, verification has always had significant issues. And Musk isn’t even the first to propose verification for everyone as a way to fix it. Former CEO Jack Dorsey said he wanted to open it to everyone back <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/09/twitter-could-let-everyone-get-a-blue-tick-for-verification-jack-dorsey.html"><ins>in 2018</ins></a>. ““The intention is to open verification for everyone … And people can verify more facts about themselves and we don’t have to be the judge or imply any bias on our part,” he said in a livestream.</p><p>But making verification part of Twitter Blue, which is designed to provide extra perks for those who pay, doesn’t address the underlying issue. While it may theoretically give everyone the <em>opportunity</em> to be verified, it also creates new incentives for people trying to take advantage of the platform, says Wexler.</p><p>“There's a market for Twitter to charge power uses for certain features like an edit button or priority customer service,” he says. “But selling authenticity is just inviting bad actors to impersonate elected officials and news outlets.”</p><p>One solution would be to separate verification and identity authentication. And even Musk seems to recognize the need for additional context for some accounts. He <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587527711228149765"><ins>said</ins></a> there “will be a secondary tag below the name for someone who is a public figure, which is already the case for politicians.”</p><div id="91bcf47eb3764f92b5e15480c05a1826"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Is this Twitter’s NEW verification badge? <br /><br />Spotted on an internal version of Twitter<br /><br />h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/KurtWagner8?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@KurtWagner8</a><a href="https://t.co/hQZTq0gdRU">pic.twitter.com/hQZTq0gdRU</a></p>— Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1588146115014189060?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>An early version of this appears to have already surfaced, on Dorsey’s Twitter account, which according to a screenshot of an internal build of the service, had an “official account” label underneath his blue check.</p><p>But extra labels don’t address the real danger that would be posed by the impersonators verification was created to fight.</p>

## Footage of Hideo Kojima's next game may have leaked in bizarre fashion

<p>For many people, the list of their most hotly anticipated video games will include "whatever <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/hideo%20kojima/"><ins>Hideo Kojima</ins></a> is working on." If you're one of those folks, you may be interested to learn that a video showing the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/death%20stranding/"><em><ins>Death Stranding</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>auteur's next title seems to have leaked ahead of a formal reveal from his studio, Kojima Productions.</p><p>The video, which has been removed from Streamable for violating the platform's terms of service, shows a character who looks like Mama from <em>Death Stranding. </em>That character was played by <em>Maid</em> and <em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood </em>actor Margaret Qualley. The character shown here navigates dark corridors with the help of a flashlight while an ominous figure follows them. Eventually, someone or some<em>thing </em>catches up to them. A game over screen is then shown, along with text reading "A Hideo Kojima Game" and "Overdose."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Reporter Tom Henderson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-overdose-gameplay-leaked/"><ins>noted</ins></a> that the footage was the same as the leaked video he described in June at <a href="https://tryhardguides.com/hideo-kojimas-new-horror-game-is-dubbed-overdose/"><em><ins>Try Hard Guides</ins></em></a>. Kojima Productions seemingly asked him to take down the initial report — a request that <em>Try Hard </em>declined.</p><p>The presentation of the video is bizarre. The gameplay footage has a picture-in-picture view of a person seemingly playing the game, as though they are a Twitch streamer. Text reading "camera player 1" appears at the top of the screen, suggesting that this is from a playtest. The footage appears on a YouTube-style interface, indicating that it may have been stored on Google Drive. It gets stranger, because someone has filmed that footage offscreen. That version of the video is then played on a tablet, which, according to a pretty prominent reflection on that screen, is being filmed offscreen a second time by a shirtless person.</p><p>It's all very unusual. As <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23440326/hideo-kojima-new-game-overdose-leak-margaret-qualley"><em><ins>Polygon</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>notes, there's at least a small chance that the footage is fake, even though creating it would require a lot of effort from some prankster. Qualley's character model looks just like the one used in <em>Death Stranding</em> —which may indicate that <em>Overdose </em>is a direct follow-up to Kojima's last game. It's also odd to see the name of a game's creator pop up during a game over screen, though this is likely work-in-progress footage (though it's not impossible to imagine Kojima actually putting his name on a game over screen).&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, we may not have to wait too much longer to gain more clarity as to what's going on here. Kojima has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hideo-kojima-elle-fanning-game-teaser-182532503.html"><ins>teasing</ins></a> his next project, and he's a regular presence at The Game Awards, the next edition of which takes place in a month. Kojima is developing a game <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hideo-kojima-next-game-xbox-game-studios-183606097.html"><ins>in partnership with Microsoft</ins></a>, but a <em>Death Stranding </em>sequel is reportedly in the works too.</p><p>If the reports and rumors hold up, <em>Overdose </em>will be the first full horror game from Kojima. The only horror project that the Metal Gear creator has released to date is <em>P.T.</em>, an infamous playable teaser <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kojima-pt-silent-hills-ps5-backward-compatability-205847752.html"><ins>that's no longer available</ins></a>.

## DALL-E's AI art generation is now available for apps

<p>You won't have to visit a specific website to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dall-e-ai-image-generator-beta-no-waitlist-173746483.html">use DALL-E 2</a> for much longer. OpenAI has publicly <a href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-api-now-available-in-public-beta/">released</a> a beta framework that lets apps and other products use the AI art generator. This includes the natural language descriptions that define DALL-E as well as moderation to filter out hate, gore and similar extreme content.&nbsp;</p><p>A handful of customers are already using the technology. Microsoft's new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-designer-dall-e-2-annouced-140007501.html">Designer app</a> uses DALL-E to create artwork for social media, documents and invitations. The AI image tool is coming to Bing and Edge to help you make art when you can't find what you need. <a href="https://ca.la/">Cala</a>, meanwhile, is a "fashion and lifestyle operating system" that uses the tool to produce new designs. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taXh0aWxlcy5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlY2U4NWViOC03N2ZmLTQ2YmMtYTM1Mi03Nzk4YTliOWNkNjIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVSbDNd5asx18EhV0n9zF-qun0v3f4Ioux68NBMDkub_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixtiles.com%2F">Mixtiles</a> can use the system to produce one-of-a-kind wall art.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>OpenAI is using this launch to further expand your control over your art. You now have full ownership rights to the images you make, not just usage rights — the company is more comfortable handing over control now that its technology minimizes the potential for content policy violations. Whatever you build, you can now organize it into public and private collections. If you make a lot of space-themed pieces, for instance, you won't have to sift through the rest of your gallery to find them.</p><p>The toolkit and increased rights won't settle the question of whether or not AI-generated art is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dall-e-generative-ai-tracking-data-privacy-160034656.html">borrowed or stolen</a>. They may even lead to more friction as DALL-E is used in more places. While companies like Shutterstock are working with OpenAI to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/shutterstock-ai-generated-stock-images-dall-e-133903619.html">sell AI-generated images</a>, others are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/getty-images-ai-generated-content-ban-153337930.html">banning the technology</a> over fears of copyright disputes. It may be a while before app developers can use offerings like DALL-E without some ethical or legal concerns.</p>

## What we bought: An ode to the Koss KSC75, still the oddest and best-sounding headphones $20 can buy

<p>I’ve reviewed consumer tech professionally for a little over a decade now, and in that time I’ve worn hundreds of headphones. I’ve tested <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/focal-utopia-review-worlds-best-headphones-2016-8">reference pairs</a> that cost as much as $4,000, played with tons of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/08/the-best-gaming-headsets-for-your-console-or-gaming-pc/">gaming headsets</a>, and seen firsthand (first-ear?) as the industry has shifted toward <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2021/11/best-black-friday-headphone-deals-2021/">wireless models</a> with increasing computer-like functionality.</p><p>And yet, for people who really care about how their music sounds, the easiest recommendation I can give is still a 17-year-old pair of wired “clip-on” headphones that cost $20 and look like something you’d get for free on a flight in the ‘90s. I purchased my first <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwMDA2QjQ4NksvcmVmPW94X3NjX2FjdF90aXRsZV8xP3NtaWQ9QTFKNjZDWktGNDhYSDYmcHNjPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMXEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImJiNDViYzA0LThjOTAtNGFhYS04NGJkLWNkODk1ODMzYTk3YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaOuzADY9mNZBiW9hj4Iaw6k5k2g79ZJMwzFAM0scPBS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0006B486K%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Fsmid%3DA1J66CZKF48XH6%26psc%3D1">pair of Koss KSC75s</a> many years ago, but for my money, they remain the best-sounding <em>audio thing</em> you can buy for $20. In a market that regularly uses the power of #branding to get you to pay more for basic functionality, the KSC75 are an honest anomaly. They promise quality sound at a consumer-friendly price and nothing more, and they deliver on that.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A brief history lesson: The KSC75 arrived in 2005 as a more affordable follow-up to the Koss KSC35, a similar set of ear-clip-style headphones that launched in 1995 and <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Lb3NzLUhlYWRwaG9uZXMtUGl2b3RpbmctRGVzaWduLUxpZ2h0d2VpZ2h0L2RwL0IwODRHV1BHMVE_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMXEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImJiNDViYzA0LThjOTAtNGFhYS04NGJkLWNkODk1ODMzYTk3YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATPzk9X1f-fSNZytqZ7iwJqs0KjWIBNq2gvVMnB9KQvt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKoss-Headphones-Pivoting-Design-Lightweight%2Fdp%2FB084GWPG1Q">cost $45</a>.

The KSC75 (and a few others) use a version of the driver coated in titanium, however; this, combined with their lightly-clamping fit and open-back design, gives the KSC75 their own sort of sound by comparison.</p><p>And that sound is great. The emphasis here is on the midrange, which largely comes off as balanced and natural. There’s a bit of extra brightness to the treble, but not so much that higher-frequency sounds are overly sharp. The open nature of the design lends everything a pleasing sense of space, and the various elements of a given track generally always sound like they’re in the right place. The design does mean there’s practically zero sub-bass, so you don’t get any of that <em>feel-it-in-your-chest</em> thump from lots of hip-hop or dance tracks, but the upper-bass range that <em>is</em> present has enough juice to keep most songs from sounding too thin.</p><figure><img alt="The Koss KSC75 on-ear headphones." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/47b497b0-5630-11ed-9bdf-91808b662c98" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn/Engadget</div></figure><p>All told, this is an agreeable sound, one that’s ideal for those looking to get into more critical listening. The KSC75 doesn’t go all-in on the bass like many popular headphones these days, and while it’s a pleasure with all types of music, it plays especially nice with folksy rock or richer recordings. Beyond that, its light weight and emphasis on the vocal range makes it a natural option for podcasts and audiobooks. When I’m not in a party chat, it’s also a fine choice for gaming, since its balanced tuning and wide soundstage are ideal for, say, accurately locating other players in an FPS like <em>Overwatch</em> or <em>Halo</em>.</p><p>Now, I don’t want to sound naïve. There’s a perfectly decent amount of detail here, but a good set of modern, higher-end headphones will still pick up more of a track’s nuances. And again, the utter lack of sub-bass should make it a no-go for bassheads.</p><p>Plus, since this design was something of an outlier even in 2005, it forgoes basically all of the conveniences of a modern headphone. There’s no microphone, no built-in controls, and no sweat resistance rating. Because the design is open, it blocks next to no outside noise, and everyone around you will hear whatever you’re listening to if you turn things up to even a moderate volume. None of this is ideal for travel or working out.</p><p>The KSC75’s clip-on shape is light and comfy to my ears, but it won’t be for everyone. (Lots of people buy <a href="https://www.yaxi.jp/onlineshop/">these earpads</a> from Japanese company Yaxi to heighten the comfort, but I wouldn’t say they’re necessary for most.) The build mostly consists of cheap silver plastic, and there are many stories of its non-detachable cable breaking over time. (Though Koss’ <a href="https://koss.com/pages/warranty-repair">lifetime limited warranty</a> effectively lets you replace them ad infinitum for $9 a pop.) These are also wired headphones in a world that is actively eradicating the headphone jack, so if you want to use them on the go, chances are you’ll need a dongle.</p><p>But that $20 price goes a long way. Saying the KSC75 is a great value is practically a meme among audio enthusiasts at this point — not in the “lol funny photo” sense, but in the “symbolic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/26/crosswords/what-is-a-meme.html">idea that spreads</a> and embeds itself within a culture” way. Still, it’s true: the KSC75’s sound quality is practically unmatched in its price range and competitive with many headphones that cost $100 or more. They’ve gotten me through many hours of working from home. If all you want is an affordable headphone that helps you better savor your music, I bet you’ll enjoy them too.</p>

<p>Board games are great gifts for anyone who wants to spend time with friends and family and disconnect from technology. They’re interactive, fun, and you get to tell everyone to put away their phones for a while. But instead of pulling out the same old classics like Monopoly and Scrabble, we recommend giving some new titles a try. Here, we’ve compiled a list of games that you might not have heard of, but will still make excellent gifts this holiday season. From games with swashbuckling pirates to those with haunted mansions, we’re sure at least one of these will be a hit with friends and family.</p><h2>Trekking Through History</h2><figure><img alt="Trekking Through History" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/2fb22db0-5470-11ed-bffe-516c7053e6d0" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Whether your gift recipient is a serious history buff or a more casual one, they’ll find something to like in <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwQjQ0S1g4OEMvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTM0LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MDEyODJjMC00N2EwLTM5MDgtYjUwYy01OGQ0ZGE0YjgyMDcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWzNXY4Ur9BXvLedZC9RPPSkDVTn6CXKLbIfjr7fbnuS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0B44KX88C%2F">Trekking Through History</a>.

Plus, the game can be educational, as players learn a thing or two in the process about bird species, from the burrowing owl to the scissor-tailed flycatcher.</p><a class="athena-button rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwN1lRNjQxTlEvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTM1LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MDEyODJjMC00N2EwLTM5MDgtYjUwYy01OGQ0ZGE0YjgyMDcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAexxiwZ-eWZ7AyPYpdeqpv1Uwgk9kPYBX6HePLQ7NtpB&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07YQ641NQ%2F" id="a3d596f38ebf46ee93d48321561e7718">Buy Wingspan at Amazon - $65</a><p></p>

<p>Well, it finally happened: Elon Musk has officially taken over Twitter. This week, Cherlynn and Devindra are joined by Engadget’s Karissa Bell to discuss how Musk is reshaping the social network. Are all the changes bad, or is there some method to his madness? (Spoiler: It looks more like desperation than anything else.) Also, we dive into some recent Google AI news, and Devindra explains why the new Apple TV 4K is genuinely great.</p><p>Listen below, or subscribe on your podcast app of choice.

<p>I’ve always wanted an Apple TV, but the high price and locked-down features made me opt for Roku’s ecosystem instead. And while I appreciate the freedom Roku offers, Devindra Hardawar’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-review-2022-faster-cheaper-best-streaming-box-150013627.html">review of the new TV 4K</a> almost turned my head.</p><p>The 2022 model is cheaper, smaller and runs more efficiently than its predecessor, and it still packs that fancy Siri remote as standard. The box’s speed is its greatest strength, letting you leap between video streaming apps in the time it takes for your cable box to wake up.</p><p>Of course, there’s always a fly or two in the ointment, like the $129, 64GB model has a compromise or two. If you, for instance, want a built-in Ethernet port, or Thread IoT integration, you’ll need the $149, 128GB model. Never change, Apple.</p><p>– Dan Cooper</p><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/holiday-gifts-best-photography-videography-gear-gifts-140040959.html">The best gifts for photographers in 2022</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smartwatches-153013118.html">The best smartwatches</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-fall-to-new-low-of-145-for-today-only-085343121.html">Beats Fit Pro fall to new low of $145 </a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-device-matter-support-compatibility-141558771.html">Amazon will bring Matter smart home support to 17 Echo devices this year (updated)</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-basic-with-ads-explainer-190555318.html">Here's what you need to know about Netflix's Basic with Ads plan</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-chrome-os-beta-updates-160018804.html">Steam for ChromeOS works on more devices and is easier to install </a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-communities-rollout-group-chats-070030069.html">WhatsApp's new Communities feature aims to bring related group chats together</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-un-carrier-on-smart-suitcase-172947176.html">Hey T-Mobile, nobody wants your suitcase</a></p></li></ul><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-redwire-3d-printing-human-knee-161941443.html">Astronauts will 3D print part of a human knee in space</a></h2><h3>It’s part of a test of a battlefield bioprinter.</h3><p></p><p>It would be great if we could simply 3D-print parts of our bodies that we’ve damaged or worn out through overuse.

## Twitter sued by employees amid mass layoffs

<p>Twitter is facing a class action lawsuit over its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-layoffs-010148183.html">ongoing mass layoffs today</a>, which could likely cut its workforce in half. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-04/twitter-sued-for-mass-layoffs-by-musk-without-enough-notice?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, employees filed a class action lawsuit against the company in San Francisco federal court, arguing that Twitter's actions run afoul of the US Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. Under the labor law, companies with 100 or more employees are required to notify them of mass layoffs 60 days in advance.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/03/technology/twitter-layoffs-elon-musk.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reported earlier that Twitter will begin layoffs on Friday and that around half of the company's staff members will lose their jobs. In an email seen by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/03/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, Twitter said that the layoffs are "unfortunately necessary to ensure the company's success moving forward." The company also told employees to stay at home today and to wait for an email. If they get one in their Twitter account, their job is safe. But if they receive the email in their personal account, that means they're being let go. Some people are reporting on the social network that they already got <a href="https://twitter.com/ruchowdh/status/1588365045158727681">locked out</a> of their work emails and had been <a href="https://twitter.com/SBkcrn/status/1588357614211158018">removed</a> from company Slack.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The plaintiffs are asking the court to issue an order forcing Twitter to obey the WARN Act. They also want the court to prohibit the company from soliciting employees to sign away their right to litigate. Shannon Liss-Riordan, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said they filed the complaint "in an attempt to make sure that employees are aware that they should not sign away their rights and that they have an avenue for pursuing their rights."</p><p>Liss-Riordan was also the lawyer who handled the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-sued-by-ex-employees-who-claim-that-mass-layoffs-violated-federal-law-084508720.html">lawsuit against Tesla</a> in June over layoffs that cut 10 percent of the automaker's workforce. Similar to this complaint, the plaintiffs back then argued that Tesla violated the WARN Act. Company chief Elon Musk, who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html">took over Twitter</a> a week ago, called the lawsuit "trivial" in a talk with <em>Bloomberg</em> Editor-In-Chief John Micklethwait. The court had also sided with the company and ruled that employees should negotiate with Tesla in a closed-door arbitration instead.</p>

## Cherry reboots its coveted '80s keyboard switch

<p>Cherry is releasing the <a href="https://www.cherrymx.de/en/cherry-mx/mx-special/mx-black-clear-top.html">MX Black Clear-Top</a> (aka the "Nixie") a new version of a keyboard switch from the '80s prized for its typing feel and acoustics. It was manufactured for a German company called Nixdorf (hence the nickname) that mainly built keyboards for terminals, servers and mini computers. Because the Nixie was only built for a few years, used switches are rare and command high prices — a fact that no doubt inspired Cherry to start building an updated version.</p><p>The original <a href="https://www.theremingoat.com/blog/from-the-vault-cherry-nixie-review">Nixie switch</a> was a variant of Cherry's MX Black switch with very specific modifications. Namely, the actuating force was bumped slightly from 60 to 63.5 centinewtons, and a diode was integrated into the switch for n-key rollover (NKRO) which allows the keyboard to register every key press, even if done simultaneously.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new version carries the same specs and looks, including "the familiar milky top housing, black bottom housing, and a black stem," Cherry wrote in a press release. It has the same actuation force of 63.5 centinewtons, a pre-travel of 2 mm, and a total travel of 4 mm. The company also retained the same vintage design for the spring.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, though, it's being built using the company's latest production systems so it's up to the quality of its latest MX switches. Cherry will offer the MX Black Clear-Top both with or without grease works, with the latter being for enthusiasts who want to do any lubrication themselves. The switches arrive at the beginning of 2023, but Cherry has yet to announce the price.&nbsp;</p><p></p>

<p>PayPal has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/03/paypal-venmo-apple-tap-to-pay-integration/">revealed</a> in its <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/231198771/files/doc_financials/2022/q3/PYPL-Q3-22-Earnings-Release.pdf">latest earnings report</a> (PDF) that merchant users in the US will be able to accept payments using their iPhones in the near future without the need for dongles and card readers. The payment solution will be integrating Apple's Tay to Pay technology "soon." That means businesses and sellers will easily be able to receive payments made via contactless debit or credit cards, as well as via mobile wallets including Apple Pay, through the PayPal or Venmo app. They simply have to make sure that they're using an iPhone XS or a newer model.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tap-to-pay-iphone-business-163522302.html">announced</a> the Tap to Pay feature on iPhone in February this year. A few months later, staff members at the Apple Park visitor center in Cupertino were seen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-testing-upcoming-tap-to-pay-merchant-payments-at-its-visitor-center-100004402.html">testing</a> the the feature. Since it makes payments as easy as bumping phones together, it seemed like it could be a threat to payment companies like Square. However, Square quickly got on board and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-tap-to-pay-iphone-public-launch-115532796.html">launched Tap to Pay integration</a> in September after running an early access program.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to its Tap to Pay news, PayPal has also revealed that it's adding Apple Pay as a payment option to its checkout solution for merchant platforms. And starting next year, customers in the US will be able to add their PayPal and Venmo credit and debit cards to their Apple Wallets. In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-03/paypal-apple-reach-truce-and-will-accept-each-other-s-products?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, PayPal Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman said the company is "very pleased to be working with Apple to enhance [its] offerings for... PayPal and Venmo merchants and consumers." It's also worth noting that PayPal briefly touched on making Venmo available <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-venmo-payment-option-130142262.html">as a checkout option</a> for some Amazon users in the US in its earnings report. The company reiterated that the feature will roll out to everyone in the country this coming holiday season.&nbsp;</p>

## Combined HBO Max and Discovery+ streaming service launching earlier than expected

<p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) recently announced plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-discovery-earnings-call-second-quarter-010400473.html">combine HBO Max and Discovery+</a> into one streaming service set to debut in the summer of 2023. Now in the company's latest <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4552979-warner-bros-discovery-inc-wbd-q3-2022-earnings-call-transcript">earnings call</a>, WBD President and CEO David Zaslav said the combined service will arrive in the US earlier than expected in spring of 2023.</p><p>The streaming services combined now have 94.9 million subscribers, with the large majority of those from HBO and HBO Max, according to <a href="https://www.fiercevideo.com/video/warner-bros-discovery-nears-95m-streaming-subs-bumps-timeline-combined-streaming-service#:~:text=As%20previously%20mentioned%2C%20the%20yet,Latin%20America%2C%20Europe%20and%20APAC."><em>Fierce Wireless</em></a>. That includes 2.8 million new subscribers, with most of those (2.3 million) coming from overseas markets.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Along with the combined streaming service, WBD plans to launch its own free ad-support streaming TV service (FAST) in 2023. "As the company with the largest TV and film library in the industry... that allows us to distribute our content in multiple ways," said Zaslav. The company also said its investing in content at historic levels, citing the <a href="https://collider.com/henry-cavill-james-gunn-dceu-comments/">hiring</a> of James Gunn and Peter Safran as co-chairmen and CEOs of DC studios.</p><p>It's still not clear what form the combined streaming service will take or what it will be called. However, WBD recently started transferring Discovery+ content to HBO Max like <em>Fixer Upper: The Castle,</em> and it's became a top five show in just a few days, Zaslav said.&nbsp;</p>

## The Hulu + Live TV bundle will cost at least $5 more starting in December

<p>Like many <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-price-us-increase-canada-203548569.html">other streaming services</a> over the past year, Hulu <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/10/hulu-raises-its-subscription-prices-today/">raised</a> its subscription prices in October from $7 to $8 per month for its ad-supported tier. Now, the Disney-owned streaming service is also raising the prices for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hulu-live-tv-is-20-off-for-three-months-for-new-and-returning-subscribers-124054472.html">Hulu + Live TV</a> bundle. In an email sent to an <em>Engadget</em> editor, it said that the Hulu + Live TV (with ads), Disney+ (no ads) and ESPN+ (with ads) bundle will cost $75 per month on their first billing cycle after December 8th. That's $5 more than the current monthly price of $70.&nbsp;</p><p>Our editor also got a note that they can switch or cancel their subscription. But the legacy plan they're subscribed to will no longer be available after December 8th, so they won't be able to switch back afterward. To note, according to <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/11/03/hulu-set-to-hike-prices-for-hulu-live-tv-bundle-in-december"><em>Apple Insider</em></a>, those paying for a bundle wherein Hulu has no ads will have to pony up $83 a month starting on December 8th instead of $76 like what they're currently paying.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Seeing as Disney <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-price-increase-ad-based-service-204903273.html">announced in August</a> that Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+ are all raising their prices, perhaps it doesn't come as a surprise that the Live TV bundle is getting a price hike, as well. Back then, Disney revealed that it incurred operating losses worth nearly $1.1 billion from running its streaming services. It also said that the third quarter of the year added 14.4 million subscribers to Disney+ alone, and the company is clearly hoping to earn some of the money it lost but charging its viewers more.&nbsp;</p>

The move happens less than a month after Disney went dark on Sling TV for two days, with the streaming service saying that Disney wanted $1 billion more to extend its carriage contract.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sling TV launched in 2015 at a $20 per month price tag, but that price has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-28-sling-tv-a-la-carte-channels-and-free-shows.html">gradually gone up</a> and now sits at double the original rate. It's still one of the cheaper live TV streaming options, though, as YouTube TV costs $65 per month (up nearly double its original $35 price), and DirecTV runs $70, minimum.&nbsp;</p><p>Schanman said that Sling TV has new features coming down the road, "including plans to add 150-plus new channels through 2023, new user profiles for your household and auto binge watching capabilities."</p>

## Twitter warns employees that layoffs are happening Friday

<p>Twitter will reportedly begin laying off workers on Friday, only a week after Elon Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html">officially took control</a> of the website. Around half of the company's staff members will lose their jobs, according to internal messages seen by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/03/technology/twitter-layoffs-elon-musk.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/03/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>. That's consistent with the previous reports that came out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-50-percent-layoffs-031228046.html">earlier this week</a>.</p><p>Musk didn't waste much time in making personnel changes after taking over Twitter. His first act was to dismiss then-CEO Parag Agrawal and other members of the leadership team. Several other executives have left the company over the last week. In an email sent to staff members, Twitter said that it has to "go through the difficult process of reducing [its] global workforce on Friday" and that the move "is unfortunately necessary to ensure the company's success moving forward."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Twitter's offices will be closed on Friday, and all employees are asked to stay home and wait for an update regarding their fate. Those who get to keep their jobs will receive an email with the subject line "Your Role at Twitter" via their work emails. Twitter will contact people getting laid off through their personal emails with the next steps to take.</p><p>Since Twitter is now a privately held entity, it doesn't ostensibly have to answer to shareholders anymore. However, the company still needs to improve the bottom line. It's <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/01/elon-musk-twitter-verification-stephen-king/">on the hook</a> for roughly $1 billion a year in interest payments on the debt Musk saddled the company with when he bought it. In the three months to June 30th, Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-second-quarter-2022-121851341.html">posted a net loss</a> of $270 million. So, it needs to make more money and/or reduce costs, and to do so pretty swiftly.</p><p>Some major advertisers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-suspends-advertising-on-twitter-090026887.html">are skittish</a> about the new regime and Twitter is trying to diversify its sources of revenue. Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-price-increasing-8-per-month-180319987.html">plans to charge $8 per month for Twitter Blue</a>, which verified users will need to pay for to retain their blue checkmark. The service will offer new features, according to Musk, with subscribers seeing fewer ads and the ability to include longer videos in tweets. Reports suggest the Twitter Blue may go up from $5 to $8 per month as soon as Monday. The company is also reportedly working on a plan to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/01/elon-musk-twitter-paywalled-video/">offer paid video posts</a>, which it may use to monetize adult content.</p><p><em>Mariella Moon contributed to this report.</em></p>
