<p>Midfielder has an all-round game of passing and pressing that has made him invaluable since signing from Juventus</p><p>Rodrigo Bentancur was four years old when his mother died. It is why he wears the No 30 shirt, commemorating the date of her birthday. When he was 13, he left his small town in Uruguay to live at the Boca Juniors academy in Buenos Aires. When he was 19, he had the chance to move to Europe, a decision that terrified him. “When they talked about the possibility of coming to Juventus, I panicked,” he would later remember. “I was very happy, but also very scared.”</p><p>The point of dredging all this up now is that when you have overcome challenges of this magnitude, perhaps you become more relaxed about the prospect of being outnumbered three on two in midfield. Life taught Bentancur to grow up fast, that the only real defence against adversity is fearlessness. This may well explain his unusual maturity on the pitch, the tenacity that has made him one of the most impressive midfielders in the Premier League and – with apologies to Harry Kane – probably Tottenham’s best player this season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/04/fearless-rodrigo-bentancur-keeps-tottenham-ticking-under-pressure">Continue reading...</a>

## The US is on a knife-edge. The enemy for Trump’s Republicans is democracy itself | Jonathan Freedland

<p>Most candidates from the GOP in these midterm elections refuse democracy’s most basic tenet: accepting the voters’ verdict</p><p>As in all the best horror movies, at first glance everything looks normal. It’s a classic scene of the American autumn: campaign rallies outside community centres, battle buses emblazoned with candidates’ smiling faces, kids wearing badges and holding up signs, while TV screens fill with debates, punditry and an endless loop of focus-grouped ads. Even the predicted outcome of Tuesday’s US midterm elections fits a template as familiar as falling leaves. Most experts agree that the Democrats will take a hit, losing control of at least one or perhaps both chambers of Congress, because they are the incumbent party – and incumbent parties almost always suffer in midterm – and because times are unusually tough. Inflation, interest rates, petrol prices, fear of crime: they’re all up. Couple that with a president set to turn 80 this month whose approval ratings have often plumbed the depths, and all the elements are in place for the Democrats to take a midterm beating, losing ground even in states they once counted as solidly their own.</p><p>But look closer and you see something else. Because next week’s results will decide more than just whether the red team or the blue team takes control of the House of Representatives and the Senate, on which hangs Joe Biden’s ability to get things done. Next week’s elections will also help determine whether, and for how much longer, the US will remain a genuine democracy.</p><p>Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist.

<p>Liverpool midfielder on 20 years since his Leeds debut at 16 and his constant battle to stay competitive as he nears 600 league games</p><p>As a single-minded 36-year-old sportsman “just trying to keep going” at the highest level, James Milner has little time for reminiscing. With a momentous milestone on the horizon, however, he has no alternative. On Thursday the Liverpool midfielder will celebrate the 20th anniversary of his Premier League debut. Perhaps with a yoga session at home after training, though certainly not with an alcoholic drink.</p><p>It was at Upton Park on 10 November 2002 where Terry Venables launched the top-flight career of a 16-year-old Milner, bringing him on as an 84th-minute substitute for Jason Wilcox in Leeds’ 4-3 win over West Ham. For perspective, Wilcox is 51 and academy director at Manchester City. Nigel Martyn was on the Leeds bench and was the same age as Milner is now. The veteran goalkeeper took the Premier League’s then second-youngest debutant aside and urged him to savour every moment of a career that would flash by “like lightning”. Three Premier League, one Champions League, two FA Cup and two League Cup winners’ medals later, the conversation still resonates.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/04/james-milner-liverpool-20-years-since-leeds-debut">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Women withholding sex as a political tactic is part of the bigger picture of women’s rights and bodily autonomy, says cultural critic and classicist Helen Morales</p><p>Last month, the German chapter of animal-rights charity Peta called on women to <a href="https://www.peta.org/blog/strike-on-sex-with-meat-eating-men/" title="">refrain from sex with “meat-eating men</a>”. Sex strikes have their roots in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/sep/10/theatre.classics" title="">an ancient Greek play, Lysistrata</a>, where women from both sides of a war withhold sex in dissent – but as a modern tool of protest, do they work? I asked cultural critic and classicist Helen Morales.</p><p><strong>I laughed when I heard about the </strong><strong>Peta strike. I suppose you could say I’m on a lifelong sex strike from climate deniers and anti-abortionists. Isn’t that just called “not sleeping with people you don’t like”?</strong><br />Or “lifelong marriage”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/04/do-sex-strikes-ever-work-we-ask-an-expert">Continue reading...</a>

## Lee Jung-jae: ‘Squid Game made me rethink how I look at the world’

<p>The dystopian TV drama made the South Korean actor go global and won him an Emmy. Now he’s written and directed his own espionage action thriller</p><p>The night before we meet in a central London hotel suite, Lee Jung-jae sat on a stage at a West End cinema, apologising profusely to the assembled audience. At a star-studded opening gala of the London East Asian film festival, Lee’s latest project, Hunt<em> – </em>an action-packed, OTT political conspiracy thriller set in 1980s Korea – had just been screened. But while the crowd whooped and cheered this hero of both the Korean small and silver screen, Lee had something else on his mind. “There is one important subtitle that is slightly wrong in the film,” he lamented, via an interpreter. “It read ‘keep my eyes on you’, when it should have been ‘watch over you’. The meaning was the same, but the nuance wasn’t quite right. And I’m truly sorry.”</p><p>Needless to say, amid the stream of explosions, shootouts and mysterious murders – a full-throttle two hours of twist and turns – few would have noticed this small subtitling snafu. So it’s testament to the weight of responsibility Lee feels in releasing Hunt, a film he has written, directed and starred in, that he opted to raise it immediately. Despite 30 years of industry experience in South Korea, where he is one of the country’s most recognised actors, Lee is making his directorial debut with Hunt. And with his lead role in Netflix’s smash-hit series Squid Game having catapulted the 49-year-old to global stardom, the world’s eyes are on him. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/04/lee-jung-jae-squid-game-hunt-south-korea">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Far from being ‘invaders’, Albanians in Britain have torn themselves from their families and are contributing to UK society</p><p>When I was growing up in Albania in the 1990s, the father of one of my friends was a people smuggler. We used to call him B the Lame. B the Lame had not always been a smuggler. Before the country transitioned from a communist state to a liberal one, he worked shifts in the dockyard, where he would make fishing nets and repaint boats.</p><p>He did not look like a smuggler – he was tiny and anaemic and walked with a limp. He did not choose to be a smuggler – the privatisation reforms that accompanied the arrival of political pluralism forced dockyard managers to make redundancies, so B and his wife found themselves unemployed. Nor did he think of himself as a smuggler: it was a job like any other. He was paid to help people on dinghies reach Italy, and he needed the money to feed his children. He was a little afraid, but not ashamed of his activity. For decades, Albanians had been murdered by their state whenever they tried crossing the border. In the very rare cases in which people succeeded, relatives left behind were deported. Finally, Albanians were free, and B the Lame was helping them realise their dreams. He spoke of this with a touch of pride.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/04/albanians-scapegoats-britain-failing-ideological-project-invaders">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Home, Manchester<br /></strong>Javaad Alipoor’s meditation on the grim fate of Iranian singer Fereydoun Farrokhzad develops into a thrilling investigation of the internet </p><p>You may not have heard of Fereydoun Farrokhzad, the figure at the centre of Javaad Alipoor’s new production. Before I read about the show, neither had I. As I write this review, perhaps I do some research. Maybe I Google Farrokhzad’s name, read his Wikipedia page. Maybe I feel, having done this, as though I know something about him. But, as Alipoor brilliantly demonstrates, knowledge is not the same as understanding.</p><p>Farrokhzad, Alipoor tells us, was like the Iranian Tom Jones: a 1970s pop star and cultural icon. Except he wasn’t really like Tom Jones at all and the fact that Alipoor needs to make this comparison tells us something about who is rendered visible and who exists in the gaps. Alipoor’s show is, on one level, about the unsolved murder of Farrokhzad, who was found brutally killed in his flat in 1992 while living as a refugee in Germany. But it’s also about the impossibility of translation, the reproduction of colonial structures, and the way the internet shapes our sense of knowing.</p><p>At <a href="https://homemcr.org/production/things-hidden-since-the-foundation-of-the-world/">Home, Manchester</a>, until 5 November.

When Liz Truss was prime minister, he was chief secretary to the Treasury, but he was demoted by Rishi Sunak.</p><p>In his interview with BBC Breakfast, Philp was asked about his previous job, and whether he would apologise for his role in the disastrous mini-budget. He declined. But he also implied that Truss herself, rather than Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor, was primarily to blame for what happened. He told the programme:</p><p>The decisions around the mini-budget were taken principally by the then-prime minister and to a lesser extent the then-chancellor.</p><p>In the meetings I was in, they were very much superior, the Treasury, they were the numbers people, they were the details people, and they indulged, they humoured the prime minister. I don’t know whether they ran rings around him; they were very rude and the special advisers were very rude and they didn’t give him any deference or respect.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/nov/04/brexit-interest-rates-rishi-sunak-immigration-uk-economy-uk-politics-live-news">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It was the moment when folk and rock collided and Dylan was called ‘Judas’. Ahead of her show at the Royal Albert Hall, Chan Marshall, AKA Cat Power, explains the uncanny ways the musician has shaped her life</p><p>Recently, Chan Marshall was driving to a rehearsal studio in Los Angeles. It was days before she was heading to Europe for a run of dates that includes a night at the Royal Albert Hall, recreating Bob Dylan’s infamous 1966 show: the one where he played electric and a crowd member yelled: “Judas!” As she drove, she listened to the setlist: Visions of Johanna, It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue, Desolation Row.</p><p>Close to the studio, Marshall – AKA Cat Power – glanced in her rear-view mirror and saw her ex-boyfriend in the same line of traffic. “A lane over, two or three cars back, in a fancy car, on his phone,” she says now. It was years since their acrimonious breakup and she had long felt an absence of closure. That day, though, driving in the sunshine, listening to Dylan, she was struck by how little animosity she felt. “I had love and kindness in my heart for this person, which is a really good feeling to have after so long carrying around this ugly shit.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/04/my-heart-is-racing-im-terrified-cat-power-on-recreating-bob-dylans-infamous-1966-electric-gig">Continue reading...</a>

Simmons, the UK’s ambassador to Ukraine, went to the shelter of her residence, as cruise missiles hit the capital and other cities. “My hands were shaking. It was the adrenaline,” she recounts.

By the time I’d finished they had stopped shaking,” she says.</p><p>Since Vladimir Putin’s “murderous invasion” in February – her blunt words – the ambassador has taken cover on various occasions. She points out that her situation is no different from that of millions of Ukrainians, who are now enduring daily power cuts and life by candlelight as a consequence of the Kremlin’s cynical attacks.

You “enter a world”, <a href="https://www.whec.com/national-world/qa-james-cameron-on-the-return-of-avatar/">said</a> Cameron. “You become fully immersed in it.

<p>A widow finds herself in a sinister care home, in this meditation on ageing, trauma and identity from the author behind I’m Thinking of Ending Things</p><p>Recently widowed, Penny is now living alone in the apartment she shared with her husband for many years. Her days seem longer than before, and her memory is not as reliable as it used to be. Her apartment, so familiar, seems alive with strange presences and Penny gradually becomes convinced that someone is watching her.</p><p>While trying to change a lightbulb, she falls and injures herself. As she regains consciousness, she discovers that arrangements have been made for her to enter a private care facility, Six Cedars. When she tries to protest, she is informed that she agreed to the move years ago. The care home is miles from the city, surrounded by thick forest. After some initial misgivings, Penny begins to feel that her new situation might have its benefits: she has escaped her loneliness, and has people of her own age to talk to. But why are there only three other residents? Six Cedars’s manager Shelley claims that her background in science enables her to provide the most advanced standard of care for older people. Her compassion seems genuine, but though it frightens her to admit it, Penny increasingly suspects that Shelley’s motives may be darker than they appear.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/04/we-spread-by-iain-reid-review-a-fine-piece-of-weird-fiction">Continue reading...</a>

The Afropop juggernaut soundtracked my university years, yet I’m struck by how youthful he appears, apparently having barely aged since I screamed myself hoarse watching him perform at London’s Hammersmith Apollo a decade ago.</p><p>The only difference is that now, the 32-year-old Nigerian musician’s wrists are weighed down by Van Cleef bracelets and a diamond-encrusted watch. And his music is no longer the preserve of a smattering of fans across the diaspora. Wizkid, born Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun, is slouched in an office chair, zen but visibly sapped from a day of interviews, a new album release and recently welcoming a second child with his manager and partner, Jada Pollock. They met in 2012; he has four children altogether. “Now I’m more careful with what I put in my songs,” he says with a laugh. “Because my kids listen to my songs.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/04/afropop-star-wizkid-on-ego-alter-egos-and-elections-i-make-a-lot-of-club-records-but-i-feel-like-a-pastor">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang faces Arsenal, late England auditions and Ralph Hasenhüttl again staring down the barrel</p><p>An already-spicy encounter between Chelsea and Arsenal has been lent added piquancy by a promo clip recorded for BT Sport by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. “It’s nothing personal, Arsenal,” says the Chelsea striker, who is presumably eager to put one over on a club whose manager relieved him of the captaincy before shipping him off to Barcelona. “I’m back, I’m ready and I’m blue.” The striker’s harmless goading might carry more weight if he was currently firing on all cylinders but his return for Chelsea of three goals in 11 appearances – two of them off the bench – is hardly prolific. Aubameyang will be desperate to add to this tally on Sunday and should he do so, any celebration (or the lack thereof) will be scrutinised to within an inch of its life.
