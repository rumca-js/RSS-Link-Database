Even the predicted outcome of Tuesday\u2019s US midterm elections fits a template as familiar as falling leaves. Most experts agree that the Democrats will take a hit, losing control of at least one or perhaps both chambers of Congress, because they are the incumbent party \u2013 and incumbent parties almost always suffer in midterm \u2013 and because times are unusually tough. Inflation, interest rates, petrol prices, fear of crime: they\u2019re all up. Couple that with a president set to turn 80 this month whose approval ratings have often plumbed the depths, and all the elements are in place for the Democrats to take a midterm beating, losing ground even in states they once counted as solidly their own.</p><p>But look closer and you see something else. Because next week\u2019s results will decide more than just whether the red team or the blue team takes control of the House of Representatives and the Senate, on which hangs Joe Biden\u2019s ability to get things done. Next week\u2019s elections will also help determine whether, and for how much longer, the US will remain a genuine democracy.</p><p>Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist.

At a star-studded opening gala of the London East Asian film festival, Lee\u2019s latest project, Hunt<em> \u2013 </em>an action-packed, OTT political conspiracy thriller set in 1980s Korea \u2013 had just been screened. But while the crowd whooped and cheered this hero of both the Korean small and silver screen, Lee had something else on his mind. \u201cThere is one important subtitle that is slightly wrong in the film,\u201d he lamented, via an interpreter. \u201cIt read \u2018keep my eyes on you\u2019, when it should have been \u2018watch over you\u2019.

Despite 30 years of industry experience in South Korea, where he is one of the country\u2019s most recognised actors, Lee is making his directorial debut with Hunt. And with his lead role in Netflix\u2019s smash-hit series Squid Game having catapulted the 49-year-old to global stardom, the world\u2019s eyes are on him. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/04/lee-jung-jae-squid-game-hunt-south-korea\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/04/i-think-my-friends-husband-is-emotionally-abusing-her-should-i-talk-to-her-about-it", "title": "I think my friend is a victim of domestic abuse.
