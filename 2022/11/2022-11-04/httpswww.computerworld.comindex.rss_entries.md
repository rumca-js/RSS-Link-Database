<p>After worker productivity climbed to near-record levels during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic and the reslting shift to hybrid and remote work, it fell hard in the first half of 2022 — leaving experts to scratch their heads as to why.</p><p>On Thursday, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/prod2.nr0.htm" rel="nofollow">released third-quarter data</a> showing business productivity had increased marginally — up just 0.3% from the previous quarter -- and worker output had risen a paltry  2.8%.

And that means it isn't especially optimal for intricate, extended interactions revolving around touch (unless you're a Tinkerbell-sized creature with teensy fingies, in which case the Pixel Watch is probably bigger than your entire being — so, yeah, good luck with that).</p><p>It seems like the understatement of the century, I realize. And yet, device-maker after device-maker continues to emphasize those very sorts of painfully awkward touch-based interactions and app-centric experiences with the smartwatch form.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3678728/pixel-watch-voice-commands.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
