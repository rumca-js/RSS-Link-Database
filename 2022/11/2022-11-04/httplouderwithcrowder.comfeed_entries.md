They had one job and that was to save Democrats. They did everything they were told to do by repeating the words "January," "abortion," and "sixth" over and over and over again. Yet it's sinking in that it was all for naught and there is going to be many a hurt butt in the studio on Tuesday night. I'm not sure what stage of grief <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tim-scott-joy-reid-response" target="_blank">Joy Reid</a> is at. But this is one of the dumbest f*cking things I ever heard.</p><p>Voters only care about <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nancy-pelosi-inflation-crime" target="_blank">inflation</a> because Republicans taught us the word.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Joy Reid: Inflation was never part of the ‚Äúnormal lexicon‚Äù until Republicans ‚Äútaught people the word‚Äù <a href="https://t.co/GV8wlHjMK8">pic.twitter.com/GV8wlHjMK8</a><br />‚Äî End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) <a href="https://twitter.com/EndWokeness/status/1588586215565328385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>I mean...</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">NBC News will forever be sullied as long as this dope is employed by them.<br /><br />But then again...Al Sharpton, Ben Collins, etc. <a href="https://t.co/MXY2gUZE31">https://t.co/MXY2gUZE31</a><br />‚Äî Nathan Wurtzel (@NathanWurtzel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NathanWurtzel/status/1588587285884305411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Let's set aside that everyone knows the word inflation. They may not calculate formulas or have economic degrees. But they know inflation makes the costs of goods and services go up, and when that happens it make if difficult to provide for their families. And when THAT happens, people lose their jobs in government.</p><p>Take Joy Reid for her word that normal people don't use the word inflation while they are talking at home. Do you know another word they don't use at home? "Abortion." They also don't use the words "January" and "Sixth" unless it's someone's birthday. </p><p>Voters only "know" those words because democrats "taught" them those words. Or, attempted to teach them those words and sucked at it. That's why Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) are having panic attacks.</p><p>Republicans "taught" voters inflation and crime. Democrats "taught" voters abortion and January 6th. Not to tempt the wrath of the whatever from high atop the thing, but one side was clearly more effective at it.</p><p><p>

</p>
<p>Kari Lake is referencing a popular criticism on the right where conservatives will imply, without evidence, that Hillary Clinton likes to have people who cross her murdered. Or, to be more precise with my language, "suicided." It is quite common whenever someone famous dies for some prankster to put out a tweet that they had information that would lead to the arrest of Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Implying that, because of that information, they are no longer alive,</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>The idea rose to prominence when former <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jeffrey-epstein-bill-clinton-girls" target="_blank">Clinton confidant</a> and convicted pedo <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jeffrey-epstein-bill-clinton-back-rub" target="_blank">Jeffrey Epstein</a> was found dead in his jail cell of an apparent "suicide," and the internet when crazy with "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/another-top-10-epstein-didnt-kill-himself-meme-roundup" target="_blank">Epstein Didn't Kill Himself</a>" memes. It was a great moment of time on the internet, only rivaled by the F*ck Joe Biden/Let's Go Brandon era. The implication was that IF Epstein didn't kill himself, perhaps one of his powerful friends who he was a confidant of wanted him out of the way.</p><p>But, as I said, there is no evidence Hillary does any of these things. Kari Lake has nothing to worry about.</p><p><p><em><strong>Need a quick laugh?</strong> Check out and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMAtX9eFBpwc4LtgvbqsOpQ?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">subscribe to our CrowderBits YouTube channel</a> for Louder with Crowder skits, opens, and parody videos!</em></p></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

	There are few people on the non-leftist side of the internet having more fun than Tim Pool. Sure, 
	<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tim-pool-swatted-again" target="_blank">constantly being swatted</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tim-pool-credible-evacuation" target="_blank">having people looking to murderize you</a> could grow tiresome. But the dude podcasts. He skates. And he makes music that is a) not country, and b) rocks pretty hard.
</p><p>
	Pool dropped his latest single, <em>Genocide (Losing My Mind)</em>. See how many "cameos" you can spot in the video.

</p><p>
	The cameos are, of course, fakes. Obvious fakes. The kind of fakes there are apps that let you make them on your phone. Hilarious fakes mocking a who's who of people we don't like. The kind of fakes that you would have to be an unmitigated nincompoop to not realize they are fakes, Though, 
	<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tim-pool-wapo-billboard" target="_blank">I can think of one person who might not appreciate the way she is portrayed, and slam a video mocking the fake news media as "fake news."</a> But normies will have a sense of humor about it.

## Elon Musk discovers what happens when you appease leftist activists, tweets anger over Twitter's revenue drop

He has made no changes. Yet, leftwing activists have launched a campaign via their shadow dark money groups to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/general-mills-audi-and-pfizer-join-growing-list-of-companies-pausing-twitter-ads-11667507765" target="_blank">get advertisers to pull ads from Twitter</a> unless Musk bends the knee and agrees to censor whatever they want him to censor. Even though Elon invited them over for lunch and told them they were pretty.</p><p>Musk, for some reason, seems surprised by this. <em>"Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists."</em></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists.<br /><br />Extremely messed up!

<p>I'm surprised he's surprised.

He knows this. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-responds-bill-gates" target="_blank">He even has one of their top benefactors on speed dial</a>. </p><p>It's not about fairness. It's about left-wing progressives seeing a single Big Tech platform they can't control the flow of information on and looking to have it destroyed. One would think someone as smart as Elon Musk would have realized this by now. They've been attempting to destroy him ever since he said "so, I think I'll buy Twitter."<br /></p><p>If Elon is really this surprised, perhaps he isn't as smart as advertised. Or he'll bend the knee. </p><p><p>

Crime-denier Gov. Kathy Hochul calls New Yorkers' concern about crime a conspiracy. She needs Hillary Clinton (and Bill Clinton, and Kamala, and the Bidens) to swoop in and try and save her. Also, a NYC man with twenty-five priors was arrested for sexually assaulting a jogger. </p><p>Hochul, a crime-denier who <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kathy-hochul-locking-up-criminals" target="_blank">doesn't understand why it is so important to lock up criminals</a>, accused Republicans of <a href="https://freebeacon.com/democrats/kathy-hochul-republicans-have-conspiracy-to-make-americans-feel-unsafe-in-dem-cities/" target="_blank">creating a "conspiracy"</a> to make people feel unsafe in Democrat-run cities. Also known as, cities. Hochul is grossly <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/new-york-governor-2022" target="_blank">underperforming the crime-ridden NYC's</a> early vote count, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/politics/hillary-clinton-new-york-governor-hochul-2022-midterms/index.html" target="_blank">so she needs to called in Democrats</a> to save her. One of them is two-time failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Hillary is going viral for this clip:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Hillary Clinton: "The states with the highest crime levels are states run by Republicans. That's just a fact." <a href="https://t.co/sv6XQ72FbC">pic.twitter.com/sv6XQ72FbC</a><br />‚Äî Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1588155329711411200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>It is a fact that, indexed for population, Democrat-led-cities are top of the charts with crime and some of those Democrat run-cites are in a state with a Republican governor. Overall, New York City remains the pound-for-pound champion.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Ahem <a href="https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@HillaryClinton</a> <a href="https://t.co/JW95iaqe4q">pic.twitter.com/JW95iaqe4q</a><br />‚Äî Theüê∞FOO (@PolitiBunny) <a href="https://twitter.com/PolitiBunny/status/1588317047145914368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>To help illustrate that point, let's meet Carl Phanor.</p><p>Mr. Phanor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/nyc-homeless-man-arrested-joggers-sexual-assault-alleged-serial-rapist-25-priors" target="_blank">was arrested on Thursday</a> for predatory sexual assault, criminal sex act, strangulation, robbery, and grand larceny. Why, yes! He does have an alarming list of priors! However did you guess?</p><blockquote>Phanor was wanted by the NYPD in at least two other sexual assaults.<br /><br />Aside from the three sexual assaults, Phanor has been arrested at least 25 other times for crimes ranging from petit larceny to drug possession.<br /></blockquote><p>That is a LOT of crime for Kathy Hochul to deny, and it's just one man.</p><p>The embattled Democrat governor is set to campaign with former President Bill Clinton and current President Pudding Head this weekend. Instead of campaigning in a battleground during the final 72 hours before election day, the current and former democrat president are needed to "save" New York.</p><p>Her opponent Congressman Lee Zeldin is running to save New York (no-finger quotes). He'll be campaigning throughout the state while Gov. Hochul stays in Manhattan.</p><p><p>
