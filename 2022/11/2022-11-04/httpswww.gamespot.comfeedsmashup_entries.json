Andor is heading toward Rogue One and Cassian Andor's decision to give it all for the Rebellion, but there's still more to do, including heading to an iconic Star Wars location, creator Tony Gilroy told <a href=\"https://collider.com/andor-season-2-yavin-tony-gilroy-comments/\">Collider</a>.</p><p>Gilroy said that for Andor Season 2, he's bringing back Beau Willimon and brother Dan Gilroy as writers, and that they'll be joined by Tom Bissell (Lead writer on <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/gears-of-war-4-review/1900-6416538/\">Gears of War 4</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/gears-5-review/1900-6417287/\">Gears of War 5</a>) as well. </p><p>\"Tom Bissell is really cool and a really, really interesting, versatile, really good writer,\" Gilroy said before revealing where <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diego-luna-explains-why-andor-is-the-real-shoots-first-guy-in-star-wars/1100-6507759/\">Andor</a> will head next. \"[He's] also a very, very, very big Star Wars fan, which we really wanted to make sure we had another pro because we're going into Rogue [One], and we're going to Yavin, and then we're going into places that we eventually need to really weave our way back to the source. So Tom came in and he's been great; so he's got some episodes, too.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/andor-season-2-will-head-to-yavin-creator-says/1100-6508936/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-catalyst-chaotically-upends-battle-royale-doors/1100-6508935/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Apex Legends' Catalyst Chaotically Upends The Battle Royale's Most Consistent Element: Doors", "date_published": "2022-11-04 21:41:00+00:00", "description": "<p>I love <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/catalyst-guide-apex-legends/1100-6508542/\">Catalyst</a> a lot, and it very well could be the recency bias talking, but she's my favorite of the new playable characters added to <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/\">Apex Legends</a> during the battle royale's fourth year.

But none of that matters when Catalyst plays a lot like the legends added in Year 3, all of whom <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-year-3-was-a-celebration-of-titanfall-2s-legacy/1100-6500430/\">celebrate the best part of Titanfall 2's legacy</a>: A first-person shooter doesn't have to make practical sense to be a whole lot of chaotic and joyful fun.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Added in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-15-start-date-patch-notes-catalyst-and-everything-we-know/1100-6508308/\">Apex Legends Season 15</a>, Catalyst doesn't have especially powerful abilities, but they certainly seem so with all the visual flair assigned to her kit. And all those flashy skills have one thing in common: They allow Catalyst to be an absolute menace when it comes to opening and closing doors. This may seem dumb and unimportant, and if Catalyst were a playable character in any other hero shooter, it probably would be. But Apex Legends is different--it has the best door technology I've ever seen in any video game to date. Adding a character who can mess with a system that's that consistent has a lot of fun potential.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To better understand what I mean, let's talk about Apex Legends' doors for a second. I want you to think about doors in video games. How do most of them work? Honestly, they don't. There are a lot of doors that simply signify the moment when the game takes control away from you and sees you move to the next area via a short cutscene, some are a loading screen between areas, or they're not even there and the game uses empty entryways. In the cases where doors are allowed to be doors, there are usually only two states to the door--open or closed--and the door cannot be interacted with beyond moving it between those two states.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-catalyst-chaotically-upends-battle-royale-doors/1100-6508935/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/infinity-ward-fixes-modern-warfare-2-vault-edition-confusion-gamespot-news/2300-6459929/", "title": "Infinity Ward Fixes Modern Warfare 2 Vault Edition Confusion | GameSpot News", "date_published": "2022-11-04 21:20:00+00:00", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1574/15746725/4059104-20221104_modernwarfareiivaultedition_newsv2.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> MW2 Vault Edition players get a bonus, Marvel Snap will let you play with friends, and Final Fantasy XVI is almost finished.", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-bayonetta-3-and-this-collectors-box-at-a-discount/1100-6508869/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Grab Bayonetta 3 And This Collector's Box At A Discount", "date_published": "2022-11-04 20:58:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Bayonetta 3 has emerged as one of the must-have games on the Nintendo Switch this year, and if you're looking to grab a copy with a few bonus items at a reduced price, you're in luck.

Every year TV shows we love get canceled or come to an end, either after long and successful runs or before they had a chance to catch on with a wider audience. Then again, there are also shows that just aren't very good or managed to escape being noticed at all because of the crowded streaming landscape.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Whatever the case, 2022 is no different. Already, we've seen so many shows get the ax, pointing to what will likely be a very busy year on the cutting room floor. After all, there are more streaming services than ever, and they're all trying their hand at original programming. So even some of the most hyped shows aren't making it beyond their initial seasons. Who can forget that both Cowboy Bebop and Y: The Last Man were canceled fairly quickly after their respective premieres?</p><p>Are your favorite shows safe? What's been canceled so far? And, honestly, is any TV show safe? Those are the questions we're trying to answer. Take a look below at every single TV show that's been canceled so far in 2022. And while we're at it, make sure to check out the surprising number of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/a-look-at-every-tv-show-canceled-in-2021/2900-3701/\">shows that got canned in 2021</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1.

But don't worry, as we'll tell you what you'll need to do to bring the love of Ariel's life to your valley.</p><h2>How to unlock Prince Eric</h2><p>To unlock Prince Eric, you'll first need to have unlocked Ariel and Ursula during your time reviving the valley, which should come naturally as you follow the game's main quests. Once Ariel reaches level 3, she'll mention that she's been unable to locate Eric, sending you on a series of quests to figure out why. However, you won't be able to get a conclusion to this winding endeavor until you've gotten both her and Ursula's friendship levels maxed out.</p><h3>Get Ariel and Ursula to friendship level 10</h3><p>Since both Ariel and Ursula spend their time in the water, leveling them can be a little bit more challenging than it is for characters who can accompany you for tasks. Because of this, your best option for getting them leveled up is to give them their favorite gifts when possible, then load up on picked flowers and hand them in as gifts repeatedly to slowly but surely raise their friendship XP. <strong>Be sure to knock out any quests they offer along the way because you'll need to have those finished before you can get started on unlocking Prince Eric.</strong></p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-how-to-unlock-prince-eric/1100-6508918/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-where-to-talk-to-characters-and-deliver-the-heralds-warning/1100-6508917/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Fortnite: Where To Talk To Characters And Deliver The Herald's Warning", "date_published": "2022-11-04 16:29:00+00:00", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/\">Fortnite</a> Season 3 Chapter 4 has been teasing the arrival of The Herald skin for a while now, and it's finally in-game for you to unlock.

The Ratchet &amp; Clank series might be best known for its combat, with a huge array of creative weaponry. From turning your victims to sheep to making them dance uncontrollably, Insomniac has found some truly creative ways to dispatch your foes.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Ratchet &amp; Clank series is 20 years old today, November 4. To celebrate two decades worth of exploding, sheepinating, pixelizing, and groovitroning your enemies, we've compiled a list of our favorite weapons from the series' history. In no particular order (except for our last pick, which is the best) here are the absolute best weapons in Ratchet &amp; Clank.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Doom Blades</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4058161-doomblades.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The Buzz Blades and their upgraded form, the Doom Blades, are a remarkably efficient way to clear any room. Combat in Ratchet games tends to take place in relatively contained and closed arenas, which makes it extra helpful to have a projectile that ricochets off walls. When the Doom Blades upgrade, your enemies keep taking damage after they've been hit, letting you fling a bunch of bouncing blades into a room and watch the carnage.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bee Mine Glove</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4058162-beemine.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">A great concept made even greater thanks to a spectacular pun, the Bee Mine Glove does exactly what it sounds like it should: releases swarms of angry bees at your enemies. While it also has defensive capabilities and can open chests for you, the main utility is taking down enemies with the power of nature's acupuncturists. With the Bee Mine Glove, you too can reenact the traumatic ending of My Girl on hapless aliens.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Glove of Doom</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4058163-gloveofdoom.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The Glove of Doom is another set-it-and-forget-it weapon, the kind that Ratchet does so well. This one shoots out DoomEggs, little pods that hatch metallic monsters that then chase down your enemy and explode when they get into proximity. It's a great weapon for pairing with others that deal more direct damage, because you can toss out a few eggs and then proceed to manage the battlefield more directly with your other weapons. Plus, deploying a bunch of mad bomber robots is just always fun.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Warmonger</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4058172-warmonger.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The Warmonger is one of the absolute best weapons when you just need to blow something up real good. The massive multi-rocket launcher has a low rate of fire, but who needs loads of shots when you have such a massive explosion? It can be upgraded to the aptly-named Peacemaker for even more rocket power, making it the perfect choice for dispatching big, slow-moving bosses or clearing a crowded area.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Nano-Swarmer</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4058173-nanoswarmer.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Nano Swarmer is a lot like the Bee Mine Glove, with the added benefit of letting you directly control its swarm of angry robots by targeting them with a laser pointer. It's like the attack raptors in the Jurassic World movies, except not stupid. It deploys as a turret, so you'll want to stick it into the middle of the action and then let it go to work.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Laser Tracer</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4058174-lasertracer.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">There's nothing quite like a classic laser cannon. While not the most creative weapon in Ratchet's arsenal, the simple destructive power of this one makes it worthwhile. The device is so big that it stays stationary on the ground, so you can only fire it while standing still and protected by a shield. But it packs a wallop on enemies in a very small concentrated area, making it an excellent choice for taking down some big boys or elite enemies that might get in your way.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Suck Cannon</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4058175-suckcannon.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Essentially a superpowered vacuum cleaner, the Suck Cannon is unique mostly for how it acquires and uses ammunition. Rather than simply find ammo laying around like many other weapons, this one sucks up potential ammo--including some smaller enemy types--and then spits them out at other enemies. On some appearances it's even been upgraded to the Vortex Cannon, which creates a swirling mass of vacuum-based death.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Pixelizer</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4058177-pixelizer.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The Pixelizer is mostly notable for its visual effect rather than its gameplay functionality, but that effect is so fun that it earns a spot on our favorites. It's essentially a shotgun blast, with a wide, short-ranged area of effect. But rather than simply spread a big dose of buckshot at your foes, you slap them with a blast of pixels that in effect pixelizes them, too. It's a fun way to play with video game history in a series that has always been 3D.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sheepinator</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4058178-sheepinator.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">A weapon that turns your enemies into harmless sheep. What's not to love? The Sheepinator fires a continuous beam at your enemies to turn them into sheep, and it doesn't consume traditional ammo in doing so. That means you can take care of a smaller enemy swarm without taking up your precious ammunition, or even just humiliate more elite enemies by holding the beam on them long enough to turn them into fluffy little critters. It gets even better once you upgrade to the Black Sheepinator, which makes some of your enemy sheep explode on the others.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>RYNO</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4058181-ryno.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The ultimate reward weapon at the end of every Ratchet game, the RYNO (which purportedly stands for \"Rip Ya A New One\") is often the strongest weapon in each game. This rocket launcher fires a barrage of extremely powerful rockets. Each individual shell does as much damage alone as some of the games' most powerful weapons, and it can auto-target several different enemies at once. It's the ultimate weapon with unmatched destructive power.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Groovitron</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4058179-groovitron.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">On the other end of the spectrum, the Groovitron does no direct damage to enemies, but it incapacitates them long enough that you can dispatch them with ease. The floating disco ball can be deployed from a glove or a mine, and once it's on the battlefield your enemies will be overcome with the compulsion to dance the night away. Aside from just being helpful utility on the battlefield, it's obviously super fun to watch Ratchet's wide array of alien weirdos bust a move.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Zurkon Family</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4058180-mrzurkon.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing shows the playful spirit of Ratchet &amp; Clank quite like Mr. Zurkon and his associated family. The tiny murderous robot first appeared in Ratchet &amp; Clank: Tools of Destruction, and he was so beloved he's gone on to appear in just about every Ratchet game since. Functionally, he's a little autonomous robot that roams around the battlefield wreaking absolute havoc on enemies. He can be upgraded to do ever-increasing damage, but the absolute best iteration is in Ratchet &amp; Clank: Into the Nexus. In that game, you can upgrade him to bring along the entire family: Mr. Zurkon, Zurkon Jr. and Mrs. Zurkon, all of whom pack their own punch. The Zurkons became so popular that they even became vendor NPCs in the latest game, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart. By that point they've settled down a bit, but we can always hope the Zurkons will be back to their old ways soon enough.</p></h3></p><br />", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-is-95-done-release-date-reveal-expected-by-the-end-of-the-year/1100-6508903/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Final Fantasy 16 Is \"95%\" Done, Release Date Reveal Expected By The End Of The Year", "date_published": "2022-11-04 13:55:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Final Fantasy 16 has almost reached the finish line of its development cycle, as main director Hiroshi Takai and other members of the development team revealed new details on the game in a series of interviews.
