  <p id="dyb4rh">Nuro, the autonomous delivery startup, is laying off 20 percent of its staff, or about 300 employees, the company said in an email to employees that was later <a href="https://medium.com/nuro/nuro-founders-message-to-employees-5e138db161e1">published online</a>.

But Nuro has since run into economic headwinds that are challenging the entire tech industry, and it could no longer sustain the size of its workforce. The layoffs were the latest piece of bad news to hit the AV industry, which just saw one of its more prominent names, Argo AI, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23423998/argo-ai-shut-down-ford-vw-av-self-driving">shut down in recent weeks</a>. </p>

<p id="vARryI">Notably, two of the three accounts were banned because of tweets misgendering trans people.
