It happened in 2006, and you may remember it. He certainly does, the regret remaining even though it might have been the best mistake he ever made.

Liverpool\u2019s captain hit an absurd shot and everything shifted. \u201cI lost an FA Cup, it was partly my fault because I didn\u2019t clear well, and life changed,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWest Ham don\u2019t want to sign me, I return to Spain.

As its brilliant portrait of the tragic hedonism of 1930s Berlin reaches a season finale, the team behind it tell its tale</p><p>Babylon Berlin is the most expensive German television drama ever made. It\u2019s also the most successful, with its depiction of Weimar Republic-era Berlin having been shown in more than 100 countries worldwide. Since its early seasons this detective noir show has exploded with colour, razzle-dazzle, danger and sweeping set pieces, and it has now spent five years vividly bringing to life a decade-long flash of chaotic democracy that ended in economic turmoil, corruption and, ultimately, fascism. With its superb opening titles, breathless, trippy pace and extravagant song-and-dance numbers \u2013 last season even saw a turn from Bryan Ferry, singing a German jazz version of his song Bitter-Sweet \u2013 heady, dangerous times have never been better depicted.</p><p>This season, the feel of the show has become even more menacing. Since its October launch on Sky Atlantic, UK viewers have been given a darker, wintry vision of Berlin, its smoky streets lined with the dishevelled and desperate victims of the 1929 crash. The Nazis are no longer lurking menacingly in the wings, but are violently taking centre stage. Lead detective Gereon Rath, played by Volker Bruch, has found himself uncomfortably close to Hitler\u2019s militant supporters as he undertakes a secret assignment to infiltrate the National Socialist party. As the city descends into chaos, all the dancing and hedonism takes on a new poignancy, as it becomes clear that decadence is now a last, desperate refuge from the dreadful world outside the ballrooms. At one point, we see one of the show\u2019s lead characters \u2013 flapper girl and sex worker-turned-aspiring-detective<strong> </strong>Charlotte \u201cLotte\u201d Ritter, played by Liv Lisa Fries \u2013 nearly lose her job when she tries to help her homeless sister.

And those who have played under him are quick to praise his motivational skills</p><p>John Herdman stands in front of a yellow conference room wall, shifting his weight from one foot to the other, off to the side of a projector screen. It displays a quote from Sun Tzu in one corner and a dramatic description of a wildfire along the bottom. He leans into the latter.<br /><br />\u201cIt gains a terrifying momentum. That\u2019s what it gains \u2013 a terrifying momentum. This red shirt, this team,\u201d the Canada manager tells his players. \u201cIt consumes everything in its path: Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Aruba, Suriname \u2026 and then you\u2019ll be ready. What a fucking journey.\u201d<br /><br />If the identities of the four teams in that path somewhat detract from the speech, they really shouldn\u2019t. This is the world that Canada\u2019s men\u2019s national team were operating in just a year and a half ago. Next week Herdman, an Englishman who has become a hero in Canada, will send his team out to face Belgium in the country\u2019s first men\u2019s World Cup match for nearly four decades. <br /><br />The speech is one of the first stirring moments <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/wecan\">from WeCAN</a>, a behind-the-scenes series charting Canada\u2019s rollicking run through Concacaf qualifying en route to Qatar. There are plenty more. But in truth, this is all merely part of the journey.<br /><br />Just one Canadian player was born before Mexico 86, the last time the country played on the game\u2019s grandest stage \u2013 indomitable skipper Atiba Hutchinson who turns 40 in February. Much is rightly made of the rawness and inexperience of the team he captains. But Herdman, the 47-year-old former teacher from Durham, does not lack for experience. Qatar, remarkably, will be the fourth senior World Cup of a management career that started in earnest 16 years ago.<br /><br />Herdman talks about history as something to be torn up or rewritten, to be challenged or made and remade. When asked last week what it meant to him to be the first manager ever to take a team to a men\u2019s and women\u2019s World Cup, he spoke of how pivotal it is to be \u201cpracticing what I preach\u201d.<br /><br />The preaching is, and appears to have always been, the key part of Herdman\u2019s practice. Spend time with any of those who he\u2019s brought with him on his journey from skills camps in northern England and doubters at the Sunderland Academy to grassroots roles in New Zealand that turned to national team jobs there and in Canada, and the talk always comes back to the talk. Herdman is a master of motivation.<br /><br />\u201cJohn is built for these kind of tournaments,\u201d says Melissa Tancredi, the former Canadian stalwart who played under Herdman at the 2015 Women\u2019s World Cup. \u201cHe\u2019s been through it all. He\u2019s been through one at home [in Canada] when we all felt that pressure so I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any inexperience with John.</p><p>\u201cThis man has something that most managers don\u2019t and that\u2019s his ability to actually connect with players and get the absolute best out of them. He\u2019s a mastermind. I\u2019ve never had, or heard of, a coach who is able to connect with players like he does. He\u2019s an absolute beauty in terms of a motivator. He has that ability to calm the situation or bring it to where he needs to bring it, he\u2019s a calibrator. You don\u2019t really learn that, it\u2019s something you\u2019re innately given.\u201d<br /><br />While Herdman has undoubtedly grown as a tactician during his years in the international game, Tancredi\u2019s argument that the psychological and cultural skills were a feature from the jump is backed up by those who were there at the start.<br /><br />Wendi Henderson was long since retired from the New Zealand national team and was feeling her way back into club football, initially for fun, in 2006 when someone approached her on the sidelines in Wellington.<br /><br />\u201cIt was John Herdman. He said he\u2019d just been appointed as Football Ferns manager and asked: \u2018Where are you at?\u2019\u201d Henderson says. \u201cI started laughing. \u2018Where am I at?

The inspiration for this shimmering tale is an Old English poem The Wife\u2019s Lament, which features in the Exeter Book, a 10th-century anthology of verse, often known as the Old English Elegies, which is one of the largest surviving collections of early medieval literature (several of the original poems feature in Wild\u2019s appendix).</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/18/wild-by-amy-jeffs-audiobook-review-otherworldly-tales-from-medieval-britain\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/18/backed-by-the-butter-board-then-a-cannes-premiere-rediscovering-the-films-of-wendy-toye", "title": "Backed by the Butter Board \u2013 then a Cannes premiere: rediscovering the films of Wendy Toye", "date_published": "2022-11-18 10:00:01+00:00", "description": "<p>A dancer, choreographer and director who made her stage debut aged three, Toye was a creative powerhouse who left an estimable legacy as a film director.

While studying jazz at New Hampshire\u2019s<strong> </strong>Dartmouth College, an institution founded to train Native Americans as Christian missionaries, they found field recordings of Abenaki songs and stories locked away in the archives. On Sweet Tooth, Obomsawin repatriates some of the music of their people, and their responses to it, into a suite of resistance.</p><p>Sweet Tooth begins with Odana, an arrangement of an early 18th-century Abenaki ballad. Telling the story of Obomsawin\u2019s village\u2019s founding, their voice is deep, beautiful and powerful, accompanied by brass and shimmering, rolling percussion. Lineage follows, an original composition, evoking the period of more than 12,000 years that passed before the arrival of Europeans on Wabanaki land. Then comes the extraordinary Wawasint8da, based on a translation of a Jesuit hymn, brought into the community by a priest intent on indoctrination.
