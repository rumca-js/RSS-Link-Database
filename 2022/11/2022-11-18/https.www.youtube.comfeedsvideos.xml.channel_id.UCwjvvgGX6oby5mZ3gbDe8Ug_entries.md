#Chinainsights#Guangzhouprotest
Throughout the history of the rule of the Chinese Communist Party in China, one of its main tactics has been to instill fear in the people. It sends this message of terror around the country by severely suppressing and punishing individuals who challenge it.
In Guangzhou, it can be said that the city's residents succeeded in their massive protest this time. Itâ€™s not a usual occurrence in China. Previously, more than 5 million people had been under lockdown in Guangzhou, and red fences were everywhere.
