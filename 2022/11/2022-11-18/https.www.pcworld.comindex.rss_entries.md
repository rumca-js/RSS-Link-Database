<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Nvidia finally broke its silence and says improperly seated 12VHPWR connectors are largely to blame for those <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1372988/heres-what-we-know-about-the-geforce-rtx-4090-12vhpwr-cables-melting.html">GeForce RTX 4090 power cable meltdowns</a>.</p>



<p>The company, which thus far has been mum other than to confirm it was investigating the problem, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QmKYJzJhB4&amp;xcust=2-1-1386084-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">issued a statement to Gamers Nexus </a>that also confirmed how many cases it knows of.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are actively investigating the reports. We are aware of about 50 cases globally,&rdquo; a company spokesperson told Gamers Nexus editor-in-chief Stephen Burke, according to a video Gamers Nexus posted to its YouTube channel Friday morning.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Our findings to date suggest that a common issue is that connectors are not fully plugged into the graphics card,&rdquo; Nvidia told Burke. &ldquo;To help ensure the connector is secure, we recommend plugging the power dongle into the graphics card first to ensure it&rsquo;s firmly and evenly plugged in, before plugging the graphics card into the motherboard.&rdquo;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure><p>Nvidia officials also told Burke that returned cable adapters all appeared to show wear damage indicating they weren&rsquo;t fully seated. The company also posted its <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5413&amp;xcust=2-1-1386084-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement on its customer help page</a> where it shows what a properly inserted cable looks like. </p>



<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s statement largely seems to back up what Burke and his team discovered yesterday: An excessively loose 12VHPWR connector in the GPU can lead to high temperatures which melts the connector. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1382376/gamers-nexus-investigation-finds-loose-cables-manufacturing-debris-behind-12vhpwr-melting.html">the Gamers Nexus investigation</a>, the failed connectors Burke obtained often had physical damage, indicating the plug had largely backed out of the GPU. Gamers Nexus also largely concluded that debris from manufacturing, as well as debris caused by consumers possibly inserting and removing the connector, could possibly cause the RTX 4090 cables to melt but the most likely cause was a loose connector.</p>



<p>Others, including <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkN81jRaupA&amp;xcust=2-1-1386084-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Techlab.net.br&rsquo;s Ronaldo Buassali</a> and Jon Gerow, Director of Research at Corsair, had done their own testing previously and concluded the connector is well able to handle the current being pushed through it&mdash;so long as it is fully connected.</p>



<p>Of course, the lingering question is those improper insertions steam from an underlying connector design issue. With evidence now clear that the cable is capable supporting the power behind it, many are wondering if the latch could be improved or not.</p>



<p>Nvidia officials did tell Burke that &ldquo;We are investigating additional ways to ensure that the connector is secure before powering on the graphics card.&rdquo;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090" class="wp-image-1348184" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nvidia-GeForce-RTX-4090-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>Other ideas have been floated, such as having the cards refuse to post if the sense pins on the plugs are not fully seated. The PCI-SIG group, in fact, has been said to be considering design changes to the new plug.</p>



<p>Nvidia also responded to concerns by consumers that it would not honor warranties if a consumer uses a &ldquo;third-party adapter&rdquo; 12VHPWR connector, such as the custom and modded right-angle cables people are buying in hopes of avoiding a melted connector. That raised concerns Nvidia and board partners would then not honor a warranty if the native 12VHPWR connector on a new PSU was used.</p>



<p>In a statement released to both PCWorld a company spokesman said the concern was unwarranted. &ldquo;NVIDIA and our partners are committed to supporting our customers, regardless of the cable or power supply used,&rdquo; an Nvidia spokesman said.</p>



<p>Perhaps more importantly, Nvidia also told Gamers Nexus that it and partners would honor RMAs from cards damaged by improper insertion. &ldquo;Anybody who has an issue [relating to this] will be taken care of,&rdquo; the company told Burke. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll expedite an RMA.&rdquo;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090" class="wp-image-1348182" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nvidia-GeForce-RTX-4090-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>So how many GeForce RTX 4090 cards suffered from melting connectors? Gamers Nexus reports that board partners have told it 125,000 GeForce RTX 4090 cards have been sold, which would put the known failure rate at 0.04 percent, Burke said.</p>



<p>The statement comes a day after a GeForce RTX 4090 owner apparently filed a class-action suit against Nvidia over the melting connectors, according to a report in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/rtx-4090-owner-hits-nvidia-with-lawsuit-over-melting-16-pin-connector&amp;xcust=2-1-1386084-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lucas Genova filed his suit on Nov. 11 and alleges that Nvidia &ldquo;marketed and sold the RTX 4090 with a defective and dangerous power cable plug and socket, which has rendered consumers&rsquo; cards inoperable and poses a serious electrical and fire hazard for each and every purchaser.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can still catch other excellent discounts online, of course. Whether you need a wallet-friendly budget model or one with blistering speed, you can find something. If you&rsquo;re new to SSDs, be aware that they all don&rsquo;t perform the same. For example, the Crucial P2 is on the slower side for a PCIe Gen 3, but works well as a secondary drive for photos, games, etc. It&rsquo;ll run faster than a 1TB SATA SSD while costing only a bit more.</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>If you&rsquo;re looking to level up your gaming space, you&rsquo;re in luck, as we&rsquo;ve got a great deal for you today. Amazon&rsquo;s selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Cynosa-Chroma-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B075KMZ4MX/ref=sr_1_12?crid=18GSBMLO6CYXI&amp;keywords=keyboards&amp;qid=1668782614&amp;sprefix=keyboards%2Caps%2C69&amp;sr=8-12&amp;th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1385607-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Razer Cynosa Chroma gaming keyboard for $39.99</a>, which is a savings of $20. According to Razer, it has a spill-resistant design and the keys make little to no noise. Let&rsquo;s get right into the nitty gritty.</p>



<p>This keyboard features individually backlit RGB keys that you can customize. It also works with Razer&rsquo;s Synapse software. This allows you to rebind buttons, assign macros, and so on. If you&rsquo;re a PC gamer, you know how important customizing your gear is, as it makes a world of difference.</p>



<p>This is a solid deal. It&rsquo;s not a mechanical keyboard though, so you won&rsquo;t be able to swap out the keycaps. If that&rsquo;s not a deal-breaker to you and you prefer a quieter keyboard anyway, then the Razer Cynosa is well worth considering. </p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Buying a processor for a gaming rig is both easier and harder than it used to be. AMD&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1095682/amd-ryzen-7000-cpus-tested-6-essential-things-to-know.html">Ryzen 7000-series</a> and Intel&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357979/intel-core-i9-13900k-review.html">13th-gen Core CPUs</a> offer fantastic performance&mdash;with the promise of even more impressive chips on the way. (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1065404/intels-new-raptor-lake-cpus-will-run-at-6ghz.html">6GHz clock speeds</a>, anyone?) If you want hearty performance, the fastest clock speeds and highest core counts yet await you. It&rsquo;s very straightforward.</p>



<p>The rough part is the complexity of these new chip lineups. There&rsquo;s more nuance to understand, especially when deciding between the new hotness and last-gen&rsquo;s best. Sure, you can throw your cash blindly at the best out there, but if you want the most bang for your gaming buck, smart shopping will leave more cash for higher priorities: that is, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3106426/components-graphics/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">your graphics card</a>. A few specific chips stand out from the rest as the best gaming CPUs due to their price, performance, or nifty extras. You can choose from a whole raft of runners-up too, thanks to a current pricing war between AMD and Intel. (It&rsquo;s even amplified by holiday sales at the moment.)</p>



<p>Whether you&rsquo;re on a budget or willing to pay for sheer face-melting <em>speed</em>, these are the best CPUs for gaming PCs that you can buy. </p>

<p>Midrange CPUs are the sweet spot for PC gamers. In fact, if you don&rsquo;t need the additional cores of pricier CPU options, this class of chip offers essentially the same gaming experience of processors that cost hundreds more. The reason? Most of the computing burden falls on your graphics card.</p>

<p>At an MSRP of about $200, the Intel Core i5-12400 strikes a smooth balance between performance and affordability. Sure, it&rsquo;s technically a last-generation chip now, with Intel&rsquo;s launch of 13th-gen Raptor Lake processors. But a comparable successor is still on the way (as is a comparable rival from AMD), leaving the 12400 to continue ruling the sub-$300 space. And for good reason: This six-core, 12-thread processor offers plenty of oomph. Have a peek at gaming benchmarks in reviews (like those at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/core_i5_12400_processor_review,23.html&amp;xcust=2-1-401980-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Guru3D</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-core-i5-12400-review-benchmarks-overclocking/?msclkid=fd36d43eb58a11ec9fbc110dc4ffb46d&amp;xcust=2-1-401980-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">PCGamer</a>) and you&rsquo;ll see the Core i5-12400 usually trails behind the $320 Core i5-12600K and $589 Core i9-12900K by only a handful of frames at 1080p, 1440p, and 4K. You also don&rsquo;t need to upgrade to Windows 11 to get the most out of this chip. </p>

<p>This CPU also outperforms AMD&rsquo;s rival Ryzen 5 5600 slightly. If you&rsquo;re upgrading from an older AM4 B450 motherboard, you may find it more cost-effective to stick with AMD (especially given AMD&rsquo;s steep price drops as of late), but otherwise, the 12400 is the chip to get.</p>

<p>Need more cores for productivity tasks, want eight cores for streaming or future-proofing against console hardware configurations, or simply demand the absolute fastest potential frame rates in any situation? The $589 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357979/intel-core-i9-13900k-review.html">Intel Core i9-13900K</a> is the 16-core, 32-thread processor for you.</p>

<p>AMD&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7900X-24-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BBJ59WJ4/ref=sr_1_2?crid=IYEU3P7JFEZG&amp;keywords=7900x&amp;qid=1668757962&amp;s=electronics&amp;sprefix=7900%2Celectronics%2C189&amp;sr=1-2&amp;ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.08f69ac3-fd3d-4b88-bca2-8997e41410bb&amp;xcust=2-1-401980-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$550 Ryzen 9 7900X</a> is another solid option that offers high frame rates, but paying that much for a 12-core chip doesn&rsquo;t make sense if pure gaming is your goal.</p>

<p>The big caveat to these recommendations: They&rsquo;re best if you don&rsquo;t care about electricity costs. AMD and Intel&rsquo;s latest architectures both take a &ldquo;more is more&rdquo; approach to energy consumption, with Ryzen 7000 and 13th-gen Raptor Lake both gobbling down watts to achieve mindbending performance.</p>

<p>So if you simply want ultra-fast gaming frame rates and don&rsquo;t need a borderline insane amount of CPU cores for productivity work or care to spike your utility bills, consider stepping down to the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-13700K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/dp/B0BCF57FL5&amp;xcust=2-1-401980-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Core i7-13700K</a> (MSRP $409) or even <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i5-13600K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/dp/B0BCDR9M33/&amp;xcust=2-1-401980-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Core i5-13600K</a> (MSRP $319). The 13700K shares the core count (and 8/8 split between performance and efficiency cores) as the 13900K, with fewer threads (24). The 13600K drops down to &ldquo;just&rdquo; 14 cores (6p/8e split), but given its ability to match Intel&rsquo;s last-gen flagship, the Core i9-12900K, in game benchmarks, it&rsquo;s an incredible sweet spot for high-octane gaming.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, if you don&rsquo;t mind spending up for the ultimate 1080p gaming performance and already have a first- or second-generation Ryzen motherboard, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/701130/tested-the-ryzen-7-5800x3ds-astonishing-performance-shows-how-far-amds-ryzen-has-come.html">Ryzen 7 5800X3D is a killer</a> upgrade option, especially given its recent lower street prices ($330~).</p>

<p>Just four chips were part of Intel&rsquo;s 13th-gen Raptor Lake launch. The cheapest of them sports an MSRP of $319&mdash;hardly budget territory.</p>

<p>So for now, last generation parts still rule here. You have several options in the $100 to $135(ish) range, with one extremely compelling standout among them. As you&rsquo;ll see in gaming benchmarks from sites like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-core-i3-12100-12100f-review&amp;xcust=2-1-401980-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techspot.com/review/2409-intel-core-i3-12100f/&amp;xcust=2-1-401980-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">TechSpot</a>, Intel&rsquo;s $110 Core i3-12100F doesn&rsquo;t just offer a hefty boost in frame rates when pitted against AMD&rsquo;s comparable offering. It also posts gaming performance nearly on par with Intel&rsquo;s last-gen Core i5-11600K&mdash;a processor that costs twice as much.</p>

<p>You must have a dedicated graphics card to pair with this CPU, however. This variant of the $135 Core i3-12100 lacks integrated graphics, which is how you save cash. If you&rsquo;re still saving your pennies for a (reasonably) affordable graphics card, you may instead want one of AMD&rsquo;s APUs, which we discuss in the next entry below.</p>

<p>Graphics cards are coming down in price now (<em>finally</em>), but shelves aren&rsquo;t yet flush with affordable cards. One workaround is to purchase an APU, or a CPU with supercharged integrated graphics. We recommended this tactic last year and it still works well now&mdash;especially since the street prices of the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5600G-12-Thread-Processor/dp/B092L9GF5N/&amp;xcust=2-1-401980-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Ryzen 5 5600G</a> (MSRP $260) and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5700G-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B091J3NYVF&amp;xcust=2-1-401980-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Ryzen 7 5700G processors</a> (MSRP $360) have plummeted with the recent launch of new CPU lineups from AMD and Intel. You can now play most games at 720p or 1080p resolution for well under these APUs&rsquo; list price. In the last few months, the 5600G&rsquo;s cost dropped by almost half and the 5700G by about one-third.</p>

<p>The beauty of this approach is that you can play games now on this one purchase, then snag a graphics card at your leisure (and within budget). The CPU cores in these APUs are very good for mainstream gaming, as our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394942/ryzen-7-5700g-review.html">Ryzen 7 5700G review</a> showed.</p>

<p>The 5600G offers 6 cores and 12 threads, paired with 7 Radeon graphics cores clocked at 1.9GHz. The step-up 5700G bumps that up to 8 cores and 16 threads, alongside 8 Radeon cores running at 2GHz. Most shoppers on a budget are better off with the cheaper part, unless you have a specific need for the higher CPU core count in the Ryzen 7 chip.</p>

<h2 class="" id="how-we-test-cpus">How we test CPUs</h2>

<p>We evaluate CPUs based on the benchmark results that span multiple use categories. Gaming performance is a key focus, and we run both synthetic tests (that is, dedicated benchmarking programs) and in-game benchmarks in a variety of modern titles. Our current suite includes <em>Far Cry 6</em>, <em>Strange Brigade</em>, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, <em>Metro Exodus</em>, <em>Gears Tatics</em>, <em>CS: Go</em>, <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, <em>Ashes of the Singularity</em>, and <em>Dirt 5</em>. We also evaluate CPU reviews from our peers for models we haven&rsquo;t tested yet. </p>

<p>Test PCs are built with the CPU&rsquo;s capabilities in mind&mdash;for example, AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 7950X and Intel&rsquo;s Core i9-13900K support DDR5 RAM. Rival and older chips used for comparison are retested at the same time, with a similar use of appropriate contemporaneous hardware. In all our test rigs, we use a current high-end flagship graphics card to better isolate differences in the CPUs&rsquo; performance.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/626194/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-an-inexpensive-workhorse-for-the-everyday-person.html">Acer Chromebook Spin 713</a> is a phenomenal convertible laptop for remote workers because of its zippy performance and versatile form factor.

Other features include a vibrant 2256&times;1504 touch-enabled display, all-day battery life, and a diverse selection of ports. So long as you don&rsquo;t need Windows, the Spin 713 is a fantastic everyday laptop. <em>&mdash;Ashley Biancuzzo</em></p>

<p>Laptops are made to be portable, and they excel in that task. When you&rsquo;re spending all day hunkered down in your home office, expanding your laptop&rsquo;s capabilities can not only help you get more done, it can help you feel comfortable&mdash;staring at a full-sized monitor and typing away on a proper keyboard does wonders for ergonomics. That&rsquo;s where a Thunderbolt docking station can pay dividends, despite their high prices.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve tested a slew of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">Thunderbolt docks</a> in 2022 and our go-to recommendation is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/918583/kensington-sd5500t-thunderbolt-3-dock-review.html">Kensington SD5500T Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C Docking Station</a>, because of its smart compromises. It sticks to the tried-and-true Thunderbolt 3 standard and includes a pair of DisplayPort options for external monitor connectivity, which helps keep the price around $260 in a field where most options go for north of $300. With a smart mix of ports and 60W of laptop charging power, this is the best Thunderbolt dock for anyone living the WFH life.</p>

<p>More screen space equals more productivity. But if you can&rsquo;t have (or don&rsquo;t want) a multi-monitor setup, an ultrawide monitor with abundant horizontal space to spread out apps is an enticing alternative. Most ultrawide displays focus on gaming, but our pick for the best WFH monitor of 2022, the 34-inch ultrawide <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1346674/asus-proart-pa348cgv-review.html">Asus ProArt PA348CGV</a>, works in features sure to make WFHers drool&hellip;while also including juicy gaming features for those after-hours play sessions.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The Asus ProArt PA348CGV is a superb ultrawide monitor that manages to serve a huge range of users,&rdquo; our reviewer said en route to handing out an Editors&rsquo; Choice Award. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s equally excellent for professional content creators, gamers, and prosumers who have basic needs but want a premium experience. It&rsquo;s also a rare example of a monitor that&rsquo;s equally suited to both content creation and gaming.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Bottom line? While there are a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">ton of great monitors</a> out there, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with the Asus ProArt PA348CGV. It&rsquo;s great no matter what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>

Enter the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/782535/logitech-lift-review.html">Logitech Lift wireless ergonomic mouse</a>, which easily earned our Editors&rsquo; Choice Award this year.</p>



<p>The Lift serves as a refinement of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FNJB8TT?&amp;xcust=2-1-1384165-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Logitech&rsquo;s similarly excellent MX Vertical</a>.

<p>Likewise, you spend all day typing away on your keyboard, so you want it to offer the most pleasant experience possible. As someone who has worked from home for over a decade, I&rsquo;ve found keyboards and mice to be the most vital components to a smooth WFH setup, and well worth spending up for. That&rsquo;s why the $205 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1364305/keychron-q8-review-a-quality-keyboard-for-the-ergo-riche.html">Keychron Q8 mechanical keyboard</a> earns our nod as the best keyboard for working from home this year.</p>



<p>Mechanical keyboards deliver a superior typing experience thanks to their responsiveness and sublime key travel, but the Keychron Q8 takes things to the next level with a relentless focus on quality&mdash;and a curved ergonomic key layout that spares your aching wrists. &ldquo;Keychron&rsquo;s Q series is once again impressive for quality and customization, now coming in the much-loved Alice layout,&rdquo; our reviewer said while crowning the Q8 with a rare Editors&rsquo; Choice Award. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an easy buy if you want an ergonomic layout with amazing typing and lots of features.&rdquo;</p>



<p>If you prefer a standard keyboard layout, however, cast your eyes to the Q8&rsquo;s sibling, the similarly $205 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/823922/keychron-q5-mechanical-keyboard-review.html">Keychron Q5</a>. &ldquo;It will ruin other mechanical keyboards for you,&rdquo; our headline crowed. This keyboard &ldquo;packs excellent typing feel, parts, and customization at a price that&rsquo;s about half as much as the customized designs it&rsquo;s based on,&rdquo; but lacks the Q8&rsquo;s ergo-friendly setup.</p>

</div>


<p>Legion, Lenovo&rsquo;s gaming sub-brand, is celebrating its five-year anniversary and its first half-decade has proven a success. Legion laptops are now strong competitors across a broad range of price points. The Legion 5i, a 15.6-inch gaming laptop, looks to push aside strong mid-range competitors such as Acer&rsquo;s Nitro 5. Lenovo&rsquo;s alternative delivers on performance and connectivity but still feels built to fit a tight budget.&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s get right into it.</p>



<h2 id="lenovo-legion-5i-specs-and-features">Lenovo Legion 5i specs and features</h2>



<p>The Lenovo Legion 5i&rsquo;s specifications are typical for a mid-range gaming laptop. Intel&rsquo;s Core i7-12700H processor leads the charge, as is true for nearly every gaming laptop on the market right now. It&rsquo;s joined by Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 3060, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of solid state storage. The SSD may be a sore point, as big budget games like <em>Destiny 2</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em> will quickly fill it.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i7-12700H</li><li>Memory: 16GB DDR5</li><li>Graphics/GPU: Nvidia RTX 3060</li><li>Display: 2560 x 1440 IPS 165Hz</li><li>Storage: 512GB PCIe Gen4 M.2 solid state drive</li><li>Webcam: 720p</li><li>Connectivity: 3x USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 with 135 watts Power Delivery and DisplayPort 1.4a, 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 with DisplayPort 1.4, 1x Thunderbolt 4 / USB4, 1x HDMI, 1x Ethernet, 1x 3.5mm audio combo, power connector</li><li>Networking: Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.1</li><li>Biometrics: None</li><li>Battery capacity: 80 watt-hours</li><li>Dimensions: 14.13 x 10.33 x 0.79 inches</li><li>Weight: 5.3 pounds</li><li>MSRP: $1,549.99</li></ul><p>One important note: the model Lenovo provided for this review is only available through Costco. The main difference is the display, which receives an upgrade from 1080p to 1440p resolution. Similar configurations with a 1080p are available direct from Lenovo starting at $1,399.99. The entry-level Legion 5i configuration, with an Intel Core i5-12500H processor and Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti graphics, is just $1,149.99.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="design-and-build-quality">Design and build quality</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Legion 5i build quality" class="wp-image-1373872" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/lenovo-legion-5i-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Lenovo&rsquo;s Legion 5i embraces a sleek, handsome style that&rsquo;s popular among numerous mid-range laptops. It measures about 0.8 inches thick, providing a somewhat thin profile, and weighs in at just 5.3 pounds. This puts it right in line with Acer&rsquo;s Predator Triton 300 SE and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/799933/alienware-x15-r2-review-a-15-inch-gaming-laptop-stacked-with-power-and-personality.html">Alienware&rsquo;s X15 R2</a>. The Legion 5i is slimmer than the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/819461/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-2022.html">Lenovo Legion 5 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1070976/1070976.html">Acer Predator Helios 300</a>.</p>



<p>The result is a design that looks professional and workmanlike. However, the laptop&rsquo;s build quality doesn&rsquo;t live up to expectations set by the design. I found flex in both the display lid and the lower chassis when handling the laptop roughly. To be clear, it&rsquo;s not terrible: older gaming laptops were far more flimsy. Still, the lack of rigidity is obvious next to a premium laptop like the Razer Blade 15 or Lenovo&rsquo;s own Legion 5 Pro.</p>



<p>Material quality is also unexceptional. The Legion 5i has metal panels along touch points but uses plastic on the lower chassis and surrounding the display. This is a fine way to cut costs, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel luxurious or stand out from competitors.</p>



<p>The net result? You get what you pay for. The Legion 5i looks and feels fine for a mid-range gaming laptop but doesn&rsquo;t stand out. There&rsquo;s a noticeable difference between this laptop and Lenovo&rsquo;s Legion 5 Pro, which I tested earlier this year. The Pro model is thicker and heavier but also feels more durable and rigid.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="keyboard-and-trackpad">Keyboard and trackpad</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Legion 5i keyboard and trackpad" class="wp-image-1373874" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/lenovo-legion-5i-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The Lenovo Legion 5i packs in a keyboard with numpad that makes aggressive use of the laptop&rsquo;s interior space. Almost every inch of width is crammed with keys, providing a spacious layout. Most keys are full sized though a few, such as the Backspace, are on the small side. The numpad keys are also undersized, which is normal for all 15.6-inch (and most 16- and 17-inch laptops) that include a numpad. I found the layout comfortable and easy to use.</p>



<p>Key feel is acceptable but doesn&rsquo;t stand out. Travel is acceptable but not long and keys bottom with a somewhat vague feel. Key action remains smooth, however, and rebounds nicely. Nitpicks aside, it&rsquo;s a usable keyboard and on par with most gaming laptops.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An RGB keyboard backlight is included and allows color customization across four keyboard zones. Its settings are controlled through Lenovo&rsquo;s Vantage software, which looks attractive and is easy to use. Backlight color is an issue, however, because some colors (red and yellow) appear too white or pastel. I noticed the same issue on Lenovo&rsquo;s Legion 5 Pro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The touchpad offers plenty of space, as it measures about five inches across and three inches deep. It&rsquo;s much smaller than class leaders like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1355238/corsair-voyager-a1600-review-corsairs-first-laptop-sprints-towards-victory-and-stumbles.html">Corsair Voyager a1600</a> but on par with the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE and much larger than the Alienware X15 R2. Windows multi-touch gestures work well, making it easy to flip through open tabs or clear open windows from the desktop.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="display-audio">Display, audio</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Legion 5i display" class="wp-image-1373876" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/lenovo-legion-5i-1-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The Lenovo Legion 5i I tested had a 2560&times;1440 165Hz IPS LCD display with a maximum refresh rate of 165Hz. Shoppers take note: this display may not be available on the model you&rsquo;re considering, as the configuration I tested is only available through Costco. Most Legion 5i models have a 1920&times;1080 IPS LCD with the same 165Hz refresh rate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a 16:9 aspect ratio display which, just a few years ago, was common. However, many laptops have switched to the taller 16:10 aspect ratio. The Legion 5i&rsquo;s display feels a bit tight by comparison because it has less vertical display space. This may be disappointing if you want to use the laptop for content creation. It&rsquo;s less important when gaming since most games target a 16:9 aspect ratio as the default.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Image quality has some strengths. The IPS LCD provides good color accuracy and looks vivid at its maximum brightness of 381 nits, which is much higher than its claimed maximum of 300 nits. Color accuracy is high and the color gamut covers the full sRGB color space, though only 80 percent of the larger DCI-P3 color space. The display&rsquo;s 1440p resolution, which packs 188 pixels per inch, ensures the image looks sharp and crisp. These traits make for a lifelike and eye-catching image when displaying bright and colorful titles like <em>Overwatch 2</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the display lacks contrast compared to laptops with OLED and Mini-LED displays such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/697179/asus-vivobook-pro-16x-oled-review-a-practical-creator-laptop-with-a-brilliant-display.html">Asus Vivobook Pro OLED</a> or Apple MacBook Pro. The Legion 5i can struggle with low-light details and shadows in dark games, like <em>Diablo II: Resurrected</em>, as well as gritty films like <em>The Batman</em>. With that said, most gaming laptops remain stuck on IPS LCD screens because they offer the highest refresh rates, so the Legion 5i&rsquo;s display quality is on par with competitors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The refresh rate can reach as high as 165Hz and, because of the laptop&rsquo;s performance and 1440p resolution, that refresh rate is achievable in so-called &ldquo;esports&rdquo; titles like <em>Counter-Strike</em> and <em>League of Legends</em>. Motion clarity is good at high refresh rates but doesn&rsquo;t stand out when framerates are lower. The laptop supports both <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/423202/g-sync-vs-freesync-amd-nvidia-monitor.html">G-Sync </a>and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/428441/how-to-use-nvidia-optimus-to-switch-active-gpus-and-save-power-on-linux-laptops.html">Nvidia Optimus</a>, providing smooth frame pacing in games and improving battery life (though Optimus runs into some issues, which I&rsquo;ll discuss in the battery life section of this review).</p>



<p>The Legion 5i&rsquo;s speakers aren&rsquo;t great. They are downward-firing, which means audio quality and volume will change depending on the surface the laptop is on. Maximum volume is loud enough to provide some punch but also muddies the quality as thin bass creeps into the midrange and highs turn shrill. Audio quality is acceptable for gameplay or music at modest volume, but headphones will be desirable for more serious use.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="webcam-microphone-biometrics">Webcam, microphone, biometrics</h2>



<p>The Lenovo Legion 5i has a 720p webcam. Video quality is grainy, soft, and dull, though fine for most video calls. An electronic privacy shutter is included and activated using a physical switch on the laptop&rsquo;s right flank.&nbsp;Microphone quality is also mediocre. It provides good volume, but my voice was distant and hollow in recordings. The result is usable for video calls, however, so it does the job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Legion 5i doesn&rsquo;t offer biometric options. Though a bit disappointing, this cut-costing measure is typical for a mid-range laptop.</p>



<h2 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Legion 5i ports" class="wp-image-1373878" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/lenovo-legion-5i-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The Lenovo Legion 5i offers a healthy dose of future-proof connectivity spanning two USB-C ports and one Thunderbolt 4/USB-C ports. The rear USB-C port supports DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 135 watts of Power Delivery, while left-flank USB-C and Thunderbolt 4 ports only offer DisplayPort Alternate Mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rear USB-C port&rsquo;s Power Delivery is notable because its maximum of 135 watts is much higher than competitors, which typically have a maximum of 90 to 95 watts (if they have it at all). This still isn&rsquo;t enough to fully power the laptop under heavy load, as it comes with a 300-watt power adapter. However, it can provide reasonable charging speed and keep the laptop charged during light to medium use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lenovo doesn&rsquo;t skimp on USB-A, either, providing three USB-A ports: one on the right flank and two around rear. The rear points are joined by HDMI-out, Ethernet, and the laptop&rsquo;s power connector. The healthy selection of rear-facing port options will help with cable management when the laptop is docked on a desk.</p>



<p>Wireless connectivity is provided by <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/552421/wi-fi-performance-matters-more-than-you-think.html">Wi-Fi 6E</a> and Bluetooth 5.1. Support for Wi-Fi 6E, which is the latest Wi-Fi standard, ensures the laptop can provide great wireless performance when used with a Wi-Fi 6E router. Bluetooth 5.1 is a step behind the latest Bluetooth 5.2, and it&rsquo;s a bit odd to see 5.2 is not supported. However, the features in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bluetooth.com/bluetooth-resources/bluetooth-core-specification-version-5-2-feature-overview/&amp;xcust=2-1-1372718-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Bluetooth 5.2</a> are minor and largely apply to Bluetooth audio.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>



<p>The Lenovo Legion 5i I tested had an Intel Core i7-12700H. This is a 14-core, 20-thread processor that&rsquo;s effectively standard issue for all new mid-range and some premium gaming laptops. It&rsquo;s supported by an Nvidia RTX 3060 with a beefy maximum power of 140 watts. 16GB of DDR5 RAM and a 512GB PCIe solid state drive round out the spec sheet. The results shown in our graphs were achieved in the laptop&rsquo;s standard &ldquo;Balanced&rdquo; power profile.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Legion 5i PCMark" class="wp-image-1373880" height="712" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/lenovo-legion-5i-pcmark.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>PCMark 10 starts the Lenovo Legion 5i off on the right foot. It achieves a combined score of 7,167, which is the third-best of this competitive set and a bit above the overall average for similar laptops. With that said, all of the laptops shown in this graph achieve generally similar results.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Legion 5i Cinebench" class="wp-image-1373883" height="708" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/lenovo-legion-5i-cinebench.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Next up is Cinebench R15 multi-thread, a heavily threaded, demanding, but short-duration benchmark. The Legion 5i does extremely well here, as its score of 2,431 is again the third-best in this competitive set. It also is quite far above the average. It&rsquo;s impressive to see the mid-range Legion 5i run far ahead of competitors like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1064746/razer-blade-15-review-2.html">Razer Blade 15</a>, which is much more expensive.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Legion 5i Handbrake" class="wp-image-1373885" height="716" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/lenovo-legion-5i-handbrake.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Handbrake, a video encoding tool, is a heavily threaded, long duration benchmark that puts a laptop&rsquo;s thermals to the tests. The Legion 5i dips a bit below the average on this test and is the fourth-quickest overall, but its performance remains solid for a mid-range gaming laptop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now we move onto graphics benchmarks. The Legion 5i&rsquo;s inclusion of an Nvidia RTX 3060 might seem underwhelming, but the devil is in the details. This is a 140-watt incarnation, the highest available for laptops with an RTX 3060. So, does that lead to excellent performance?</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Legion 5i 3DMark" class="wp-image-1373887" height="698" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/lenovo-legion-5i-3dmark.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The 3DMark Time Spy benchmark reached a score of 8,335. This is almost identical, though a tad lower than, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/700135/acer-nitro-5-review-a-gamers-gaming-laptop.html">Acer Nitro 5</a>&mdash;another laptop with Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics and a 140-watt TGP. Laptops with RTX 3070 and RTX 3070 Ti hardware tend to be around 20 percent quicker but, of course, have higher price tags.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Legion 5i Shadow of the Tomb Raider" class="wp-image-1373889" height="755" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/lenovo-legion-5i-shadow-of-the-tomb-raider.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p><em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> averages a blistering 110 frames-per-second, which is an excellent result for an RTX 3060 laptop. The Legion 5i slightly beats the Acer Nitro 5 here, though only by four frames per second.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laptops with better Nvidia RTX mobile graphics continue to deliver better results, however. Some, like the Lenovo Legion 5 Pro and Alienware X15 R2, are over 30 percent quicker.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Legion 5i Metro Exodus" class="wp-image-1373890" height="713" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/lenovo-legion-5i-metro-exodus.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p><em>Metro Exodus </em>tells a familiar story. The Lenovo Legion 5i averaged 38 frames per second, which is a solid result for a mid-range laptop and just a few frames short of some RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 laptops. However, the Acer Nitro 5 is a bit stronger in this test.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Lenovo Legion 5 Pro and Alienware X15 R2 once again leap way ahead of the pack, so those will be a better choice if you want maximum performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even ray-tracing is within reach. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> averaged 25 frames per second at Ultra settings and 1080p resolution with RTX Ray Tracing turned on and DLSS off. Tweaking a few settings (such as turning on DLSS or reducing Ray Tracing quality to Medium) bumps the average above 30 frames per second.</p>



<p>All tests in this review were performed with the laptop&rsquo;s Balanced mode turned on. This mode offered acceptable fan noise and temperatures, though fan noise did start to become annoying in the most demanding games (like <em>Metro Exodus)</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Lenovo Legion also has a Performance mode. It delivered much higher performance in some situations. Cinebench R15 returned a score of 2,710, which is a 14 percent improvement over the Balanced Mode, and <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> gained 10 frames per second. Unfortunately, this mode was annoyingly loud. That limits its real-world usefulness, but it&rsquo;s worth turning on if you plan to set the laptop to a demanding long duration task (like encoding an edit of a 4K video) and leave for lunch.</p>



<h2 id="battery-life">Battery life</h2>



<p>The Lenovo Legion 5i comes equipped with an 80 watt-hour battery. That&rsquo;s a respectable size, but it falls short of the effective maximum of 99 watt-hours (the result of FAA regulations on the size of batteries allowed in carry-on electronics).&nbsp;</p>



<p>To offset this, the Legion 5i supports Nvidia Optimus switchable graphics. This can turn off the more power-hungry Nvidia GPU and fall back to Intel integrated graphics to conserve power. However, it doesn&rsquo;t achieve great results.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Legion 5i battery life" class="wp-image-1373895" height="734" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/lenovo-legion-5i-battery-life.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The Legion 5i delivered under five hours of battery life, a figure that puts it slightly behind the pack. This result is in line or below some laptops that don&rsquo;t offer Optimus. That is a disappointing result. It may be the case that Optimus is not engaging correctly. With that said, the Nvidia&rsquo;s GPU activity monitor didn&rsquo;t indicate the GPU was engaged during our battery life test.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s clear the Legion 5i isn&rsquo;t the best choice for battery life. It&rsquo;s a powerful and power-hungry laptop with a modestly sized battery. Expect to top off the laptop frequently.</p>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The Lenovo Legion 5i is a competent mid-range gaming laptop that struggles to throw aside the compromises its affordable pricing demands. It does the job, but it&rsquo;s a bit boring.</p>



<p>Performance is the highlight. Mid-range gaming laptops often perform well for their price and the Legion 5i seems a bit ahead of this already impressive pack. This is as quick a gaming laptop as you&rsquo;ll find without upgrading to RTX 3070 or RTX 3080 hardware, something you&rsquo;ll only find in laptops that are at least a few hundred dollars more expensive. However, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/700135/acer-nitro-5-review-a-gamers-gaming-laptop.html">Acer&rsquo;s Nitro 5</a> is a slightly better value, offering almost identical performance for even less.</p>



<p>The rest of the laptop is a cost-effective shell for the hardware. Aside from its connectivity, which is excellent, nothing about the laptop&rsquo;s quality or feature set puts it ahead of the crowd. But with an as-tested price of $1,549.99 and some almost identical hardware configurations dipping to $1,399.99, that&rsquo;s a compromise many gamers will be willing to accept.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of the budget models, you&rsquo;ll have to decide between a higher-resolution and/or larger screen (easier on the eyes) versus the price. We really don&rsquo;t consider the SSD storage space to be a deciding factor, save for storing games. We&rsquo;ve included the HP Chromebook 14 in the budget category because its Celeron N4120 is a quad-core processor that should offer substantially more performance than the dual-core N4020 Chromebooks, even if the display resolution and memory is skimpier than we&rsquo;d like.</p>

Strongly consider it, as well as the QLED tech that drives the TCL 55-inch model from Amazon.</p>



<p>The two Samsung TU690T displays prioritize screen size. Sony&rsquo;s 4K Full Array XR65X90K is priced a bit higher, but its full-array local dimming is a compromise between an LED-lit TV and OLED, and will simply look a bit better than the other budget TVs&mdash;it&rsquo;s also at an all-time low price. </p>



<p>We also like the Hisense U7H, as it also offers local dimming, a 120Hz refresh rate, and has some newer features that include an absolutely brilliant backlight that can improve HDR viewing.</p>

The refresh rate is how quickly a monitor can pull up a new image. So, at 260Hz, visuals on this monitor should look extremely smooth.</p>
