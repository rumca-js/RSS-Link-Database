<p>Google Sheets lets you design spreadsheets with sophisticated features, and one of the most useful to know is dropdown lists. You can add a dropdown list to a cell (or to a range of cells), and when you or another person with access to your spreadsheet clicks the cell, a dropdown will open that shows a list of numbers or words that they can select. The number or word that’s selected will then appear inside the cell.</p><p>Some use case examples:</p><ul>
<li>You need co-workers to enter very specific numbers or words into your spreadsheet. Providing dropdown lists makes this more convenient for them and eliminates the risk of mistyped entries.</li>
<li>You add a dropdown list containing number presets that immediately change a chart embedded on your spreadsheet.</li>
<li>You create a spreadsheet to track a project, in which co-workers select their work progress status from a dropdown list.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can create two kinds of dropdown lists in Google Sheets: The first lists specific numbers or words that you’ve entered as preset choices, while the second lists data that currently appears in a range of cells in your spreadsheet. This guide walks you through the basic steps of creating both types of dropdowns and adding color to them.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3677859/google-sheets-how-to-use-dropdown-lists.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
