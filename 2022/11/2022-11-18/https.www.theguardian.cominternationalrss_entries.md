<p>Argentina’s head coach on bringing Lionel Messi back into the fold – and the pain of losing an FA Cup final with West Ham</p><p>‘The sun will come up tomorrow,” Lionel Scaloni says. The Argentina manager is talking about the “terrible burden of responsibility” he carried as a player, the weight he tries to free his footballers from now, when a moment comes to his mind. It happened in 2006, and you may remember it. He certainly does, the regret remaining even though it might have been the best mistake he ever made. Not destiny exactly and he couldn’t have known it then, but one of those events that somehow shape things, the ball as butterfly effect.</p><p>Seconds remained in the FA Cup final with West Ham on the verge of winning their first trophy in 26 years, only the fourth in their history, when it fell to Steven Gerrard and, Scaloni says, “the world came crashing down on me”. Liverpool’s captain hit an absurd shot and everything shifted. “I lost an FA Cup, it was partly my fault because I didn’t clear well, and life changed,” he recalls. “West Ham don’t want to sign me, I return to Spain. I wouldn’t have met my wife or had my kids.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/18/lionel-scaloni-when-you-play-for-argentina-that-grrr-is-always-there">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The All Blacks captain reflects on the inspiration found in an old family cigar and how facing South Africa can never be a friendly</p><p>There’s an old cigar in Caroline and Braeden Whitelock’s house, wrapped up somewhere safe in a drawer. Their son, Sam, can still remember the way it smelled to him when he was a kid. It was given to his grandad, Nelson Dalzell, as a reward for his man-of-the match performance when the All Blacks beat England 5-0 at Twickenham in 1954. Dalzell scored the only try, when he charged over England wing Ted Woodward. “We didn’t have a lot of stuff from grandad’s playing days,” says Whitelock – the jerseys were all thrown out after Sam’s uncle wore them thin – “but that cigar’s still at home. Mum and Dad always said they would smoke it if one of us became an All Black, but thankfully they never did.”</p><p>They had plenty of chances. Sam’s older brother, George, was capped in 2009, and so was his younger brother Luke, in 2013; the fourth, Adam has played for the national sevens side. Sam’s gone on to outstrip all of them, and almost everyone else. He has 142 caps now. Chances are that by this time next year he will be the most-capped All Black in history.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/18/sam-whitelock-twickenham-still-feels-like-it-has-a-bit-of-extra-spice">Continue reading...</a>

Yes, the Qataris wanted to ensure that fans of every nation, religion and creed feel comfortable at matches – and that wouldn’t be the case if some were boozed-up or blotto.

<p>Katherine Rundell has just become the youngest ever winner of the prestigious literary prize – for a biography of ‘poet of desire’ John Donne. Why is she giving the £50,000 away? Because, she says, no man is an island</p><p>When Katherine Rundell was growing up in Zimbabwe, her parents pinned a John Donne poem by the bathroom sink for their four children to read while they were brushing their teeth. “I do mean Go and Catch a Falling Star rather than To His Mistress Going to Bed,” laughs Rundell, seated in a London hotel. “It was age appropriate.” So began a love affair with Donne that took off in her late teens and led to her studying his poetry for a PhD – and now winning the Baillie Gifford prize for Super-Infinite, her biography of the poet and her second book for adults (she is the author of five children’s books). At 35, she is the youngest ever recipient of the prestigious award for nonfiction.</p><p>That the life of a 400-year-old metaphysical poet should beat shortlisted books about such issues as the migrant crisis and British colonialism is testament to the eloquence and passion of Super-Infinite. “This is both a biography of Donne and an act of evangelism,” Rundell tells the reader at the start. “I wanted to write something that will push people towards his poetry. My great hope was that I might put people in a position where they would be more readily able to unfurl what he’s doing, because he is famously difficult. And his difficulty has its own power and joy. He offers us a mode of living. He offers us a sense of what we might do with our minds. He offers a model of burning originality. And I love him for that.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/18/john-donne-roof-walking-trapeze-flying-baillie-gifford-winner-katherine-rundell">Continue reading...</a>

<p>One hundred years after the French writer’s death, translator Lucy Raitz suggests some good ways into his work</p><p>The long revered French novelist, critic and essayist is still thought to be one of the most influential authors of all time a century after this death on 18 November 1922. While Proust does have more than one work of fiction to his name - in 1896 he published the short story collection Les Plaisirs et Les Jours (Pleasures and Days), for example, and between 1895 and 1899 he wrote the autobiographical novel Jean Santeuil – when people refer to Proust they tend to be talking about A la Recherche du Temps Perdu (In Search of Lost Time). Perhaps you’ve dipped in to one of the monumental novel’s seven volumes, or maybe you’ve struggled to find a way in; either way, literary translator Lucy Raitz has put together this handy guide to the great writer for anyone who wants to know his work better.</p><p>***</p><p>They buried him, but all through the night of his funeral, in the lit shop-windows, his books, in groups of three, kept watch like angels with outstretched wings, and seemed, for him who was no longer there, the symbol of his resurrection.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/18/where-to-start-with-marcel-proust-french-writer">Continue reading...</a>

I’d have got 5,000 words out of the plane flight alone.</p><p>Fast forward to the present day, then, and I am nearly disappointed not to be seeing one of the great horrors of the sporting/geopolitical age in inglorious technicolor.

<p>Baked apples stuffed with buttered dates, roasted in earl grey tea and served with a no-fuss ice-cream – winter cooking at its best</p><p>Baked apples fill the kitchen with the most beautiful scent. Recently an old friend who is trying to sell his home told me that he was considering making an apple crumble before people came to view it; he had heard that the smell of baked comforts can help. I told him these baked apples would work just as well. The jamminess of the dates stuffed inside the fruit brings a welcome bit of texture, and you can scoop it up with the melted ice-cream that gathers in the bottom of your bowl.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/nov/18/whole-roast-apples-no-churn-ice-cream-recipe-ravneet-gill">Continue reading...</a>

## Jazz, Nazis and Bryan Ferry: how Babylon Berlin became TV’s most decadent drama

<p>It’s the most expensive – and most successful – German drama ever made. As its brilliant portrait of the tragic hedonism of 1930s Berlin reaches a season finale, the team behind it tell its tale</p><p>Babylon Berlin is the most expensive German television drama ever made. It’s also the most successful, with its depiction of Weimar Republic-era Berlin having been shown in more than 100 countries worldwide. Since its early seasons this detective noir show has exploded with colour, razzle-dazzle, danger and sweeping set pieces, and it has now spent five years vividly bringing to life a decade-long flash of chaotic democracy that ended in economic turmoil, corruption and, ultimately, fascism. With its superb opening titles, breathless, trippy pace and extravagant song-and-dance numbers – last season even saw a turn from Bryan Ferry, singing a German jazz version of his song Bitter-Sweet – heady, dangerous times have never been better depicted.</p><p>This season, the feel of the show has become even more menacing. Since its October launch on Sky Atlantic, UK viewers have been given a darker, wintry vision of Berlin, its smoky streets lined with the dishevelled and desperate victims of the 1929 crash. The Nazis are no longer lurking menacingly in the wings, but are violently taking centre stage. Lead detective Gereon Rath, played by Volker Bruch, has found himself uncomfortably close to Hitler’s militant supporters as he undertakes a secret assignment to infiltrate the National Socialist party. As the city descends into chaos, all the dancing and hedonism takes on a new poignancy, as it becomes clear that decadence is now a last, desperate refuge from the dreadful world outside the ballrooms. At one point, we see one of the show’s lead characters – flapper girl and sex worker-turned-aspiring-detective<strong> </strong>Charlotte “Lotte” Ritter, played by Liv Lisa Fries – nearly lose her job when she tries to help her homeless sister. The city depicted is one of broken dreams, shattered hopes and lives on the edge.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/18/how-babylon-berlin-became-tvs-most-decadent-drama">Continue reading...</a>

Over its three years of development, the game went from a Prince of Persia spin-off curio to the gem in the publisher’s forthcoming games list. It became the talk of the industry in 2006 after a well-constructed trailer teased at the imaginations of gamers and history fanatics alike.

The high-profile appointment of producer Jade Raymond made headlines and by the time Assassin’s Creed was nearing completion, Ubisoft had committed more than 150 staff to make sure the finished product was as polished and impressive as it could be. But as the development team swelled and the Holy Land started to take shape, there was just one man working on the soundtrack: Jesper Kyd.</p><p>In the beginning, there was talk about hiring multiple composers because Ubisoft didn’t really feel that any one composer could pull this off… They found, in me, someone that could do all of it</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/nov/18/scholars-symphonies-and-rave-music-making-the-assassins-creed-soundtrack-">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Buffalo City on edges of Lake Erie and Watertown on Lake Ontario among areas deluged with huge snowfall</p><p>A major lake-effect snow event has hit the Great Lakes region of the US, causing intense and paralysing snowfall. It started on Wednesday evening, and will probably carry on until the end of the weekend with the worst-affected places being Buffalo City on the eastern edges of Lake Erie, and areas around Watertown on Lake Ontario.</p><p>Lake-effect snow occurs when cold air blows across an unfrozen lake that is relatively warm, heating the cold air from below and creating heavy snow showers. These showers often form in narrow quasi-stationary bands causing significant amounts of snow to fall over a small area. This current event is caused by cold air sourced from Canada, blowing cyclonically around low-pressure located above the Great Lakes, becoming a returning south-westerly or westerly flow depending on location.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/18/weather-tracker-great-lakes-region-of-us-hit-by-lake-effect-snow">Continue reading...</a>

<p>To Republicans, Pelosi has long taken on a kind of mythic malice. But progressives, too, were not enamored of her</p><p>As the new House Republican majority stumbles into power, with all the chaotic, embittered bumbling of a rich man’s son who can only seem to fail upwards, another, peculiar kind of political transition is taking place: Nancy Pelosi, 82, is leaving the House speakership, almost certainly for the last time.</p><p>Perhaps no individual has come to symbolize the Democrats more to the people who do not like the party. To Republicans, Pelosi has long taken on a kind of mythic malice. To the Fox-watching white male, Pelosi symbolizes liberal elitism, a vague but totalizing specter of corruption, and that particular kind of liberal decadence that can be evoked by the name of the city that makes up nearly all of her longtime congressional district: San Francisco. She’s a woman in power, and she’s long been supportive of gay rights, and she opposed the Iraq war. She’s been a reliable opponent of conservatives’ favorite culture war crusades: she supports gun control and opposes Confederate statues. In an association facilitated by misogyny, her very face is a shorthand for liberal extremism, a visual code that denotes secularism, taxation and frightening new pronouns.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/18/nancy-pelosi-hate-figure-right-left-political-virtuoso">Continue reading...</a>

## John Herdman: the mastermind who has led Canada to the men’s and women’s World Cups

<p>The Englishman will complete an extraordinary journey with Canada in Qatar. And those who have played under him are quick to praise his motivational skills</p><p>John Herdman stands in front of a yellow conference room wall, shifting his weight from one foot to the other, off to the side of a projector screen. It displays a quote from Sun Tzu in one corner and a dramatic description of a wildfire along the bottom. He leans into the latter.<br /><br />“It gains a terrifying momentum. That’s what it gains – a terrifying momentum. This red shirt, this team,” the Canada manager tells his players. “It consumes everything in its path: Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Aruba, Suriname … and then you’ll be ready. What a fucking journey.”<br /><br />If the identities of the four teams in that path somewhat detract from the speech, they really shouldn’t. This is the world that Canada’s men’s national team were operating in just a year and a half ago. Next week Herdman, an Englishman who has become a hero in Canada, will send his team out to face Belgium in the country’s first men’s World Cup match for nearly four decades. <br /><br />The speech is one of the first stirring moments <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/wecan">from WeCAN</a>, a behind-the-scenes series charting Canada’s rollicking run through Concacaf qualifying en route to Qatar. There are plenty more. But in truth, this is all merely part of the journey.<br /><br />Just one Canadian player was born before Mexico 86, the last time the country played on the game’s grandest stage – indomitable skipper Atiba Hutchinson who turns 40 in February. Much is rightly made of the rawness and inexperience of the team he captains. But Herdman, the 47-year-old former teacher from Durham, does not lack for experience. Qatar, remarkably, will be the fourth senior World Cup of a management career that started in earnest 16 years ago.<br /><br />Herdman talks about history as something to be torn up or rewritten, to be challenged or made and remade. When asked last week what it meant to him to be the first manager ever to take a team to a men’s and women’s World Cup, he spoke of how pivotal it is to be “practicing what I preach”.<br /><br />The preaching is, and appears to have always been, the key part of Herdman’s practice. Spend time with any of those who he’s brought with him on his journey from skills camps in northern England and doubters at the Sunderland Academy to grassroots roles in New Zealand that turned to national team jobs there and in Canada, and the talk always comes back to the talk. Herdman is a master of motivation.<br /><br />“John is built for these kind of tournaments,” says Melissa Tancredi, the former Canadian stalwart who played under Herdman at the 2015 Women’s World Cup. “He’s been through it all. He’s been through one at home [in Canada] when we all felt that pressure so I don’t think that there’s any inexperience with John.</p><p>“This man has something that most managers don’t and that’s his ability to actually connect with players and get the absolute best out of them. He’s a mastermind. I’ve never had, or heard of, a coach who is able to connect with players like he does. He’s an absolute beauty in terms of a motivator. He has that ability to calm the situation or bring it to where he needs to bring it, he’s a calibrator. You don’t really learn that, it’s something you’re innately given.”<br /><br />While Herdman has undoubtedly grown as a tactician during his years in the international game, Tancredi’s argument that the psychological and cultural skills were a feature from the jump is backed up by those who were there at the start.<br /><br />Wendi Henderson was long since retired from the New Zealand national team and was feeling her way back into club football, initially for fun, in 2006 when someone approached her on the sidelines in Wellington.<br /><br />“It was John Herdman. He said he’d just been appointed as Football Ferns manager and asked: ‘Where are you at?’” Henderson says. “I started laughing. ‘Where am I at? I’m 35 and retired three years ago!’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/18/john-herdman-canada-soccer-coach-world-cup-qatar-2022">Continue reading...</a>

## Wild by Amy Jeffs audiobook review – otherworldly tales from medieval Britain

<p>The author’s folksongs add a new dimension to these evocative short stories inspired by objects and texts from medieval times</p><p>In Wild, tThe writer and medievalist Amy Jeffs blends fact and fiction to “evoke and contextualise [Britain’s] ancient imaginative landscape”. Broadly covering the years 600-1000, a period of “migration, conversion and belief in monsters, demons, angels and omens in the sky”, the book comprises seven themed chapters: Earth, Ocean, Forest, Beast, Fen, Catastrophe and Paradise. Each begins with a short story inspired by objects or texts that have survived from early medieval times, and are rooted in their surroundings, after which Jeffs takes a closer look at the sources.</p><p>The first chapter opens with a ghost story, The Lament of Hos, in which a woman rises from her earthy resting place to revisit the site of her violent demise; there she was supposed to meet her lover, Ertae, but instead encountered a group of men, “their breath all drink and eels”, who beat and killed her. The inspiration for this shimmering tale is an Old English poem The Wife’s Lament, which features in the Exeter Book, a 10th-century anthology of verse, often known as the Old English Elegies, which is one of the largest surviving collections of early medieval literature (several of the original poems feature in Wild’s appendix).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/18/wild-by-amy-jeffs-audiobook-review-otherworldly-tales-from-medieval-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A dancer, choreographer and director who made her stage debut aged three, Toye was a creative powerhouse who left an estimable legacy as a film director. Now two of her films are being released for a new audience</p><p>There are few figures in British film history as fascinating as Wendy Toye. Born in east London in 1917, she was a showbiz prodigy who first appeared on stage aged three at the Royal Albert Hall. Later, she was a dancer, choreographer and director working across stage and film, and responsible for some of British cinema’s most beguiling and chilling flights of fantasy – as well as some beloved comedies. All that a time when women were rarely entrusted with the director’s chair. “Then, I liked it to be forgotten that my films were made by a woman,” she said in 1990. “I think nowadays I’d feel quite differently.”</p><p>For a remarkably long stretch, Toye had the knack of meeting the right people at the right time and place. It helped that she had such a prodigious talent. She choreographed her first ballet at the Palladium, in London aged nine. She sat in on the rehearsals of Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes, and later joined the Markova-Dolin Ballet Company as a soloist and was taken under the wing of Dame Ninette de Valois. She soon became a prolific choreographer for the stage, achieving so much at such a young age that the dance critic Caryl Brahms was prompted to call her, among other accolades, the “Grand Young Grandmother of the dance routineers”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/18/backed-by-the-butter-board-then-a-cannes-premiere-rediscovering-the-films-of-wendy-toye">Continue reading...</a>

While studying jazz at New Hampshire’s<strong> </strong>Dartmouth College, an institution founded to train Native Americans as Christian missionaries, they found field recordings of Abenaki songs and stories locked away in the archives. On Sweet Tooth, Obomsawin repatriates some of the music of their people, and their responses to it, into a suite of resistance.</p><p>Sweet Tooth begins with Odana, an arrangement of an early 18th-century Abenaki ballad. Telling the story of Obomsawin’s village’s founding, their voice is deep, beautiful and powerful, accompanied by brass and shimmering, rolling percussion. Lineage follows, an original composition, evoking the period of more than 12,000 years that passed before the arrival of Europeans on Wabanaki land. Then comes the extraordinary Wawasint8da, based on a translation of a Jesuit hymn, brought into the community by a priest intent on indoctrination. Obomsawin wraps its melody around an Abenaki mourning song, Sami’metwehu, before the track surges into three minutes of thrilling free jazz.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/18/mali-obomsawin-sweet-tooth-review">Continue reading...</a>

In the wrong hands, an “up in the club / together we are one” lyric can feel trite, but in the manicured talons of Honey Dijon, the meta-mood of house becomes monumental.</p><p>In the past decade the Chicago-born, New York-sculpted DJ has ascended from fashion party favourite to Ibiza resident to Lady Gaga remixer; in recent years, she’s collaborated with Comme des Garcons on a high-end fashion line and produced songs on Beyoncé’s Renaissance. Where her debut album, 2017’s The Best of Both Worlds, played it deep and groovy, its follow-up is an anthemic and vocal-heavy celebration of Black queer identity, with twice the style and oodles more personality.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/18/honey-dijon-black-girl-magic-review">Continue reading...</a>

## Disenchanted review – Amy Adams returns for engaging, if lesser, sequel

<p>A follow-up to 2007’s charming fish-out-of-water musical fantasy can’t quite recapture the magic</p><p>Two years after Amy Adams broke out and secured an Oscar nomination for her dizzy, disarming turn in modest indie Junebug, she found a way to smartly parlay that same wide-eyed ebullience to a much grander stage. Disney caper Enchanted was a canny, crowd-pleasing charmer that stood as proof of Adams’ warm movie star appeal while also managing to stand out in a busy post-Shrek crowd of progressively grating fairytale meta snark.</p><p>The sequel, Disenchanted, is landing on Disney+ rather than in cinemas suggesting, yes, ongoing corporate greed, but also an understandable wariness over how a 15-year gap might have affected audience interest. As well-received as the film was back at the time (a $340m global gross and a 93% positive rating from critics), it’s not something that’s necessarily had a visible cultural imprint and Adams has moved away from comedy to more serious fare, most recently in a string of reviled lumps of failed Oscarbait, from Hillbilly Elegy to The Woman in the Window to Dear Evan Hansen (her last hit as a lead was 2016’s Arrival). While there might be a predictably substantial downturn in quality from film to film, it’s still a shrewd move for Adams, a breath of fresh air for someone who’s been stuck in the murk.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/18/disenchanted-review-amy-adams-returns-sequel">Continue reading...</a>

But to Dave Watson, it’s more than just background noise: it’s a lifestyle. The 55-year-old has been collecting copies of UK No 1 hits since the late 1980s; today, he owns all 1,404 UK No 1 singles, reaching back to the birth of the charts in 1952. He believes it’s the only complete collection of its kind.</p><p>Watson’s devotion to the charts began when he was given a Guinness Book of Hit Singles one Christmas.
