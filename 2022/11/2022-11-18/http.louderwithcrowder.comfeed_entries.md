	We've been <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-twitter-all-hands" target="_blank">saying this since June</a>, and Elon Musk's tweet today is a reminder. Owning the libs is fun, but let's dial back the hero worship. While it's great that he brought back <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/babylon-bee-reinstated" target="_blank">The Babylon Bee</a> and Jordan Peterson, his announcement in doing so left a lot to be desired.
</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
		New Twitter policy is freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach.<br />
<br />
		Negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted & demonetized, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter. <br />
<br />
		You won’t find the tweet unless you specifically seek it out, which is no different from rest of Internet.<br />
		— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1593673339826212864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2022</a>
</blockquote></div><p>Dude, throttling (or reducing reach) is the problem. That the rest of the internet does it now IS the f*cking problem. They throttle what the EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY think are "negative" and/or 'hate." And more often than not <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/10/31/social-media-disinformation-dhs/" target="_blank">it's defined by the Biden Administration</a>.</p><p> We saw the leaked Slack messages over the summer about yeeting Libs of TikTok off of the platform. Elon saw them, too, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-twitter-libs-tiktok" target="_self">because he commented and came to her defense</a>.</p><p>People who work for Twitter, Facebook, etc. thought Hunter Biden's laptop, any question about election results, any question about a public health crisis, and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-maher-babylon-bee-twitter" target="_self">getting the gender wrong of a Biden</a> official were all "outrageous." Does Elon agree with limited reach for those opinions?</p><p>In June, Biden's climate advisor demanded Big Tech <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-climate-advisor-tech-companies-censor-disinformation-promote-benefits-clean-energy" target="_blank">start censoring what she called "disinformation" about clean energy</a>. Like, say, all of Joe Biden's policies that may or may not be causing skyrocketing gas prices. Or criticizing skyrocketing gas prices. Does Elon Musk, who owns an electric vehicle company, agree any of those "outrageous" opinions should have limited reach?</p><p>Who defines what's "negative" or "hate" not that Elon Musk takes control? The problem now is the people who define it now do so based on their ultra-radical woke political agenda and/or what their allies in the Democratic Party tell them.</p><p>He needs to clarify. Musk owning Twitter holds promise. It's not like the bird app can suck more, and I can't get enough of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ligma-johnson-rising" target="_blank">Ligma</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-rehires-ligma" target="_blank">Johnson</a>. But it could wind up being "meet the new boss, same as the old boss." Just with more edgelord memes.</p><p><p>

## It's finally happened: Elon Musk has REINSTATED the Babylon Bee's Twitter account

But the person in charge of putting together the committee was accidentally fired along with everyone else. So Elon said, "F*ck it, bring back The Bee!"</p><p>That's the story as has been told to us by an unnamed source close to the matter who wishes to remain anonymous. The important thing is The Babylon Bee has their account back.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">We're back. Let that sink in.<br />— The Babylon Bee (@TheBabylonBee) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBabylonBee/status/1593671784666402816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The account was always there. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rachel-levine-babylon-bee-twitter" target="_blank">They were just prevented from accessing it unless they deleted a tweet that made fun of a Biden administration official</a>. People who used to work at Twitter deemed it to be hateful. It wasn't hateful enough for Twitter to delete it themselves. The tweet's been up this entire time. It was only hateful enough for Twitter to make the Bee delete it for them.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://t.co/NBby4W7COp">pic.twitter.com/NBby4W7COp</a><br />— The Babylon Bee (@TheBabylonBee) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBabylonBee/status/1504155537008697352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 16, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Personally, I don't get the joke. Assistant Health Secretary Admiral Rachel Levine is clearly a woman as defined by the AP Styleguide. But humor is subjective. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ligma-johnson-rising" target="_blank">Not everyone gets Ligma Johnson</a> either.</p><p>Legend has it that this suspension for mocking a political figure is what set the ball in motion and led to Elon Musk setting a pile of money on fire to buy Twitter. The same anonymous source from before played us the phone call.</p><blockquote>ELON MUSK: Did Twitter really suspend you for that?<br /><br />BABYLON BEE: Yes.<br /><br />ELON MUSK: Well that's stupid.</blockquote><p>World Wars were started for less. </p><p>The Babylon Bee remains the most trusted name in the news when their clear parodies become reality months later. Though if the bee has their account back, it makes you wonder who is next...</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## Watch: Conservative Matt Gaetz names four simple issues we can find common ground with progressives on

I say "in theory" because not everyone in the GOP caucus is willing to vote for Kevin McCarthy for speaker and the margin is thin. One of the anti-Kevins is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matt-gaetz-abortion-protest" target="_blank">Rep. Matt Gaetz</a>. The caucus has the next month and a half to fight it out. But whether it is Speaker McCarthy or Speaker Whoever, they'd be smart to listen to Gaetz as he lays out four BIPARTISAN bills that should be the first orders of business.</p><p>Yes, we're told we need to find common ground. The people who tend to tell us that also tends to mean conservatives should shut up and embrace whatever the left believes in that week. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/abortion-protesters-indiana" target="_blank">Matt Gaetz</a> lays out four things EVERYONE should agree on, and even claims to have Democrats' support. (shout out <a href="https://notthebee.com/article/i-dare-you-to-disagree-with-anything-matt-gaetz-says-in-this-video" target="_blank">Not the Bee</a>)</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) on what he backs for next Congress, with Democratic support:<br /><br />• No campaign donations from federal lobbyists or PACs<br />• Ban on Congress members becoming lobbyists<br />• Ban on Congress members trading individual stocks<br />• Bills should include only 1 subject <a href="https://t.co/2uZeMMkL7r">pic.twitter.com/2uZeMMkL7r</a><br />— The Recount (@therecount) <a href="https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1592262677581090816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><ul><li>No campaign donations from federal lobbyists or PACs </li><li>Ban on Congress members becoming lobbyists </li></ul><p>Speaks for themselves.</p><ul><li>Ban on Congress members trading individual stocks</li></ul><p>It's not shocking we haven't gotten this done. The lady who used to be in charge is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/paul-pelosi-stock-masterclass" target="_blank">married to a guy who made his fortune (allegedly) doing this very thing</a>. But she's gone now. Anyone who doesn't support this in the House should be forced to explain to the American people why they don't on the floor of the House.</p><ul><li>Bills should include only one subject</li></ul><p>Quote the Gaetz: "Something that worked well in Florida, a bill coming to the floor should only deal with one subject. I was incensed as a freshman when I had to vote on the 'farm bill' and whether or not to authorize war in Yemen in the same vote."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="3f03c" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32121406&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Or a more green example, an Inflation Reduction Act full of things that have nothing to do with inflation or the act of reducing it. The "act" is that when people vote against it, their opponents campaign claiming that person "doesn't care about inflation."</p><p>New flash. There is a LOT that conservatives and progressives can come together on. They're little things that won't get you as much social media attention as the bigger things, but they're still things. Issues that, albeit indirectly, would have a positive effect on America. I hope Gaetz continues to lead on this.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Dude makes the mistake of crossing fast-food counter, catches a super-sized beatdown for his troubles

Sometimes it's by accident. Other times the employee is having a bad day. But we know in order to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mcdonalds-axe-smasher-origin-story" target="_blank">maintain a civilized society</a>, you control your emotions and stay on your side of the counter. Once you cross the counter, you're in their world now. And they've been waiting for an excuse.</p><p>Standard viral video disclaimers apply. Location and time of the event are unknown and allow for missing context. Maybe there was a good reason to leap over the counter. Like they said something about his mother, or that they think Joe Biden is a good president.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Don't fuck with fast food workers, they have nothing to lose! <a href="https://t.co/knxKndcVYb">pic.twitter.com/knxKndcVYb</a><br />— Old Row (@OldRowViral) <a href="https://twitter.com/OldRowViral/status/1593281642919071745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>I'd love to know what was going through the head of the guy who crossed the counter, other than fists and Timbs'. Whatever his reasoning, this ain't Chick-Fil-A bitch. If you have a problem, the employees aren't going to pray with you or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chick-fil-a-chokehold" target="_blank">save your baby from being kidnapped</a>. I say this as someone who once worked in fast food. 99.86% of us don't want to be there, hate being there, and in many instances hate our lives and ourselves.</p><p>Put yourself in my man working the 2-10 shift's shoes. He has no doubt gotten yelled at three times because the order took twelve seconds too long. He's had to clean the bathroom twice because customers are savages. And he only pours the self-serve ice cream. He's not a mechanic who can fix the machine. The guy doesn't have to work weekends.</p><p>Now he's got customers coming over the counter to disrespect him. Not this time. Not today. What f*cks he had left to give went out the window of the drive-thru at the woman holding up the line as she searched for change in her minivan's cup holder.</p><p>The fast food worker is the hero in this video. </p><p><p>

## Watch: School board says girls should accept biological male competitors since they won't amount to much anyway

If you are on the side of girls who used to be boys, "female athletes won't amount to anything" isn't the argument you think it is.</p><p>That's the argument of two FEMALE (I think they were born that way) school board members at the Central Bucks School District in Pennsylvania. The same state that elected John Fetterman.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">🧵Two Democrat members of the <a href="https://twitter.com/CBSDSchools?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CBSDSchools</a> board argue males should be able to compete in girls sports, suggesting winning isn’t important for high school girls. <br /><br />“Our philosophy is not about competition and who’s winning.

<p>The debate has no signs of slowing down.

It robs those girls (in the first group) of opportunities that could lead to scholarships and more. Also, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/locker-room-vermont-speaks-out" target="_blank">forcing young girls to change with classmates who have male body parts</a> is weird and people who support forcing them to do so should feel disgusted with themselves because you're a gross person. That is one side of the argument.</p><p>The other side of the argument thinks you're a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-teammate-speaks-out" target="_blank">homophobic transphobe</a>. Or even a transphobic homophobe. And they now think sports don't matter because, statistically speaking, your daughter won't amount to much anyway.</p><p>If competition in sports doesn't matter, there is no point in having organized sports.
