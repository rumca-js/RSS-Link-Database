Kayla first strutted into content glory when video of her and her comically larger fake chesticles (with even more comically larger fake nipples) was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/canadian-teacher-poolside" target="_blank">seen teaching high school students how to use a circular saw</a>. You may think that violates dress code, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shop-teacher-school-board-wins" target="_blank">but the school board told the haters to suck it</a>.</p><p>NOTE: We will be abiding by AP Styleguide and using she/her pronouns. I know that you know that I know that you know a) truth, b) science, and most importantly c) it's more hilarious that way.</p><p>To celebrate her huge win with the school board, Kayla and all her accessories decided to go skydiving. Citizen journalist Andy Ngo has more.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Breaking: New photos have emerged of Kayla Lemieux, the Toronto-area <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/trans?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#trans</a> teacher who went viral for wearing extra large prosthetic breasts at Oakville Trafalgar HS. Lemieux went skydiving with adult entertainer @/voodoopornstar (NSFW). <br /><br />Her wig was lost in the air. <a href="https://t.co/7KmCrzITHu">pic.twitter.com/7KmCrzITHu</a><br />‚Äî Andy Ng√¥ üè≥Ô∏èüåà (@MrAndyNgo) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1595719983887052800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The professional skydivers took extra care to ensure all of Kayla was properly strapped in.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>The other skydiving instructors couldn't believe they were sharing the cargo plane is such an internet celebrity. I'm sure their co-workers who had the day off were jealous. Shout out to my man throwing up the metal fingers.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="7c6f6" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=32209717&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Sadly, not all of Kayla made it in one piece. Don't worry. Her fake knockers were well-secured. But during the jump, she lost her wig. We regret to inform you that g-forces and gravity are both transphobic.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="23a13" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=32209725&amp;width=980" />

<p>Wait a second...is that Eddie Izzard?</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="9075d" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=32209726&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>There are rumors throughout the dark web that Kayla Lemieux is NOT the beautiful and brave teacher she appears to be. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shop-teacher-rumor" target="_blank">And that it's actually a dude pretending to see how far he can take it</a>. We at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website only follow the AP style guide. We are not as well versed in journalisming as the reporters at the Associated Press.  I know know what I see.</p><p>And what I see is a brave and beautiful teacher attempting to live her best authentic life. A best, authentic life where she was born with size HHH breasts. In this skydiving adventure, Kayla truly puts the "brave" in beautiful and brave.</p><p><p>

## Biden education official claims anything she doesn't like is 'white supremacy,' such as democracy and fatphobia

<p>Is the deputy director in the Office of Educational Technology at the Department of Education a vital part of the federal government? Meh.

## Elon Musk's recent tweets show he's about to expose everything we assumed Twitter was doing to conservatives

All the things conservatives were called paranoid about, not only was the left doing but they're in full meltdown over no longer being able to. NBC News sat down with a former Twitter employee who was recently fired. Her job was to "moderate" content.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Former content moderator employee at Twitter speaks out. Do you believe this person enforced twitter ToS fairly and equally for all persons?<br /><br /> <a href="https://t.co/3qverDTdPK">pic.twitter.com/3qverDTdPK</a><br />‚Äî John Curtis Ó®Ä (@Johnmcurtis) <a href="https://twitter.com/Johnmcurtis/status/1595415504742760448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>I feel as if this one particular employee was selected to be profiled by NBC News for a very specific reason.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Twitter, like every other social media platform (allegedly, some say, according to critics), was staffed with radical leftists who made it their "holy" quest to block/throttle/or otherwise deplatform anyone who disagrees with them about anything ever. I put "holy" in finger quotes because the only thing these people worship is themselves, Karl Marx, and Rep. AOC.</p><p>As Elon discovers how deep the problem went, he's been tweeting about it.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">It has been really bad. Far left San Francisco/Berkeley views have been propagated to the world via Twitter. <br /><br />I‚Äôm sure this comes as no surprise to anyone watching closely.<br /><br />Twitter is moving rapidly to establish an even playing field. No more thumb on the scale!<br />‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1595534031545765890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">It is objectively the case that ‚Äúconservative‚Äù political candidates were more negatively affected than ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù candidates.<br /><br />Anyone using Twitter knows this. Question is simply one of magnitude.<br />‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1595605877712642050?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The worst example is the Hunter Biden story. The explosive story <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-ceo-subpoena" target="_blank">was blocked to affect a presidential election</a>, on <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-twittter-gop-judiciary" target="_blank">the grounds it was "disinformation."</a> SPOILER: It wasn't "dis" information as much as it was the 100% accurate kind. What in a bygone era, our ancestors would refer to as "news."</p><p>Twitter was the worst about it (<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mark-zuckerberg-awesome-wonderful-man" target="_blank">according to Facebook</a>). Elon is promising a complete audit.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">This is necessary to restore public trust<br />‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1595637837969653760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>It's all being done to the dismay of "online experts" according to the Associated Press. Correct, the same AP that almost started World Warr III publishing fake news.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">But you have piqued my curiosity ‚Ä¶ who are these ‚Äúonline experts‚Äù you speak of?<br />‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1595976636088057857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>I maintain <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-skeptical-conservatives" target="_blank">my healthy skepticism</a>. But the worst-case scenario is that Twitter shuts down and we all move on with our lives. The best-case scenario is everything Elon Musk is doing resonates and starts to affect change on other platforms. By other platforms, I mean I'm looking at you Facebook.</p><p><p>
