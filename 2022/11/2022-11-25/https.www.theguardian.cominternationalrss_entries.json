Dance-theatre company Lost Dog\u2019s Christmas offering this year sounds distinctly un-festive. Ruination, by director-choreographer Ben Duke, is a reinterpretation of the myth of Medea, best known from Euripides\u2019 play, a sorceress who helps Jason steal the golden fleece from her father and takes off with him (murdering her own brother en route). But when Jason leaves her for another woman she kills her own two sons in a rage of revenge.<br /><br />At what point, I have to ask, did Duke think this was ideal Christmas fare? \u201cI think it was just a really childish kind of contrariness,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cSomeone says: \u2018Do a Christmas show\u2019, and then I go, \u2018What\u2019s the least Christmassy thing I can think of?\u2019 And it was Medea. But then I started thinking about it. If that\u2019s the opposite of Christmas, because it\u2019s about the death of children and Christmas is about the birth of a child, it started making sense to me.\u201d<br /><br />There was also the fact that it was Kevin O\u2019Hare, director of the Royal Ballet, who was having the conversation with Duke, looking for something to put on in the Royal Opera House\u2019s Linbury theatre. It\u2019s a space in the bowels of the building: you descend multiple staircases to get there, while the cheery evergreen Nutcracker will playing on the main stage above. \u201cSo it felt like a shadow world, a subconscious,\u201d says Duke. A trip to the underworld.</p><p><br />Duke, 47, has had a run of hits over the past seven years, taking well-known, much-retold stories and turning them inside out with meta commentaries that are witty, absurd and often deeply moving and truthful. There was his one-man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/may/27/paradise-lost-ben-duke-review-dance\">Paradise Lost</a>, rich with surreal tangents such as God trying to chat up Lucifer in a nightclub; it drew parallels between God\u2019s creation and Duke\u2019s experience of parenthood (he has two daughters), with neither entirely in control of what they\u2019ve made.

The expansive playing of Nick DiSalvo (vocals/guitar) and Mike Risberg (guitar/keys) is anchored by a sensitively virtuosic rhythm section as capable of deft complexity as pulverising heft. And while all five of the album\u2019s tracks are epic in length and aspiration, they also share a taut focus, a restless energy. Something is always happening, be it the serpentine groove and electrifying guitar crescendos of Endless Return, the elegant tidal force of The Purpose or the ever-shifting rhythms, mellotron textures and wild, synth-driven math-rock of Coalescence.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/25/elder-innate-passage-review-stickman\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/25/david-walliams-future-as-britains-got-talent-judge-up-in-the-air", "title": "David Walliams\u2019 future as Britain\u2019s Got Talent judge \u2018up in the air\u2019", "date_published": "2022-11-25 08:47:17+00:00", "description": "<p>BGT spokesperson says no decision made amid reports judge is stepping down after apology for \u2018disrespectful comments\u2019</p><p>David Walliams\u2019 future as a judge on Britain\u2019s Got Talent is \u201cvery much up in the air\u201d, a spokesperson for the ITV programme has said, amid reports he is leaving the show after 10 years.</p><p>Walliams apologised recently for making \u201cdisrespectful comments\u201d about contestants during the recording of an episode of the programme<strong>, </strong>following a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/10/david-walliams-recorded-derogatory-remarks-britains-got-talent-bgt-contestants\">Guardian report</a>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/25/david-walliams-future-as-britains-got-talent-judge-up-in-the-air\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/25/esbjorn-svensson-homes-review", "title": "Esbj\u00f6rn Svensson: HOME.S. review | John Fordham's jazz album of the month", "date_published": "2022-11-25 08:30:01+00:00", "description": "<p><strong>(ACT)<br /></strong>This recently discovered piano meditation from the modest maestro behind the Esbj\u00f6rn Svensson Trio will entrance fans and fascinate newcomers</p><p>When Esbj\u00f6rn Svensson made his UK debut at the 1999 Swedish Jazz Extravaganza festival, the then-34-year-old pianist/composer\u2019s jubilant fusions of Thelonious Monk, Ornette Coleman, Keith Jarrett and his own playful muse showed exactly why his reputation had begun to spread beyond Sweden. Within three years the pianist and his open-minded Esbj\u00f6rn Svensson Trio were touring the world, finding a new contemporary audience by merging classic jazz, catchy themes, intricate improv, classical music and rock-crescendo drama.</p><p>The story ended tragically nine years later when Svensson died in a scuba diving accident. He left behind a powerful EST back catalogue, augmented by the occasional unearthed live recording. HOME.S. is an uncharacteristic solo-piano meditation the artist made at home shortly before his death, only recently discovered by his widow, Eva. The influence of Jarrett\u2019s solo-piano method is audible, but Svensson\u2019s buoyancy, capriciousness of mood and sweeping melodic resources are all his own. He sometimes opens with dreamily wandering chords or treble-melody fragments, but also includes frisky contrapuntal dances and stately baroque sways. The gorgeous Gamma hints at bluesy soul resolutions that only coalesce at the song\u2019s close. Flying double-time freebop erupts out of gracefully interwoven left-right lines, while quiet harmonies turn to clanging soul-jazz chords pushed by rumbling bass-note boogies in the style of early Abdullah Ibrahim. Longtime Svensson fans will be entranced, and newcomers may catch a fascinated glimpse of why this modest maestro\u2019s early demise was such a loss to contemporary music.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/25/esbjorn-svensson-homes-review\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/nov/25/wales-v-iran-world-cup-2022-live", "title": "Wales v Iran: World Cup 2022 \u2013 live", "date_published": "2022-11-25 08:13:23+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>World Cup updates from the 10am GMT kick-off in Qatar</li><li>Any thoughts on the game?

The Seven Ages, from 2001 \u2013 a stunning reflection on human destiny \u2013 was preceded by both The Triumph of Achilles (1985) and Ararat (1990), for example, and followed by Averno (2005), named after the traditional site of the entrance to hell.

That\u2019s about all we know. Her husband, Keith, told police she had driven off in their car late that night, after a marital disagreement; the police strongly suspected Keith had killed her, but no trace of Pat Hall has ever been found. The case remains open, which means the two-part true-crime documentary The Confession (Prime Video) has a bewildering, frustrating tale to tell.</p><p>Episode one chalks up the circumstantial evidence. At first, the police assume that either a body or a sign that Pat is alive will turn up, with the former, grim explanation seen as more likely \u2013 especially when a witness reports having seen an unidentifiable figure hop out of the Halls\u2019 car on the night in question, leap over a fence carrying an unidentifiable object and disappear into woodland. Then, interviews with neighbours and relatives start to paint a dark picture. Neighbours say the row between Keith and Pat was audibly vociferous, but then stopped suddenly, with the sound of the car speeding off following a little later. Pat\u2019s friend claims that, three months earlier, she had rung to say Keith had lost his temper and placed his hands around her neck, before relenting.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/25/the-confession-review-youll-study-every-gesture-in-this-true-crime-documentary\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/25/british-man-deported-denmark-post-brexit-rules", "title": "British man to be deported from Denmark under post-Brexit rules", "date_published": "2022-11-25 06:00:49+00:00", "description": "<p>Will Hill says he was not told of 31 December 2021 deadline for residency application and his wedding plans are now in doubt</p><p>A British man is being deported from Denmark because he did not know he had to apply to stay in the country after Brexit.</p><p>Will Hill, 37, was ordered to leave by Sunday.
