What\u2019s less common is mini-LED backlighting, where an array of tiny lamps are used to illuminate the TV\u2019s LCD display panel.</p><p>As with quantum dots, different TV brands use different terms to indicate the presence of mini-LED backlighting in their sets \u2013 Samsung calls its mini-LED models \u201cNeo QLED\u201d, because the mini-LEDs are always combined with its QLED tech.</p><p>A key advantage mini-LED offers over regular LED TVs is that the smaller lamp modules used in the backlight allow for finer control over local dimming. That\u2019s a process where the individual modules are grouped in zones and dimmed according to the brightness level of the onscreen image. For example, the LED zones in shadowy parts of the picture will be dimmed or shut off completely, while bright highlight areas get a full blast of light.</p><p>With a higher density of LED modules spread across the backlight, mini-LED TVs can also deliver higher overall brightness, with some sets like <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-qn95b-neo-qled-4k-tv\"><u>Samsung\u2019s QN95B</u></a> having twice as much or more measured light output as regular LED-lit TVs. That Samsung model is the company\u2019s top-of-the-line 4K Neo QLED offering, but you get fantastic brightness from the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-qn85b-55qn85b\">Samsung QN85B</a> too.</p><p>Where that extra light output will matter is if you\u2019re going to be watching in a well-lit room \u2013 daytime sports viewing, for example. But it can also help bring out the full level of highlight detail in HDR sources by reducing the need for tone mapping, a process where the TV scales the brightness range of programs to accommodate its maximum light output capability.</p><p>To sum up, mini-LED can make a difference when viewing in rooms with bright lighting conditions, and it also adds a welcome level of visual punch when watching movies and TV shows with HDR. It\u2019s a feature you\u2019ll pay extra for, but for some folks it will be well worth it.</p>\n                                                            </article>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.techradar.com/rss", "link": "https://www.techradar.com/news/linkedin-is-finally-adding-this-really-obvious-feature", "title": "LinkedIn is finally adding this really obvious feature", "date_published": "2022-11-25 14:06:07+00:00", "description": "Social media managers rejoice, you can now schedule LinkedIn posts for a later time.", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.techradar.com/rss", "link": "https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-reigns-supreme-in-discrete-gpus-but-is-that-bad-news-for-consumers", "title": "Nvidia reigns supreme in discrete GPUs \u2013 but is that bad news for consumers?", "date_published": "2022-11-25 13:45:15+00:00", "description": "AMD is flailing badly in terms of graphics card market share \u2013 will it be down to Intel to challenge Nvidia eventually?", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.techradar.com/rss", "link": "https://www.techradar.com/news/the-cheapest-black-friday-vpn-deal-just-dropped-get-purevpn-for-just-dollar120-per-month", "title": "The cheapest Black Friday VPN deal just dropped: get PureVPN for just $1.13/pm", "date_published": "2022-11-25 13:04:14+00:00", "description": "PureVPN has just launched the best Black Friday VPN deal of this year \u2013 bag yourself a bargain on a range of different plans.", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.techradar.com/rss", "link": "https://www.techradar.com/news/black-friday-laptop-deals-under-dollar299", "title": "Black Friday Laptop Deals Under $299", "date_published": "2022-11-25 12:52:03+00:00", "description": "Black Friday is here and we're rounding up the best budget laptop deals under $299.", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.techradar.com/rss", "link": "https://www.techradar.com/news/live/black-friday-laptop-deals-live-macbooks-chromebooks-and-more", "title": "Black Friday laptop deals live: MacBooks, Chromebooks and more", "date_published": "2022-11-25 11:37:04+00:00", "description": "After the best Black Friday laptop deals?
