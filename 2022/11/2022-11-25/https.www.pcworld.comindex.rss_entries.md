<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>It can be difficult to find an inexpensive Thunderbolt dock, but this Black Friday offers two that we think are worth buying: the $216 Cable Matters 14-in-1 Thunderbolt Dock and the $159 Plugable 13-in-1 USB-C Docking Station.</p>



<p>Technically, the latter <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Charging-DisplayPort-Compatible-Thunderbolt/dp/B09TQY97M&amp;xcust=2-2-1394947-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Plugable 13-in-1 USB-C dock</a> uses the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/801587/why-new-usb-c-displaylink-docks-are-better-and-worse-than-thunderbolt.html">DisplayLink protocol</a>, a USB-C dock that uses compression to approximate the performance of a Thunderbolt dock. But we&rsquo;ve been impressed with the performance of DisplayLink docks across a variety of products, including Plugable&rsquo;s own products. We haven&rsquo;t yet reviewed the Plugable 13-in-1 USB-C docking station, but we&rsquo;re confident that it should live up to the standards that have helped Plugable products reach the top of our list of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">best Thunderbolt docks</a>. Unfortunately, many of those are priced well north of $300, and even close to $400.</p>



<p>What we like most about both the Plugable as well as the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-107044-Computer-Stations/dp/B08L9TCY25/&amp;xcust=2-2-1394947-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Cable Matters Hybrid 14-in-1 Dock</a> is that both manufacturers believe in a variety of display ports. HDMI? DisplayPort? No problem. Both docks include options for both display ports, <em>and</em> for both monitors. That&rsquo;s terrific flexibility, and even better news if you&rsquo;re buying these docks as a gift &mdash; whoever receives it won&rsquo;t have to buy an additional dongle or worry about which cable goes where.</p>



<p>Both of these docks offers substantial charging options, too. The Cable Matters dock supplies a rated 96W, and the Plugable dock provides 100W. That&rsquo;s more than enough for most USB-C powered laptops, though some recent gaming laptops may be an exception. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll find a vast variety of ports that should accommodate legacy devices. Both docks are 36 percent off. Great prices, great docks: a solid Black Friday deal.</p>

## Simplify your chores with this $99 Black Friday special on a robot vacuum

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Our robot overlords are supposed to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator&amp;xcust=2-1-1394891-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">rise against us</a> in several years, but until then, we can benefit their cleaning help. And right now, that assistance is cheaper than ever, thanks to a Walmart Black Friday deal on the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Anker-eufy-25C-Wi-Fi-Connected-Robot-Vacuum-Great-for-Picking-up-Pet-Hairs-Quiet-Slim/400599921&amp;xcust=2-1-1394891-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Anker eufy 25C Wi-Fi Robot Vacuum</a>. You can grab it for an ultra affordable $99, or a whopping 60 percent off.</p>



<p>This basic model handles just vacuuming, unlike much more expensive options that also do mopping. But for the price, this quiet little bot does a lot. It run up to 100 minutes at a time, and will automatically return to its base to recharge. It accepts commands by touch, from the companion smartphone app, or even your voice if you have an Alexa or Google Home compatible device. It even knows how to avoid falling down stairs.</p>



<p>The main &ldquo;issue&rdquo; with the eufy 25C is that it performs better on hard surfaces (e.g., wood floors) and as a budget vacuum, its navigation system isn&rsquo;t as sophisticated. You also have to clean it more frequently.</p>



<p>But for this stupendously low sale price, those are quibbles you could easily forgive. In exchange, you&rsquo;ll get a friendly assist with light cleaning to keep dust and dirt to minimum in between your deeper cleans. And it&rsquo;ll never shirk its duties or forget, either. At least, not until it joins a robot uprising.</p>

## This is the best Chromebook under $100 to buy on Black Friday

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>The best Chromebook under $100 to buy on Black Friday is the Lenovo Chromebook 3 11.6-inch on sale for $79 at Best Buy. It&rsquo;s a decent machine with acceptable compromises.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flenovo-chromebook-3-11-6-hd-laptop-celeron-n4020-4gb-memory-64gb-emmc-onyx-black%2F6500335.p&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow">$79 Lenovo Chromebook 3 (normally $139.00) at Best Buy</a> doesn&rsquo;t offer the flashiest discount, but it has the best combination of features that avoids the pitfalls that other retailers offer. It&rsquo;s one of the leading offers on our list of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1383937/black-friday-chromebook-deals-nov-25.html">the best Chromebook deals of Black Friday</a>, which also includes higher-priced but more full-featured options.</p>



<p>We prioritize 8GB of RAM, a large, detailed screen, and a relatively fast processor as the key attributes for a Chromebook. At under $100, these are rare. Lenovo&rsquo;s Chromebook 3 offers just 4GB of RAM and an 11-inch, 768p screen. But for the price, these are acceptable steps down. We also like the fact that the Chromebook 3 includes a Celeron N4020, a relatively modern dual-core chip, and Google support that only expires in 2026.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re going to warn you: there are other sites offering Chromebooks for this $79 price or less, especially Walmart. Beware of refurbished or &ldquo;recertified&rdquo; Chromebooks, and watch out for Chromebooks offering an N2840 or a Celeron N3000-esque processor inside. These were made several years ago, and just aren&rsquo;t worth the savings. </p>



<p>If your Chromebook budget is $100, we&rsquo;d ask that you try and squeeze an extra $20 out of it and opt for the <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-14-chromebook-intel-core-m3-8100y-4gb-memory-64gb-emmc-silver%2F6513085.p%3F&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow">$119 Asus 14-inch Chromebook</a> instead, on a massive 64% off sale at Best Buy. You&rsquo;ll get a <em>much</em> larger, better screen, and an improved processor. But if you can&rsquo;t, please choose the $79 Lenovo Chromebook 3 instead. It&rsquo;s easily the best sub-$100 Chromebook you&rsquo;ll find on Black Friday.</p>

## The Xbox Series S is $50 off on Black Friday. Includes a $50 gift card too!

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Graphics card prices may be falling at last, but they still can&rsquo;t beat the value of gaming consoles. Especially not when you can get up to 1440p gaming at a stunningly low price, thanks to a sweet Black Friday deal on the Xbox Series S. <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-s-8211-holiday-console%2F-%2FA-86908930&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=2-1-1384352-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Right now at Target</a>, $250 gets you the console <em>and</em> a bonus $50 Target gift card when you order online and choose in-store pickup.</p>



<p>If you shop at Target often (i.e., you&rsquo;d spend $50 on groceries or other goods in the future as a matter of course), this makes the effective price of the Xbox Series S just $200. That&rsquo;s 33 percent off the $300 MSRP and a smoking price. You can make it sweeter too, if you have a <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fredcard&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=2-1-1384352-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Target Red Card</a>&mdash;you can stack your usual 5% discount on top of this special.</p>



<p>In the box you&rsquo;ll get the console, plus a controller, power cable, and HDMI cable. As Microsoft&rsquo;s entry-level Xbox Series machine, the S has a smaller 512GB SSD and 10GB RAM, and lacks an optical drive. But it still plays games at high-quality 1080p and 1440p gaming, which is plenty for diving into the latest titles. Plus, given its all-digital nature, it pairs nicely with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397667/get-3-years-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-tip.html">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>



<p>Target lists this deal as available until Saturday, November 27th, and is only available for online orders. The $50 gift card will be applied when you pick it from the store. But as with all great deals, don&rsquo;t sit on this if you&rsquo;re interested. It could end early if stock runs out.</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Putting together a $500 gaming PC usually requires sacrifices. A creaky older graphics card is the big one, and often less memory and less storage, too. But not during Black Friday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building at this time of year is <em>great</em>. You can stack the deals to get nice parts at big discounts. The results put prebuilt desktops <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/p/3D5-000Z-000S1?Item=9SIA08CJJ14070&amp;xcust=2-2-1394611-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">in the same price range</a> to shame. Right now you can roll a system capable of 1080p Ultra at 60fps, with an easy path for future upgrades, for $500 or less. All the parts are new and are sold by first-party sellers only.</p>



<p>Have different needs? You can also move up to $700 for a 1440p build or scale down to under $400 for 720p, too. Just check out the example builds below.</p>

<p>This build doesn&rsquo;t cut corners unless you&rsquo;re trying to stick tight to $500 or below (the latter is a possibility if you live near a Micro Center). In fact, drop the graphics settings and you can go up to 1440p. You also get a sweet bonus of three free games, thanks to two AMD promotions.</p>

And yes, the Windows 10 license is included&mdash;no cheating here. (Full disclosure: I was tempted to.) The key comes from PCWorld&rsquo;s affiliated software store, so it&rsquo;s above board.</p>



<p>Oh, and again, this build also includes three bonus games (technically four). This is <em>a lot</em> for a build between $500 and $600. Remember the prebuilt mentioned above? That has a weaker lower core count processor, much weaker graphics card, half the memory (and slower memory at that), and no free software. This build smokes it, even without any RGB fans.</p>



<p>The main caveats? You need to flash the motherboard&rsquo;s BIOS to a newer version before the Ryzen 5 5500 will work in it. You can request a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/pa-105&amp;xcust=2-2-1394611-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">free loaner boot kit from AMD</a> for this purpose. A local computer shop may also be able to perform this service for a fee. (Or a good friend for free, if they like you.) This build also only supports PCIe 3.0, but SSDs and graphics card running at that standard&rsquo;s speeds will still be plenty fast for a long while.</p>

<p>At this price point, trimming corners with a cheaper CPU just doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Better to invest a little bit more money to future-proof with PCIe 4.0 support. And cutting down on memory and storage capacity feels stingy.</p>

<p>But as configured, it&rsquo;s somewhat limited. The power supply will restrict you to budget graphics cards, should you want to upgrade to a discrete GPU in the future.

<p>And before anyone asks, yes, I could have cut deeper. You can get under $300 by going down to 256GB storage and choosing a cheaper case with no front mesh panel. But that&rsquo;s asking people to suffer over the long haul, and I don&rsquo;t believe in that.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a lot to spend on a monitor, but the Odyssey Neo G9 is worth it even at full price. It&rsquo;s a massive 49-inch curved 5120&times;1440 display, the equivalent of running two standard 27-inch 1440p monitors side-by-side. But that&rsquo;s not all: Samsung&rsquo;s stunner also runs at a blistering 240Hz&mdash;four times faster than a standard 60Hz display, gamers&mdash;and comes infused with cutting-edge <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/560224/oled-vs-mini-led-the-pc-displays-of-the-future-compared.html">mini-LED technology that rivals OLED displays</a> in terms of image quality. Better yet, this is a quantum HDR2000 screen, so you&rsquo;ll get eye-searingly bright HDR visuals in compatible videos, games, and apps.</p>



<p>Add in wide 178-degree viewing angles, support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, VESA mounting options, and a picture-by-picture feature that takes full advantage of the ultra-wide width, and it&rsquo;s easy to see why Samsung normally charges $2,300 for this truly cutting-edge display. $1,500 is still by no means cheap, but saving $900 on one of the world&rsquo;s best monitors is a deal you don&rsquo;t want to miss if you can afford it.

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes, absolutely, you can find some great deals on monitors during the week of Black Friday&mdash;as evidenced by the great deals in the article above. Mind you, in some tech categories&mdash;like say, wireless earbuds or phone chargers&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see discounts on off-brand gear we&rsquo;d never recommend. But when it comes to monitors, highly reputable brands like HP, Dell, Samsung and Lenovo will drop prices on great models. PCWorld strives to only recommend deals on solid monitors that are experiencing legitimate pricing drops. To this end, we look for models that have reached or fallen below their all-time-low prices.</p>

<h3 id="are-black-friday-monitor-deals-lower-quality">Are Black Friday monitor deals lower quality?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>No, there&rsquo;s no reason why the monitor deals you find during Black Friday should be lower quality&mdash;at least if you focus on the big-name manufacturers like Samsung, Philips, LG, Dell, HP, Lenovo and so on. It&rsquo;s true that some of the discounted monitors may be 2021 models, but there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. Monitor tech moves rather slowly and there won&rsquo;t be major quality differences between 2021 and 2022 models. The important thing is to get a monitor at a legitimately lower price&mdash;and we have done the heavy lifting to curate those legit deals.</p>

<h3 id="what-should-i-look-for-in-a-black-friday-monitor">What should I look for in a Black Friday monitor?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Ah, we&rsquo;ve arrived at the question of the hour.</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s first talk about refresh rate, which is important if you&rsquo;re looking for a gaming monitor. The refresh rate is how fast a monitor can redraw the image on its screen. The faster the refresh rate, the smoother your visuals will look. For competitive first-person shooters, we&rsquo;d recommend 120Hz as the minimum rate. Anything higher is good enough for the eSports realm.</p>



<p>Resolution is another important feature to consider. Much like the refresh rate, the higher the number, the better. We&rsquo;re talking about the quality of images and video here. 1080p is the bare minimum for most&nbsp;monitors. However, if you&rsquo;re a video editor, bumping the resolution up to 4K makes a massive difference, as it allows you to see more detail.</p>



<p>The final thing is the screen size. 27 inches is the most common and a good size for a home office. For gaming monitors, 24 or 27 inches is best. Sometimes a larger screen causes eye strain and if you&rsquo;re going to be staring at one for hours, it&rsquo;s better to go a bit smaller. For 4K monitors, 32-inches is a good option, as it gives you quite a bit of screen to work with.</p>

<p>Amazon&rsquo;s going to have a slew of awesome deals. That&rsquo;s a given. However, for monitors, you should definitely peruse the main pages of HP, Dell and Lenovo. Personally, I find myself going directly to the manufacturers more often than not. You can also widen your net and scope out other online retailers like Best Buy and Newegg.</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>It&rsquo;s Black Friday and if you&rsquo;re a Costco member you can snag one of the best gaming PC deals of the year. On Costco&rsquo;s website you can purchase the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.costco.com/hp-victus-gaming-desktop---amd-ryzen-7-5700g---radeon-rx-6600xt.product.4000056482.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1394265-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">HP Victus gaming desktop for only $700</a>, which is a whopping $300 off the regular price. This is a crazy good deal for an already budget friendly gaming rig capable of solid 1080p gaming performance.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a new gaming desktop on a budget, this HP Victus offers stellar value for your money&mdash;something that&rsquo;s been hard to find the last two years. Loaded with a Ryzen 7 5700G CPU and a Radeon RX 6600XT, you&rsquo;ll be able to easily handle modern games at 1080p resolution with the eye candy cranked, though you&rsquo;ll need to be wary enabling intensive ray tracing effects on any mainstream GPU. It also comes with a potent 32GB of RAM so you can conquer all of those productivity tasks you&rsquo;ve been putting off and a 512GB PCIe M.2 SSD to load all of those maps faster than your opponents. This is the cheapest we have ever seen this combination of CPU and GPU in a desktop PC, and the plentiful RAM and lightning fast SSD just sweeten the deal.</p>



<p>Time is already running out on Black Friday sales, so grab this killer gaming PC deal from Costco while you can.</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Black Friday is here and ready to party. Gamers, if you&rsquo;re looking for a powerful laptop for those late night sessions, you&rsquo;re in luck. We&rsquo;ve got an absolutely stunning deal for you today. Newegg is selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16834233521&amp;xcust=2-2-1394121-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Gigabyte Aero 5 XE4 for $1,1249.99</a>. That&rsquo;s a savings of $949, which is ridiculous in the best way possible and one of the lowest prices we&rsquo;ve ever seen for a notebook with an RTX 3070 Ti inside. This laptop features powerful specs as well as a gorgeous AMOLED display. You really can&rsquo;t go wrong here. Let&rsquo;s get right into it.</p>



<p>The Gigabyte Aero features an Intel Core i7-12700H CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of SSD storage. That&rsquo;s a powerful configuration for gaming or content creation tasks alike. The 15.6-inch AMOLED display is positively stunning with a resolution of 3840&times;2160 and a refresh rate of 60Hz. This screen should provide ultra-sharp details as well as a vibrant picture, which is important for photo or video editors. For ports, you&rsquo;re getting three USB Type-A, one Thunderbolt 4, one mini DisplayPort 1.4, one HDMI, one RJ-45, and one headphone/microphone jack.</p>



<p>This is a delicious deal, but we suspect it won&rsquo;t last very long. Jump on it now before it&rsquo;s gone!</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Sure, Steam Deck may get all the headlines these days, but when you want a no-nonsense, pick-up-and-play portable gaming experience, the vaunted Nintendo Switch still holds the crown&mdash;especially if you want to play Nintendo exclusives like <em>Zelda </em>and <em>Bayonetta</em>. Good news! If you&rsquo;re looking to hop onboard the bandwagon, Nintendo&rsquo;s annual <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Deluxe-Download-Individual-Membership/dp/B0BJWZZ9T1&amp;xcust=2-1-1390712-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Black Friday Switch bundle</a> is back and it&rsquo;s the perfect starting point for experiencing everything the console has to offer.</p>



<p>Nintendo&rsquo;s Black Friday Switch deal isn&rsquo;t technically a discount&mdash;the system costs the same $299 as usual and it&rsquo;s only available with the red and blue Joycon controllers. But you&rsquo;ll get some very nice extras tossed into the pot too: A free copy of <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> and a code for three free months to Nintendo Switch Online, which you&rsquo;ll need to play games online. <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> is <strong>the</strong> game to pick up on the Switch and usually costs $50 to $60 on its own. I&rsquo;ve been playing it weekly for years now, both on the go and hooked up to my TV!</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll find the Black Friday Nintendo Switch deal at the usual retailers:</p>

## The best 1080p graphics card plunges to just $190 for Black Friday

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Just because you&rsquo;re a PC gamer doesn&rsquo;t mean you can afford to buy a desktop made out of pure platinum, water-cooled with the tears of extremely wealthy angels. And if you&rsquo;re trying to build a budget machine, you&rsquo;ve had a really hard time of it lately. That&rsquo;s why you should pounce on this Black Friday deal: an AMD Radeon RX 6600 graphics card for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/msi-radeon-rx-6600-mech-2x-8g/p/N82E16814137690?&amp;xcust=2-2-1388036-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">more than a hundred bucks off the MSRP</a>. </p>



<p>The card is the MSI Mech Radeon RX 6600, packing 8GB of GDDR6 RAM and a compact, dual-fan cooler design. The vendor is Newegg, which discounted the standard price of $280 down to $210. You can get an extra $20 off with a rebate card, bringing the final price down to $189.99 &mdash; that&rsquo;s $140 off the $330 retail price of the RX 6600 that AMD set at its launch a little over a year ago. </p>



<p>But wait, there&rsquo;s more! On top of the discounted card, AMD is throwing in its latest &ldquo;Raise the Game&rdquo; bundle, which includes online codes for zombie shooter <em>Dead Island 2 </em>and sci-fi horror title <em>The Callisto Protocol</em>. That&rsquo;s a $120 value, though it&rsquo;s admittedly a much more subjective one (y&rsquo;all couldn&rsquo;t throw a non-horror game in that bundle?). </p>



<p>The Radeon RX 6600 isn&rsquo;t going to win any polygon-pushing contests with the biggest and most expensive cards on the market, but it&rsquo;s a fantastic affordable option for anyone who&rsquo;s targeting 1080p visuals. PCWorld executive editor Brad Chacos called it &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/543823/amd-radeon-rx-6600-review-finally-a-true-1080p-graphics-card.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">fast and power efficient</a>,&rdquo; but lamented its relatively high price. Thankfully, that problem has been solved, and it&rsquo;s evolved into the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">best 1080p graphics card option</a> in today&rsquo;s complex market. </p>

## How to check your laptop’s battery health

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Battery life is an often vague and nebulous concept. In theory, it can be represented by a single number but, in practice, literally hundreds of factors can shorten or lengthen endurance. That&rsquo;s frustrating if you&rsquo;re trying to gauge the battery life and health of your notebook, especially if you&rsquo;re trying to determine if it&rsquo;s time to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2854456/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">buy a new laptop</a>.</p>



<p>Windows has a secret feature called Battery Report that can help. It&rsquo;s what we use while testing notebook endurance at PCWorld&mdash;and it&rsquo;s how you can tell if <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1377160/your-laptops-battery-life-may-be-dropping-faster-than-you-think.html">your laptop&rsquo;s battery life is dropping faster than you think</a>. Here&rsquo;s how to access Battery Report and understand what it reveals you about your laptop.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-create-a-battery-report">How to create a Battery Report</h2>



<p>Battery Report is not a new feature, but it remains under-the-radar because there&rsquo;s no way to access it through Windows&rsquo; settings menus. You can only create a Battery Report through the Command Prompt. Here&rsquo;s how to do it:</p>



<ul><li>Perform a Windows Search for <strong>CMD </strong>or <strong>Command Prompt</strong>. You&rsquo;ll see Command Prompt appear and the search results. Open it. Alternatively, you can find Command Prompt listed under Windows System in the Windows Start menu.</li><li>Once open, you&rsquo;ll see a command line starting with C: and ending with the name of your user account. A blinking cursor will appear at the end of this command line. Type <strong>powercfg /batteryreport</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong> on your keyboard.</li><li>If successful, the Command Prompt will tell you a battery life report was saved to your user folder.</li><li>Navigate to the folder listed in the Command Prompt. This will be your default user folder, which is C:Users&lt;yourusername&gt;</li></ul><div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/07/command-prompt-100896507-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="command prompt" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/07/command-prompt-100896507-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption><p>The Windows Command Prompt.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>You can access the Battery Report either by using File Explorer to navigate to your user folder, or by performing a Windows Search for <strong>battery report</strong>. Note that it may take several minutes for Windows Search to index the new report and allow you to search for it, so File Explorer might be faster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Battery Report is saved as an HTML document, so you can open it with the web browser of your choice. Once open you&rsquo;ll find a long document that is packed with information. Here&rsquo;s how to decipher what each section means.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-use-battery-report-to-estimate-battery-life">How to use Battery Report to estimate battery life</h2>



<p>The Battery Report can be used to gauge battery life in a few ways, but most people will want to scroll to the bottom of the report where you&rsquo;ll find the <strong>Battery life estimates </strong>section.<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>



<p>This does the math calculating how long the battery could last based on how long you&rsquo;ve used it each day or week. The estimate is handy because you don&rsquo;t have to fully drain the battery.</p>



<p>Take a look at the Active column under At Full Charge. This will show a result formatted in hours, minutes, and seconds. If the column says 4:56:22, for instance, that means the battery was estimated to last four hours, 56 minutes, and 22 seconds.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/07/battery-life-estimates-100896510-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="battery life estimates" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/07/battery-life-estimates-100896510-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a></figure></div>




<p>You will also notice the log lists At Full Charge and At Design Capacity. The At Full Charge column is the estimate you want to pay attention to, as it creates an estimate based on the maximum charge your laptop&rsquo;s battery can handle right now.</p>



<p>The At Design Capacity column creates an estimate based on the maximum battery charge of your laptop when it was new. This is a useful comparison for an older laptop.</p>



<p>The log is not perfect. The estimate is based on how you used the battery in the past so it will be off if you change how you use the PC in the future. Even a minor change, like switching the web browser you use, can throw off the estimate.</p>



<p>Battery report&rsquo;s math can also prove a bit&hellip;odd, at times. You will see errors when a system is used for only a short period of time or in short bursts throughout the day. You may also notice errors if the system is not used at all for several weeks.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-use-battery-report-to-measure-battery-life">How to use Battery Report to measure battery life</h2>



<p>The battery life estimate is useful for a quick glance, but you&rsquo;ll need to go deeper if you want an accurate result.</p>



<p>Take a look at the Battery usage section of the report. This shows you how the battery was actually used in the last three days. You can try to piece together battery life using these snippets, but it&rsquo;s tough.</p>



<p>You can only record an accurate result by forcing your laptop to discharge its entire battery in one go. It&rsquo;s possible to do this while using the laptop normally, but it&rsquo;s easier to use a video, script, or benchmark that can run unattended. Here&rsquo;s a few suggestions:</p>



<ul><li>A YouTube video that&rsquo;s 10 hours long, or longer.</li><li>Use the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://web.basemark.com&amp;xcust=2-1-394918-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Basemark Web 3.0 benchmark</a>. Check the benchmark&rsquo;s configuration options and turn on Battery Life mode, which infinitely loops the benchmark.</li><li>Use <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imacros-for-chrome/cplklnmnlbnpmjogncfgfijoopmnlemp?hl=en&amp;xcust=2-1-394918-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">iMacros</a> to create a custom web browsing macro and then use the loop feature to run the macro until the battery is drained.</li><li>Use a program like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.macrorecorder.com&amp;xcust=2-1-394918-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Macro Recorder </a>to create a loop that repeats infinitely.</li></ul><p>Also turn off all sleep and hibernation features, including those that turn off or dim the display.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/07/battery-usage-100896508-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="battery usage" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/07/battery-usage-100896508-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a></figure></div>




<p>Start your chosen test and wait until the laptop reaches its critical battery state. It will automatically power off. Connect the laptop to power, turn it on, and run the battery report again. The Battery usage section of the report will tell you how long the battery endured.</p>



<p>Running this test will give you an accurate endurance baseline. You can compare it to similar tests from other people who own the same system, or you can run the test every month to see how battery life holds up over time.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-use-battery-report-to-measure-battery-health">How to use Battery Report to measure battery health</h2>



<p>Battery Report offers two more ways to decide if your battery is over the hill.</p>



<p>The first is Cycle Count, which you&rsquo;ll find near the top of the report under <strong>Installed Batteries</strong>. Cycle count is an estimate of how many times your laptop&rsquo;s full battery capacity has been discharged.</p>



<p>This is cumulative: one cycle can mean the battery was discharged by 20 percent five times, or 100 percent once. A typical laptop battery should handle several hundred charge cycles before there&rsquo;s any meaningful change in battery capacity. Most can handle 500 to 1,000 cycles before battery capacity becomes a problem.</p>



<p>You can also examine the <strong>Battery capacity history</strong> section found halfway through the report. This provides a log of measured battery capacity and also, for convenience, shows the battery&rsquo;s design capacity, which is how much power the battery should hold if it performed as intended.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/07/battery-capacity-history-100896509-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="battery capacity history" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/07/battery-capacity-history-100896509-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a></figure></div>




<p>Many new laptops will show a full charge capacity that&rsquo;s a bit higher than the design capacity, but the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1377160/your-laptops-battery-life-may-be-dropping-faster-than-you-think.html">full charge capacity will decrease as the battery ages</a>. The laptop above, for instance, is approaching its tenth birthday.</p>



<p>A full charge capacity that&rsquo;s 20 percent lower than the original design capacity, or lower, indicates an older battery. There&rsquo;s nothing to stop you from running a battery into the ground, though. A modern laptop battery will stop working entirely long before its full charge capacity reaches zero.</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>First, the good news: Most modern PC monitors are rather decent. Their minimum brightness, contrast, and color accuracy have improved significantly over the past decade. It&rsquo;s a great time to upgrade even if you stick to budget monitors.</p>



<p>If you want a quick, easy recommendation: Go for a 24-inch monitor with 1080p resolution or a 27-inch monitor with 1440p resolution. An IPS panel is preferable, though VA is also good. Gamers can spend a little more to snag either option with a 144Hz refresh rate, which offers a smoother and more responsive experience.

<p>The technology behind monitors is complex but well understood. There&rsquo;s just a handful of major &ldquo;monitor types&rdquo; available, each defined by the LCD panel technology used. Nearly all monitors available today fall into these groups.</p>



<p>Monitor manufacturers will list panel type in a monitor&rsquo;s specifications, but you may have to dig a bit to find it. Take the extra time to find out. Panel type can tell you a lot about a monitor.</p>



<h3 id="in-plane-switching-ips">In-Plane Switching (IPS)</h3>



<p>IPS rules the world of computer monitors. A typical IPS monitor is bright and crisp, with good sharpness and great viewing angles. Color performance ranges from acceptable to truly spectacular. Modern IPS monitors can support fast pixel response times and high refresh rates, which is good news for gamers.</p>



<p>IPS monitors have disappointing contrast and black levels, however, which can make them appear hazy when viewing dark images. This is most noticeable in a dark room.</p>



<h3 id="vertical-alignment-va">Vertical Alignment (VA)</h3>



<p>Increasingly popular, VA monitors are as bright and colorful as their IPS counterparts and have a better contrast ratio and darker black levels, which improves overall image quality. VA monitors designed for gaming can offer excellent motion clarity, and Samsung&rsquo;s best VA panel monitors are particularly crisp.</p>



<p>Viewing angles are more limited, however, so the VA monitor image quality can degrade if not viewed straight-on. IPS monitors also have better motion clarity at most price points.</p>

<h3 id="twisted-nematic-tn-technology">Twisted Nematic (TN) technology</h3>



<p>TN panels are known for being inexpensive to make. They also have very quick pixel response times, which improves motion clarity.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, TN has limitations in contrast and color performance that make it unattractive, so I can only recommend TN to extremely hardcore gamers. BenQ&rsquo;s Zowie line is a good choice for those on the &ldquo;path to pro.&rdquo;</p>



<h3 id="organic-light-emitting-diode-oled">Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED)</h3>



<p>OLED isn&rsquo;t based on LCD technology at all. It instead uses organic pixel elements that emit their own light (a trait often referred to as &ldquo;self emissive&rdquo;). OLED is the king of contrast and black levels, since an OLED pixel that&rsquo;s turned off emits no light at all. OLED generally beats other panel types in color performance and also has best-in-class motion clarity. Viewing angles are great, too.</p>



<p>OLED panels aren&rsquo;t as bright as the competition at the top end, and OLED can suffer permanent image retention over time (though this takes many thousands of hours). The technology is also very expensive in PC monitors.</p>



<h3 id="sowhats-the-best-monitor-type">So&hellip;what&rsquo;s the best monitor type?</h3>



<p>OLED wins out on image quality, but high pricing and limited availability mean I can&rsquo;t recommend it for everyone. It&rsquo;s too expensive and too hard to find.</p>



<p>That leaves IPS with the crown for most people, though a VA panel monitor could be a better choice if you don&rsquo;t view from an angle and want improved image quality in movies and TV shows.</p>



<h3 id="a-note-about-mini-led">A note about Mini-LED</h3>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 mini-LED monitor" class="wp-image-560234" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/samsung-odyssey-neo-g9.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p>A handful of monitors are now available with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/560224/oled-vs-mini-led-the-pc-displays-of-the-future-compared.html">Mini-LED technology</a>. This is a backlight technology, not a panel technology, but still important.</p>



<p>Mini-LED uses an array of independent LED lighting zones behind the display panel to precisely control the backlight. In my testing, a Mini-LED monitor can offer a 300 to 600 percent improvement in contrast when compared to similar monitors that lack Mini-LED. It&rsquo;s extremely noticeable.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll find Mini-LED available with both IPS and VA monitor types. The traits of each panel type still otherwise apply. OLED is not used with Mini-LED because the panel creates its own light, making a backlight unnecessary.</p>



<p>Mini-LED has a few flaws. The backlight zones can cause bright halos to appear around objects, an issue known as blooming. It&rsquo;s most noticeable in a dark room. It&rsquo;s also expensive to make, so you&rsquo;ll only find Mini-LED in premium monitors.</p>



<p>The number of Mini-LED lighting zones matters. A basic Mini-LED monitor like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/797584/sonys-stylish-ps5-monitors-and-headsets-play-nice-with-gaming-pcs.html">the Sony InZone</a> offers 96, while the extravagant and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394490/ive-fallen-in-love-with-this-asus-miniled-4k-panel.html">awesome Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX </a>has 1,152. More zones means better overall contrast and less blooming.</p>

<p>Most monitors consist of a 24-inch, 27-inch, or 32-inch widescreen panel. It&rsquo;s easy to assume bigger is better, but it&rsquo;s also important how a display fits within a person&rsquo;s field of view. This means all parts of the display are visible without eye strain or head movement.</p>



<p>Still, monitor size is very much a matter of personal preference. I tend to like smaller displays that don&rsquo;t take up too much desk space and can be used easily in a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/448298/how-to-set-up-two-monitors.html">multi-monitor setup</a>. Others may like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/395110/ultrawide-vs-dual-monitors.html">one big display</a> that takes up the entire desk.</p>



<h2 id="monitor-resolution-1080p-is-common-but-4k-is-obtainable">Monitor resolution: 1080p is common, but 4K is obtainable</h2>



<p>Most budget monitors have a native resolution of 1080p (1920&times;1080). This is okay for 24-inch monitors, but the lack of sharpness becomes obvious on larger displays.</p>



<p>27-inch and 32-inch models are better at 1440p (2560&times;1440) resolution. Most people will notice the increase in sharpness even when browsing the web. It&rsquo;s a great resolution for gaming as well, though PlayStation fans be warned: the PS4 and PS5 don&rsquo;t support this resolution.</p>



<p>4K (3840&times;2160) is ideal for larger monitors. It&rsquo;s also a great upgrade for 27-inch and 32-inch monitors. The added sharpness isn&rsquo;t a must-have, but it&rsquo;s noticeable, especially if you like to use a small font size on your monitor. Games and 4K movies will look razor-sharp.</p>



<p>Pricing is a consideration. Lower resolutions mean lower pricing, which is why 1080p remains so popular. The gap has narrowed in recent years, however, with 4K monitors now starting just below $300.</p>

<p>Ultrawide monitors, which have a 21:9 aspect ratio, are widely available. A 34-inch ultrawide is about as tall as a 27-inch widescreen but seven inches wider. This works out to a 25 percent larger display overall.</p>



<p>This is excellent for people who want more display space but don&rsquo;t want the hassle of a multi-monitor setup. Ultrawides are awesome for games and movies, too, providing an immersive experience. You&rsquo;ll pay more for an ultrawide, with quality models starting around $400.</p>

<p>A monitor&rsquo;s refresh rate is the number of times it can update the display&rsquo;s image each second. Most monitors have a 60Hz refresh rate, but some have a 144Hz, 240Hz, or 360Hz refresh rate, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/704823/the-new-asus-500hz-gaming-monitor-is-the-worlds-fastest.html">with 500Hz models on the way</a>.</p>



<p>Higher refresh rates look smoother when images are in motion. It also lowers input lag because a new image appears on the display more frequently. The benefits improve as refresh rates go up, though the differences may become more difficult to notice.</p>



<p>Those who don&rsquo;t care about gaming can safely stick to 60Hz, while most gamers will appreciate the upgrade to 144Hz. Refresh rates beyond that are smoother but an optional luxury rather than a must-have.</p>



<h3><strong>A</strong>daptive sync: Common and useful</h3>



<p>Adaptive Sync can synchronize a PC&rsquo;s video output with the refresh rate of a display. This offers perfect frame pacing with no hitches, hesitations, or screen tearing (so long as the PC&rsquo;s hardware is up to the task at hand, at least). Adaptive Sync is a must-have feature for PC gamers, but it&rsquo;s common even on budget monitors meant for productivity and office work.</p>



<p>AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync are common standards. They&rsquo;re designed to work with each company&rsquo;s respective video cards, so it&rsquo;s important to pay attention to which standards a monitor supports. There&rsquo;s also a third-party standard called VESA AdaptiveSync. AMD, Intel, and Nvidia all support VESA AdaptiveSync in their latest graphics solutions, though functionality may be more limited than using the company&rsquo;s in-house standard.</p>



<p>Though mostly for gaming, Adaptive Sync is common and has no real price premium attached to it. It&rsquo;s an easy feature to recommend.</p>



<h2 id="monitor-ergonomics-adjustable-stands-rule">Monitor ergonomics: Adjustable stands rule</h2>



<p>Monitors ship with a variety of stands ranging from fixed plastic bases with no adjustment to complex monitor arms that can hold a monitor at almost any angle and orientation.</p>



<p>I recommend a stand that at least adjusts for height and tilt. This will let you find a comfortable viewing angle. If the monitor is a second display, look for swivel (which adjusts the angle horizontally) and pivot (which can rotate the monitor 90 degrees).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look for monitors that have a 100x100mm VESA mount. This will let you add a third-party monitor stand or arm later. Most monitors sold today have this&mdash;but some budget models don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Many monitors advertise support for High Dynamic Range (HDR) content. HDR can support a wider range of luminance and color than what&rsquo;s now called SDR. Generally speaking, HDR content on a great HDR display can look far more vivid and lifelike.</p>



<p>The key is a &ldquo;great HDR display,&rdquo; and&hellip;most monitors aren&rsquo;t that. HDR support merely means a monitor can accept and display an HDR signal. It promises nothing about the quality of the experience which, in most cases, is not good.</p>



<p>If you do want great HDR, look for a monitor with OLED or Mini-LED technology. These can deliver the range of contrast and color performance needed to make HDR truly stand out. Both are expensive, putting quality HDR out of reach for most people.</p>



<p>Already have an HDR monitor, or plan to buy one? <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394712/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hdr-on-your-pc.html">Our guide to HDR on Windows will help you get started</a>.</p>

<p>Most monitors don&rsquo;t offer many added features that stand out from competitors. Some have speakers. Many don&rsquo;t. A few models offer a remote control. Still, most monitors are similar.</p>



<p>USB-C is the one key exception. A monitor with USB-C can charge a connected device, such as a laptop, or be used to extend connectivity like a USB-C hub.<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/612470/you-should-buy-a-usb-c-hub-monitor-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html"> I&rsquo;ve detailed the many perks of USB-C in another guide</a>.</p>



<h2 id="monitor-shopping-tips-pricing-matters">Monitor shopping tips: Pricing matters</h2>



<p>A monitor&rsquo;s price is by far the most important single factor when shopping for a monitor.</p>



<p>Perhaps this seems obvious, but it&rsquo;s more true of monitors than most consumer tech. Monitor pricing sees huge swings based on availability and sales events.</p>



<p>LG&rsquo;s 27GL850-B is a great example. The Amazon.com price of this monitor swung between a high of $496.99 and a low of $299.99 in just three months between April 1, 2022 and June 30, 2022.</p>



<p>This pattern plays out across the entire monitor market, so it&rsquo;s important to compare sales before buying. Shopping at one retailer could mean overpaying by hundreds.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to keep this monitor buying guide direct and to the point, but I&rsquo;ll admit it can still be a lot to take in. Here&rsquo;s a summary of what most people should look for.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Monitor type</strong>: IPS is the market leader, though VA is also good. OLED is spectacular but expensive. Avoid TN.</li><li><strong>Monitor size</strong>: A 27-inch monitor is the go-to choice. Go bigger if you prefer.</li><li><strong>Monitor resolution</strong>: 1440p is recommended, 4K is a nice upgrade.</li><li><strong>Monitor refresh rate</strong>: 60Hz is fine for productivity, but 144Hz is awesome in games.</li><li><strong>Monitor adaptive sync</strong>: It&rsquo;s a must-have for gamers.</li><li><strong>Monitor stand</strong>: Look for height and tilt adjustment, plus VESA mount support.</li><li><strong>Monitor HDR: </strong>Only essential in Mini-LED and OLED monitors.</li><li><strong>Monitor features</strong>: Look for USB-C if you want to use the monitor as a USB-C hub.</li></ul><p>Ready to go even deeper?

<h3 id="are-black-friday-monitor-deals-really-worth-it">Are Black Friday monitor deals really worth it?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes, absolutely, you can find some great deals on monitors during the week of Black Friday&mdash;as evidenced by the great deals in the article above. Mind you, in some tech categories&mdash;like say, wireless earbuds or phone chargers&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see discounts on off-brand gear we&rsquo;d never recommend. But when it comes to monitors, highly reputable brands like HP, Dell, Samsung and Lenovo will drop prices on great models. PCWorld strives to only recommend deals on solid monitors that are experiencing legitimate pricing drops. To this end, we look for models that have reached or fallen below their all-time-low prices.</p>

<h3 id="are-black-friday-monitor-deals-lower-quality">Are Black Friday monitor deals lower quality?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>No, there&rsquo;s no reason why the monitor deals you find during Black Friday should be lower quality&mdash;at least if you focus on the big-name manufacturers like Samsung, Philips, LG, Dell, HP, Lenovo and so on. It&rsquo;s true that some of the discounted monitors may be 2021 models, but there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. Monitor tech moves rather slowly and there won&rsquo;t be major quality differences between 2021 and 2022 models. The important thing is to get a monitor at a legitimately lower price&mdash;and we have done the heavy lifting to curate those legit deals.</p>

<h3 id="what-should-i-look-for-in-a-black-friday-monitor">What should I look for in a Black Friday monitor?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Ah, we&rsquo;ve arrived at the question of the hour.</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s first talk about refresh rate, which is important if you&rsquo;re looking for a gaming monitor. The refresh rate is how fast a monitor can redraw the image on its screen. The faster the refresh rate, the smoother your visuals will look. For competitive first-person shooters, we&rsquo;d recommend 120Hz as the minimum rate. Anything higher is good enough for the eSports realm.</p>



<p>Resolution is another important feature to consider. Much like the refresh rate, the higher the number, the better. We&rsquo;re talking about the quality of images and video here. 1080p is the bare minimum for most&nbsp;monitors. However, if you&rsquo;re a video editor, bumping the resolution up to 4K makes a massive difference, as it allows you to see more detail.</p>



<p>The final thing is the screen size. 27 inches is the most common and a good size for a home office. For gaming monitors, 24 or 27 inches is best. Sometimes a larger screen causes eye strain and if you&rsquo;re going to be staring at one for hours, it&rsquo;s better to go a bit smaller. For 4K monitors, 32-inches is a good option, as it gives you quite a bit of screen to work with.</p>

<p>Amazon&rsquo;s going to have a slew of awesome deals. That&rsquo;s a given. However, for monitors, you should definitely peruse the main pages of HP, Dell and Lenovo. Personally, I find myself going directly to the manufacturers more often than not. You can also widen your net and scope out other online retailers like Best Buy and Newegg.</p>

The Versa 4 is also a good alternative if you want a slimmer, lighter watch that&rsquo;s more focused on fitness.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Some of Best Buy&rsquo;s deals are quite good! The tricky part is knowing which are the best deals and which aren&rsquo;t, since major retailers generally put a bunch of stuff on sale. Not all items are solid products, and not all discounts are solid price drops. That&rsquo;s where we come in&mdash;we sift through the sales to find good gear at truly great prices.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>It depends on the product category, but usually the practice of creating special models for specific periods is limited to TVs. For most everything else, the items are the same as you&rsquo;d find throughout the rest of the year. But again, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re here for: We&rsquo;ve carefully examined the specs and overall value of the deals listed above, so you can shop with more confidence and less hassle.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Best Buy discounts most product categories during Black Friday. During the rest of the year, Best Buy&rsquo;s sales trend more modest than other retailers&mdash;as one of the few stores that still has physical locations, it can&rsquo;t be as aggressive in slashing prices. But during November, it wades much deeper into the fray. The trick is to know which items are also sold by other vendors: For common items like headphones, Amazon Echo speakers, Fitbits, and other consumer electronics, any good discount should match or even undercut a rival store.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>For people who don&rsquo;t have Amazon Prime subscriptions or can&rsquo;t trust deliveries to arrive safely, Best Buy lets you get in on Black Friday discounts in a convenient way. You can order online and then opt to pick up in store. It can also be easier to make returns, since Best Buy will accept those in store as well, too. But the answer to this question is dependent on where you live and what&rsquo;s easiest for you.</p>

The decision&rsquo;s even easier when you can save a ton of cash. A standout among the deals is the Samsung 870 Evo: Popular for its rock-solid reliability, it&rsquo;s hit an all-time low price across several capacities. But don&rsquo;t count out other brands, especially if you have a niche need. The WD Green drive on sale is a low-power model, making it better suited for laptops.</p>

Stock is extremely low now, with just one or two locations still offering this screaming deal.</p>



<p>A ton of other excellent discounts can be found online as well, including the Samsung 870 Evo and Crucial P3, two of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html">our top SSD recommendations</a>. Whether you need a wallet-friendly budget model or one with blistering speed, you can find something. The SK Hynix models are standouts, with both the blistering fast Gen 4 P41 and still speedy Gen 3 P31 at all-time lows. The P41 is an especially great deal, given that&rsquo;s not only cheaper than the better known Samsung 980 Pro, but is faster in benchmarks, too.</p>



<p>PlayStation 5 console owners should consider pairing a SK Hynix P41 with this <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/quiet-BZ003-Cooler-heatsink-modules/dp/B08YRSZPH8&amp;xcust=2-1-1384710-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">be Quiet! low-profile heatsink</a> for a high-performing SSD that&rsquo;ll work with the PS5&rsquo;s expansion slot. It has faster performance than rival options like the Samsung 980 Pro and Crucial P5 Plus. However, if cost is an issue, the 1TB Crucial P5 Plus deal at Best Buy, which includes a low-profile heatsink, is your cheapest option.</p>

<h3 id="are-black-friday-ssd-deals-worth-it">Are Black Friday SSD deals worth it?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Absolutely yes. You can save a significant amount of money (sometimes hundreds of dollars on a high capacity drive) during the big Black Friday sale period. The trick is to know what&rsquo;s a good deal, and what&rsquo;s not. That&rsquo;s where we come in: We&rsquo;ve scoured reputable online retailers, looking for demonstrably good hardware at legitimately good discounts.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Prices depend on the usual street or retail price of the SSD model&mdash;so type of drive, its capacity, and its speed are all factors. Generally, expect to pay about $70 for a good 1TB SATA or NVMe Gen 3 drive, and $100 for a 1TB NVMe Gen 4 drive. But the easier guideline to just look for discounts of at least 20 percent or more.</p>

<h3 id="are-black-friday-ssds-lower-quality">Are Black Friday SSDs lower quality?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Nope! Unlike other products, SSD vendors don&rsquo;t produce special models for sale periods like Black Friday. These are the same models you&rsquo;d find on a retail shelf or available on a website throughout the rest of the year.</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<h3 id="what-should-i-look-for-in-a-black-friday-ssd-deal">What should I look for in a Black Friday SSD deal?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>The best Black Friday deals drop prices on SSDs from reliable brands. A good discount starts around 15 to 20 percent&mdash;and a great deal will be 30 percent or more. Typically, the bigger bargains are higher-capacity SSDs (2TB or higher).</p>



<p>For the specific brands to watch, stick with known names like Samsung, Crucial, SK Hynix, Western Digital, Kingston, and Sabrent. TeamGroup and PNY are also options. The further afield you go, the more likely you&rsquo;ll end up with underperforming (aka slow) drives.</p>



<p>Pay attention to the model, as well. You can often find multiple drives from a single vendor on sale. The usual sweet spots are discounts on high-performing drives rarely on sale and steep price cuts on budget models. This year we should finally see sizable reductions on high-capacity drives (2TB and up), too.</p>

<h3 id="what-kind-of-ssd-should-i-buy">What kind of SSD should I buy?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>This is the big question. If you&rsquo;re on a budget, and have a laptop or a PC that has space for a 2.5-inch drive, a humble SATA SSD will already feel like a lightning fast upgrade from a spinning-platter (HDD) boot drive. (SATA SSDs also exist in the gumstick M.2 size, but this year&rsquo;s best sales for that form factor are the faster NVMe SSDs.)</p>



<p>For those trying to decide between NVMe Gen 3 and NVMe Gen 4 drives, most people can buy a Gen 3 drive with a light heart. Unless you&rsquo;re doing frequent large file transfers (think many GB at a time), you&rsquo;ll get a notable boost in performance over a SATA drive without spending a ton of extra cash. If you&rsquo;re building a system or buying for the very long haul, though, a Gen 4 drive is a good investment. File sizes will only climb over time for game installs, videos, and photos.</p>

<h3 id="are-black-friday-ipad-deals-really-worth-it">Are Black Friday iPad deals really worth it?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Because the iPad sells well pretty much all year round, it&rsquo;s difficult to find dramatic discounts even on Black Friday. Meanwhile, Amazon Fire and Samsung Galaxy Tab series tablets do plummet in price during Black Friday. That said, if you&rsquo;re in the market for an iPad, the deals we&rsquo;ve highlighted above are definitely worth it. The models that get the deepest discounts are <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394441/apple-m1-ipad-pro-2021-vs-surface-go-2-and-surface-pro-7-the-specs-compared.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the ones that are a year older or more</a> (and there are still plenty of new ones in retailers&rsquo; inventory) as well as the most expensive iPads, with high storage capacities and 5G radios. As the version with the newest redesign, the colorful 10th-gen iPad with its new USB-C port will be the hardest to find on sale.</p>

<h3 id="what-size-ipad-should-i-buy">What size iPad should I buy?&nbsp;</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>The iPad Mini is a wonderfully portable little tablet, but at 8.2 inches, it&rsquo;s not much bigger than the biggest smartphones. The largest iPad Pro is huge&mdash;big enough to replace a laptop if you add a keyboard, but that also makes it a lot less portable. The 10- to-11-inch range seems to be the sweet spot for most users. If you&rsquo;re unsure of the size to purchase, head to your nearest electronics store. It almost certainly has most of the models on display.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Is your iPad broken, or does it feel slow and sluggish? Then yeah, it&rsquo;s probably time to buy a new one. If not, feel free to wait a year or two&mdash;or longer. Apple&rsquo;s software support for its tablets is second to none, and you&rsquo;re probably not going to miss out on anything huge with an older model so long as it&rsquo;s still working fine.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="do-i-need-an-ipad-pro">Do I need an iPad Pro?&nbsp;</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>For most people, the answer is &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The iPad Pro is a lot more expensive than the Air or the standard iPad because it uses a much more powerful processor, and includes extra features like Face ID and Thunderbolt connections. It also has access to more powerful multitasking. But all of this isn&rsquo;t really helpful if you mostly use an iPad as a reading or video consumption device. Unless you&rsquo;re trying to replace a full laptop with an iPad, keep that extra money for a nice case or bag.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>That really depends on what you do with it. If you&rsquo;re mostly surfing the web, answering emails, and watching streaming video, then the basic 64GB to 128GB of storage should be more than enough for you. But if you&rsquo;re constantly downloading high-end games or saving HD video to your tablet, you&rsquo;ll want some more.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Do you want to take your tablet on trips and leave your phone at home? Then, yes, you could probably use the cellular upgrade (LTE on the 9th-gen iPad, 5G on everything else). If not, then no, you don&rsquo;t need it. Instead, you can use tethering on your smartphone or local Wi-Fi pretty much all of the time. Also, be aware that cellular iPads need a separate data plan (and a monthly charge) in order to work off of Wi-Fi.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/667842/apple-pencil-2018-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Apple Pencil</a> is a worthy upgrade for anyone who wants to do some drawing or other artwork on an iPad. There are cheaper alternatives, but they&rsquo;re not nearly as good. And even if you&rsquo;re not an artist, there&rsquo;s a certain pleasure in using the iPad like a pencil and paper. (Especially if you&rsquo;re signing digital paperwork frequently.) Keyboards are more situational, and really only useful in the same situation as a full laptop. If you think you need one, you absolutely don&rsquo;t need Apple&rsquo;s expensive accessories &mdash; save some money on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.keychron.com/collections/all-products/products/keychron-k7-ultra-slim-wireless-mechanical-keyboard&amp;xcust=2-1-1382507-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a wireless board from Keychron</a> or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0096M8VR2&amp;xcust=2-1-1382507-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Anker</a> instead.</p>

<p>Sometimes all you need is a barebones machine for web surfing and checking e-mail. Personally, for writing and editing I use a low-powered Chromebook (like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1383937/black-friday-chromebook-deals.html">Chromebook deals here</a>!) and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier. I dig the simplicity of it. But if you&rsquo;re looking for a straightforward Windows laptop for productivity of personal use, check out these deals.</p>

<h3 id="are-black-friday-laptop-deals-lower-quality">Are Black Friday laptop deals lower quality?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>No, there&rsquo;s nothing about the laptops themselves that should suggest you&rsquo;re buying a poorer quality machine. In fact, we&rsquo;ve seen some really high-end laptops go on sale this year. That said, when it comes to more &ldquo;commodity&rdquo; tech gear&mdash;lets say wireless earbuds&mdash;you may find so-called &ldquo;deals&rdquo; on low-quality no-name brands rather than the earbud models you&rsquo;d really be interested in. But when it comes to laptops, we&rsquo;re only recommending models from the big names, like HP, Lenovo, Dell, etc.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes, Black Friday sales do include some great laptops at legitimate discounts. Of course, some retailers will tag a laptop as a &ldquo;deal,&rdquo; when in fact the selling price is no different than what the machine sold for most of the the year. But at PCWorld, we do our best to look at pricing histories, and highlight the deals that have reached or dropped below all-time-low pricing.</p>

<p>You should definitely scope out Lenovo, HP, Dell, and other laptop manufacturers&rsquo; websites. Online retailers like Amazon, Newegg, and Best Buy will also have solid deals, no doubt, but probably not as wide a variety as you&rsquo;ll find from the manufacturers themselves.</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Black Friday is finally here, and that means big savings on the most expensive PC components, like graphics cards. GPU deals have been difficult to find for a few years (thanks for nothing, crypto), but we&rsquo;re finally starting to see significant discounts now that demand is down. Both AMD and Nvidia are introducing powerful new cards, which means new deals on slightly older cards&mdash;especially the most powerful, expensive models. </p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>It&rsquo;s all relative. As we&rsquo;ve stated above, we&rsquo;re seeing discounts on previous-generation GPUs. Does this make them &ldquo;lower quality&rdquo;? No, they&rsquo;re just not bleeding-edge for 2022. But if you&rsquo;re looking to score a true <em>deal</em>, it may make sense to buy a GeForce RTX 30-series and Radeon RX 6000 series card at a big discount. The cards themselves are fine!</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s kind of a big question. The answer is generally &ldquo;whichever one you want and can afford.&rdquo; But there are a lot of factors that go into which card is actually practical for you, not the least of which is whether your PC can physically hold or power up the GPU you choose. Make sure to read PCWorld&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">rankings of the best graphics cards of 2022</a> to make informed decisions.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="should-i-buy-nvidia-amd-or-intel">Should I buy Nvidia, AMD, or Intel?&nbsp;</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>All modern desktop graphics cards connect via the PCI-Express slot on your desktop computer&rsquo;s motherboard. As long as you have one slot free (and the required number of slots open to plug it into your computer case), it&rsquo;ll work. The difference between Nvidia and AMD is pretty slim at most price points. Unless you&rsquo;re interested in a particular feature of one brand, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393414/nvidia-rtx-retrospective-what-two-years-of-ray-tracing-and-dlss-got-us.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX effects</a> or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394725/amd-radeon-fidelityfx-super-resolution-games-gpus-launch.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AMD&rsquo;s FidelityFX SuperResolution</a>, either will do fine. </p>



<p>Intel&rsquo;s brand new Arc cards are a different proposition. The company is competing aggressively on price, making these cards a bargain, at least for newer games. But <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/search?q=arc+review#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=arc%20review&amp;gsc.page=1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Intel&rsquo;s drivers are still immature</a> compared to AMD and Nvidia, especially if you&rsquo;re playing older titles.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>It&rsquo;s time to break out the tape measure. Almost all modern desktops can fit at least some kind of external graphics card, as long as they have at least one PCIe slot on the motherboard. But before buying a new card, make sure your case can fit it, both in length (measured in millimeters) and in slots (the number of eternal notches at the rear of the case, not physical PCIe connections) it needs.&nbsp;Most mid-range cards use two slots, but <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1072925/custom-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-4080s-graphics-cards-insane.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">more powerful ones can use three or even four</a>.</p>



<p>You also need to make sure that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/539143/how-to-pick-the-best-power-supply-for-gaming.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">your computer&rsquo;s power supply can handle the additional watts</a> drawn by the new GPU, and that it has the correct power connections to supply electricity to it. If not, you can always upgrade your power supply, too.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Generally speaking, the more you spend on a graphics card, the more powerful it will be&mdash;the better the effects and the more frames you can push in AAA games. A $1,000 card isn&rsquo;t necessarily twice as good as a $500 card, but it&rsquo;ll definitely be a lot better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there&rsquo;s such a thing as too much. If your computer is six or seven years old, the &ldquo;bottleneck&rdquo; of performance might be your processor or RAM, so spending four digits on a new card wouldn&rsquo;t be wise.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>It depends. If you&rsquo;re upgrading to a really powerful graphics card, you definitely want to make sure that your power supply can handle it. If you haven&rsquo;t upgraded any of the major components in a while, it might be time for a system overhaul, too. That usually means <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/search?q=am4+upgrade#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=am4%20upgrade&amp;gsc.page=1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a new processor, motherboard, and sometimes RAM</a>, though AMD AM4 motherboards can slot in relatively new CPUs without needing any other new components.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure you want to drop that much on new hardware, you can always upgrade the GPU, do some testing in your favorite games, and see if you have the performance increase you want. If not, you can upgrade the other components as needed.</p>

If that wasn&rsquo;t enough, for the first time since it was released earlier this year, the Apple Watch Ultra is on sale for 8 percent off on Amazon.

<p>For those who are more connected with the Google ecosystem, the brand new Google Pixel Watch is also on sale for the first time at 14% off on BestBuy&rsquo;s website.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Definitely! Black Friday is a great time to score a killer deal on a smartwatch, including fitness-focused watches from Fitbit, Google and Garmin and more full-featured app-focused watches from Apple and Samsung. But it isn&rsquo;t uncommon for some retailers to<em> </em>tag consumer items as Black Friday deals, when in fact the price decreases are really just average sale prices. At PCWorld, we do our best to only highlight deals that meet two criteria: The product itself is something we&rsquo;d happily buy ourselves, and the product&rsquo;s price has reached or gone below it&rsquo;s historical all-time-low price.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>No, there&rsquo;s nothing bad about the smartwatches on sale during Black Friday. However, it might be true that a Black Friday smartwatch on sale could be a bit behind-the-times&mdash;for example a 2020 or 2021 model still available in 2022. But this is all relative, and we only recommend smartwatches with pricing that aligns with the features and overall value of the watch itself.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>When looking to buy a smartwatch there are a few things you should consider. First and foremost, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure that the smartwatch is compatible with your smartphone&rsquo;s OS. Buying an Apple Watch only to figure out that it won&rsquo;t work with your Android phone is a bummer to say the least. </p>



<p>Next you should decide what features you want in your smartwatch. Are you a fitness buff? Then choosing a smartwatch with fitness tracking features such as workout tracking, heart rate monitoring, and GPS are great things to have. FitBit and Garmin are the leaders here.</p>



<p>Or are you looking for a smartwatch with a vast library of apps to use? If so, your best bet is to go with an Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy model, as they currently have the largest app rosters available. One other feature you&rsquo;ll want to take into consideration is personalization options. Things such as swappable watch bands and color options can be important if you want different styles for your smartwatch.</p>

For $900 you&rsquo;ll get a solid budget gaming build complete with a Ryzen 7 and an RTX 3060. This is enough to handle modern games with decent graphics settings including the vaunted ray-tracing. If you can stretch your budget a bit further then the iBuyPower TraceMR is also an excellent budget option with a bit more power behind it.</p>



<p>For something with more premium features, the CyberPower PC Gamer Supreme on sale for 35 percent off on Adorama or the Skytech Blaze 3.0 on sale for 29 percent off on Newegg. Both have similar high-end specs and bargain prices, but it will likely come down to which is more important to you: a better GPU or a better CPU. Regardless, both are great deals.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes, Black Friday is a great time to score a great deal on solid PC. But make no mistake, some retailers <em>do </em>tag some consumer items as Black Friday deals, when in fact the price decreases are really just typical sale prices. At PCWorld, we do our best to only highlight deals that meet two criteria: The product itself is something we&rsquo;d happily buy ourselves, and the product&rsquo;s price has reached or fallen below it&rsquo;s historical all-time-low price.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>No, there&rsquo;s nothing bad about the PCs themselves. It&rsquo;s true that a Black Friday PC&rsquo;s specs may be a bit behind-the-times (like the GPU may be an older model), or perhaps the RAM count or SSD size may be less than max. But this is all relative, and we only recommend PCs with pricing that recognizes the component quality inside the machine.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>You&rsquo;ll see a dizzying array of deals when searching for a desktop computer on Black Friday, but they won&rsquo;t all be good values.  When looking at your new computer&rsquo;s CPU, get at least an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5, both of which will provide plenty of processing power for everyday computing tasks. If you don&rsquo;t intend to do any PC gaming, then feel free to save some money by going with integrated graphics. </p>



<p>However, if you are looking to get your game on, we recommend at least an Nvidia GeForce 3060 or AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT, as these are the least expensive discrete graphics cards that can handle ray tracing well. If you aren&rsquo;t interested in those cutting-edge lighting effects, however, the RTX 3050 and Radeon RX 6600 also provide good 1080p gaming performance at even lower prices.</p>



<p>As for RAM, shoot for a minimum of 16GB for content-creation apps and gaming, but for general-purpose internet browsing and mundane office tasks, 8GB should suffice. Storage size is dependent upon your personal needs, but it&rsquo;s generally a good idea to opt for an SSD over a standard HDD as they are much faster and don&rsquo;t significantly affect the price of a desktop PC. Additionally, if you intend to go for an all-in-one with an integrated display, look for a display with a minimum resolution of 1080p.</p>

<p>Absolutely! Black Friday is the perfect time to score a great deal on a dash cam. But be careful as some retailers <em>do </em>tag some consumer items as Black Friday deals, when in fact the price decreases are really just typical sale prices. You may also find retail pages filled with subpar dash cams from no-name manufacturers. But at PCWorld, we do our best to only highlight dash cam deals that meet two criteria: The product itself is something we&rsquo;d gladly buy ourselves, and the product&rsquo;s price is at or near it&rsquo;s historical all-time-low price.</p>

<p>Not at all. There&rsquo;s nothing bad about the dash cams themselves, but it may be the case that dash cams on sale during Black Friday are previous years&rsquo; models or might not have the latest features and specs.

<p>When purchasing a dash cam, you will want to focus on a few important features such as video capabilities, recording options, and other handy nice-to-haves. Video capabilities will be the most important aspect of your decision. You&rsquo;ll want to consider whether you need front and rearview or just front view. Also, check the resolution&mdash;we recommend at least 1080p, but premium 4K resolution dash cams really make a difference if you can swing the extra cost. </p>



<p>Additionally, you will want to take a look at the field of view. The sweet spot is between 120 to 140 degrees field of view, as anything less might miss important things and anything more may cause a fish-eye distortion to the recordings.</p>



<p>Next, you will want to decide on the recording options you need. Continuous loop recording automatically overwrites older recordings at specified intervals (unless saved) in order to minimize storage requirements. There is also incident recording, which uses motion detection and triggered impact detection to record possible accidents. </p>



<p>As for storage options, you will generally find that there are two options to choose from: cloud storage and microSD card storage. Cloud storage isn&rsquo;t as common, but it can be nice to have if you&rsquo;re worried about losing a physical memory card. Otherwise, a microSD card will be the most common option.</p>



<p>Finally, you should consider any other handy features that a particular dash cam might provide. These include GPS navigation, phone connectivity, parking monitoring, night vision, and speed detection. All of these will depend on your personal preference, but should be taken into account before purchase.</p>

<p>In the United States, insurance companies generally don&rsquo;t offer discounts for customers with dash cams installed. That said, the cameras do have their upsides: If you get into an accident, the video evidence can be used to prove you weren&rsquo;t at fault. To this extent, dash cams can be useful for capturing evidence of car theft, vandalism and of course run-of-the-mill accidents.</p>

The Toshiba C350 at Amazon is at an all-time low, and our budget TV picks are basically a collection of smart 4K TVs at various sizes, with some basic HDR technology to boot. TCL and Hisense offer some solid value here.</p>



<p>OLED TVs are known for their deep, inky blacks, and we really think that the Sony 55-inch Bravia OLED from Best Buy offers what you want: a sizeable TV with a premium display technology at a steep discount. But if you want a smaller model, the LG A2 is way cheaper! LG&rsquo;s C-Series at Newegg is a superb upgrade, and is rated exceptionally highly by numerous publications.</p>



<p>The Samsung TU690T display prioritizes screen size. Sony&rsquo;s 4K Full Array XR65X90K is priced a bit higher, but its full-array local dimming is a compromise between an LED-lit TV and OLED, and will simply look a bit better than the other budget TVs&mdash;it&rsquo;s also at an all-time low price. </p>



<p>We also like the Hisense U7H, as it offers local dimming, a 120Hz refresh rate, and has some newer features that include an absolutely brilliant backlight that can improve HDR viewing. Different retailers (Amazon and Best Buy) offer the best prices, but on different sizes. Hop between retailers to find the best deals.</p>

<h3 id="what-should-i-look-for-in-a-black-friday-tv">What should I look for in a Black Friday TV?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Size matters. Most people probably want to buy a 50-inch TV or larger for their living room or family room. We encourage you to review TechHive&rsquo;s straightforward explanation of <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/600006/tv-tech-terms-demystified-part-one-screen-size-resolution-and-speed.html">what TV sizes matter</a>, TV <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/2999888/tv-tech-terms-demystified-part-two-display-types-and-technologies.html">display types and display technologies</a>, and <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/3051792/tv-tech-terms-demystified-part-four-led-backl">LCD backlighting tech</a>.</p>



<p>The short answer, though, is to buy the biggest TV that you feel comfortable with. Second, focus on backlighting. Most TVs use LEDs, but more advanced TVs use QLED or miniLED, and the <em>very</em> best models use OLED display tech. Most eyes can notice the improvements offered by OLED TVs, notably inky blacks and more vibrant, richer colors. Also look for HDR (High Dynamic Range), a technology that further improves color richness and brightness, giving you more of a movie-like experience. Most TVs now ship with HDR10, but an HDR10+ display (such as HDR400) will deliver a brighter display and better contrast. It&rsquo;s something your eyes will appreciate.</p>



<p>Finally, you&rsquo;ll want to pay attention to smart features that connect your TV to a streaming video interface, either via a Roku interface or Google/Android TV. Each platform allows you quick access to streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, etc. It really depends on your preference, and whether you want to avoid using, say, the additional remote of an Apple TV box. </p>



<p>You do <em>not</em> need the latest technology, and our picks represent what we consider to be the best value, without asking you to pay several hundred dollars for incremental improvements.</p>

We value a 1080p screen, 8GB of RAM, and a fast processor most of all, and the $179 Asus 2-in-1 offers all of those at the best price. (We really don&rsquo;t consider the SSD storage space to be a deciding factor, save for storing games, since Chromebooks are so cloud-focused.) The Asus Chromebook C425 is priced quite attractively, and just the 4GB of RAM is holding it back.</p>



<p>In the midrange category, the Flex 5i will offer a bit more performance than the Flip C433&hellip;but $70 less is hard to pass by. Quite frankly, the &ldquo;budget&rdquo; and &ldquo;midrange&rdquo; categories are beginning to blur. By the way, we generally consider a Core m3 to be more powerful than a Celeron N4020, which is more powerful than the MediaTek MT8183, though not by that much. A laptop-class processor like at Core i3 or a Ryzen 3 will top all of those, easily.</p>



<p>We really don&rsquo;t think that the Asus Chromebook Detachable is that great for the money, though it is a detachable tablet. It&rsquo;s also being offered at the lowest price, by far, in the last six months.</p>

<h3 id="what-should-i-look-for-in-a-black-friday-chromebook">What should I look for in a Black Friday Chromebook?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p id="block-655858d2-a221-44fc-936b-0e71165b3393">We still expect low-end Chromebooks&mdash;say, those with a 768p screen, Intel Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM and 16GB of SSD storage&mdash;to be priced about $100. And if they get much below $100, they become essentially a stocking stuffer for most people.</p>



<p id="block-63e8ba4c-46f5-4356-9687-b1f0fe8ae426">That said, look for these specs in a <em>respectable </em>Chromebook: an Intel Celeron N4000 chip or higher, 8GB of RAM, and a 1080p screen. A Pentium Silver N6000 processor is a step up from that. A Core m3-8100Y should be satisfactory, although the midrange or premium Chromebooks include laptop-class chips like a Core i3 or an AMD Ryzen (<em>not</em> Athlon) processor.</p>



<p id="block-b1c0e16d-beb1-4fc4-a291-a8787aca009b">More memory (that is, 8GB rather 4GB of RAM) will allow for more browser tabs and a smoother browser experience. A 1080p screen will offer a comfortable laptop-like viewing experience. Onboard storage really doesn&rsquo;t matter all that much, though at least 32GB is preferable storing for apps, screenshots, and the like.</p>



<p id="block-b0e95528-e4be-46a2-a464-c119b38776e0">If you&rsquo;re familiar with our lengthy <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402141/chromebooks-versus-windows-laptops-which-should-you-buy.html">laptops versus Chromebooks explainer</a>, you know that one of the potential gotchas is buying a Chromebook whose <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6220366?hl=en&amp;xcust=2-1-1383937-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">support window</a> expires soon.

<p>Generally, yes, Black Friday is a good time to buy a Chromebook. Unlike with other product categories, we generally don&rsquo;t see Chromebook makers sneakily raise prices in the weeks leading up to Black Friday, only to offer &ldquo;discounts&rdquo; during Black Friday proper. What we do see, however, are deals offered on older hardware. To that end, you may see &ldquo;deals&rdquo; that we exclude, simply because we think you&rsquo;ll be unhappy with your purchase.</p>

## Xbox Game Pass Ultimate tip: How to get 3 years of access to hundreds of games for dirt cheap

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Currently gamers can <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/xbox-game-pass-ultimate/cfq7ttc0khs0/0007&amp;xcust=2-1-397667-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">pay just $1</a> to access hundreds of titles across PC and Xbox via Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass&amp;xcust=2-1-397667-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> service&mdash;but don&rsquo;t activate that one-month trial just yet. If you play your cards right, you can use that same dollar to lock in a steep discount on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for <em>up to three years</em>.</p>



<p>(<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update November 2022:</span> This trick still works as of Nov 24, 2022.)</p>



<p>When you activate Microsoft&rsquo;s promotion, it not only begins the trial, but also converts existing Xbox Live Gold and standard Xbox Game Pass subscriptions on your account to Game Pass Ultimate (normally $15 per month) at a 1:1 rate. Any prepaid time up to the maximum of three years gets the upgrade. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Looking to load up on Xbox Live Gold at a discount? Keep an eye out for sales at Newegg. For a while it was dropping the price of a <a class="addLink" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/microsoft-12-months/p/N82E16832011522?item=N82E16832011522&amp;xcust=2-1-397667-1-000000-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">1-year subscription to $50</a><a class="removelink" href="https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"><span class="removelink-tooltip">Remove non-product link</span></a> USD about every two to three weeks&mdash;though the last time was in early June. (You can set a deal alert for &ldquo;xbox live&rdquo; at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://slickdeals.net/&amp;xcust=2-1-397667-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Slickdeals.net</a> for an email or push notification of future deals.) But even the regular price of $60 USD per 12-month code, this hack is smoking.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>So if you have only three months of Xbox Live Gold or Xbox Game Pass (or a combination of the two) on your account, you&rsquo;ll end up with three months for your Game Pass Ultimate subscription, plus the additional one month from the trial tacked on. Equally, 36 months of prepaid time transforms into Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for a full three years.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/06/screen-shot-2019-06-24-at-11.43.45-am-100800094-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Xbox E3 2019 press conference Game Pass Ultimate 3" height="655" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/06/screen-shot-2019-06-24-at-11.43.45-am-100800094-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" width="1200" /></a><figcaption>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate bundles together Microsoft&rsquo;s Netflix-esque Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass for PC subscriptions with its Xbox Live Gold multiplayer service.</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>Pretty sweet, right? Multiplatform gamers obviously gain quite a bit from this deal, as Game Pass Ultimate bundles together Xbox Live Gold, Xbox Game Pass, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3401397/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-games-price.html">Xbox Game Pass for PC</a>. You&rsquo;ll get unlimited access to a full range of titles across platforms, including upcoming&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>,<em> Gears of War</em>,&nbsp;and other Microsoft first-party game releases on PC. </p>



<p>But even gamers who play exclusively on PC benefit: Though Xbox Game Pass for PC only initially cost $5 per month, that price lasted only through the beta period, which <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3574699/xbox-game-pass-for-pc-set-to-double-in-price-next-week.html">ended September 16, 2020</a>.</p>



<p>Loading up an account with three years of Xbox Live Gold ($180) and then converting it to Game Pass Ultimate for an additional $1 essentially locks in that $5-per-month rate for three years, which outlives the beta period pricing by a long shot. (You should be able to do this conversion trick if you participated in the Xbox Game Pass for PC beta.) Afterward, you can still convert Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass memberships to Game Pass Ultimate, but at a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-faq&amp;xcust=2-1-397667-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">pro-rated amount</a>.</p>



<p>Read on for a step-by-step guide of how to secure this deal, which includes tips on how to maximize your savings.</p>

<h2 id="news-alert">!- News alert -!</h2>



<p>Talk is swirling that Microsoft may eliminate Xbox Live Gold, which would kill this deal hack. A report from Brad Sams (of Thurrott.com) claims that the company is seeking to make Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (and its $15-per-month rate) the base-level plan. You can hear the details from Sams himself in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwIODjFiYc0&amp;xcust=2-1-397667-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">this YouTube video</a>, in which he also suggests that the death of Gold could happen when Microsoft&rsquo;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard closes in 2023, if approved by U.S. regulators.</p>



<p>On top of that, current energy prices are driving up costs for Microsoft&rsquo;s cloud computing services, leading the company to hint <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-head-hints-at-price-increases-as-cloud-costs-soar&amp;xcust=2-1-397667-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">that price increases on Xbox consoles and subscriptions (like Game Pass)</a> could come to pass. Our best guess is that no changes would be likely during the brisk holiday sales period, but after the start of 2023 it&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s guess as to what will happen.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-convert-xbox-live-gold-or-xbox-game-pass-to-xbox-game-pass-ultimate">How to convert Xbox Live Gold (or Xbox Game Pass) to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</h2>



<p>The most basic description of what you&rsquo;ll do is this:</p>



<ol><li>Buy Xbox Live Gold</li><li>Activate the $1 Xbox Game Pass Ultimate trial</li><li>Agree to a conversion of your Gold and/or standard Game Pass subscription(s) to Game Pass Ultimate</li></ol><p>However, you can run into a few pitfalls during this process&mdash;especially if you&rsquo;re going for the maximum of three years. The detailed instructions below will help you avoid those mistakes.</p>

</div></figure><h4 id="step-1">Step 1</h4>



<p>Decide how long you want Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. To make the most of the deal, get as close to three years of Xbox Live Gold (or Xbox Live Gold + standard Xbox Game Pass) as possible, which is the maximum amount of time you can prepay.</p>



<p>Add months to an Xbox Live Gold subscription using digital subscription codes purchased from Microsoft or another retailer (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/s?k=xbox+live+gold&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2&amp;xcust=2-1-397667-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=xbox+live+gold&amp;xcust=2-1-397667-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Newegg</a>, <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-live-12-month-gold-membership-digital%2F-%2FA-54256322%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=2-1-397667-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Target</a>, etc.). Increase the time on Xbox Live Gold, <strong>not</strong> standard Xbox Game Pass&mdash;Xbox Live Gold is the cheaper option.</p>

<p>Add time in the largest increments possible&mdash;a 12-month code for Gold works out much cheaper per month than the one-month, three-month, and six-month varieties. When purchasing codes, always remember that Microsoft&rsquo;s servers won&rsquo;t let you redeem a code for a duration that exceeds the 36-month cap. (Example: You&rsquo;re at 34 months, but attempt to redeem a three-month code. The servers will not let you activate it.) Short multi-day trial codes for Xbox Live Gold won&rsquo;t work for this promotion, like those for three days or two weeks.</p>



<p><strong><u>WARNING:</u></strong> If you buy three 1-year subscriptions, <em><strong>do not turn on recurring billing</strong></em> while redeeming the codes. Any extra freebie months you get for doing so will make it impossible to redeem the final code.</p>



<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Don&rsquo;t forget that this Game Pass Ultimate $1 promotion includes one month of service that stacks on top of whatever amount of Xbox Live Gold or Xbox Game Pass subscription time you convert. You won&rsquo;t get the full month if it puts you over the 36 month limit, though.</li></ul><div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage right"><figure class="wp-block-image alignright"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/06/xbpu_expiration-100800114-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="xbox game pass ultimate expiration" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/06/xbpu_expiration-100800114-medium.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a></figure></div>

(You already have 16 months of Xbox Live Gold and 3 months of Xbox Game Pass active on your account.) As a Costco member who also has a surplus of Microsoft Reward points, you buy one 12-month code and then use the points to obtain a single 3-month code. You will then get two bonus months by choosing recurring billing when you redeem each code. The $1 Game Pass Ultimate trial will then tack on the final month needed to hit a total of 27.</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4 id="step-2">Step 2</h4>



<p>Activate your Xbox Live Gold codes. Again, as your final reminder, if you have three 1-year subscription codes for Xbox Live, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>do not</em></span></strong><em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> agree</span> </strong></em>to recurring billing in order to redeem your final code.</p>



<p>If you are using a patchwork of different codes, triple-check your math to be sure you know how many times (if any) you need to agree to recurring billing.</p>



<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>OOPS:</strong></span> Did you have three 1-year XBL Gold codes and accidentally make it impossible to redeem that final code? You can wait a month or two, then redeem code #3 and convert. Or you can wait to activate it after you upgrade to Game Pass Ultimate&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be able to redeem it on a pro-rated basis to extend your Ultimate subscription.</em></p>



<h4 id="step-3">Step 3</h4>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage right"><figure class="wp-block-image alignright"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/06/screen-shot-2019-06-20-at-1.39.33-pm-100800115-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Xbox Game Pass Ultimate upgrade confirmation" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/06/screen-shot-2019-06-20-at-1.39.33-pm-100800115-medium.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption><p>The next screen that follows this one will request billing info to pay for the $1 trial.</p> </figcaption></figure></div>




<p>Activate the<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-game-pass/CFQ7TTC0KHS0/0007&amp;xcust=2-1-397667-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"> $1 Xbox Game Pass Ultimate trial</a>. (You can also do so via the Store on an Xbox console.)</p>



<p>You will have two screens to pass through. The first, shown at right, explains how the conversion works if you already have an active Xbox Live Gold or Xbox Game Pass subscription. (Which you should, if you followed Step 2&rsquo;s instructions.)</p>



<p>The second that follows will ask for billing information, in order to process the $1 charge for the one-month Game Pass Ultimate trial.</p>



<p>You should now see &ldquo;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&rdquo; listed under <em>Services and Subscriptions</em> on your Microsoft account page. By default, your Game Pass Ultimate subscription will be set to recurring billing. We suggest you turn this off, lest you be taken by surprise when your subscription expires (especially if that&rsquo;s three years from now). You can do so by clicking on &ldquo;Manage&rdquo; just to the right of the billing information.</p>



<p>Outside of that, you&rsquo;re set to go. Happy gaming!</p>
