<p>It was a night when England succeeded in doing one thing – dousing the expectations that had built so suddenly after the thrashing of Iran in their opening World Cup tie. The stalemate means they will almost certainly qualify for the last 16 – only a heavy defeat against Wales next Tuesday would derail them – but there was precious little else to quicken the pulse.</p><p>England were flat, moving the ball backwards and sideways too often. They could not get around the blue shirts of the United States, failing to stretch them and it very quickly turned into a slog. Harry Kane had one early sighting and a huge chance late on – a free header from Luke Shaw’s curling free-kick that he thudded wide. But that was the sum total of England’s threat on a night when the US were the better team, impressing with their shape and discipline, and having the opportunities to have nicked it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/25/england-usa-world-cup-group-b-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Iran’s football team have dared to show solidarity with those demanding basic freedoms that we take for granted</p><p>You don’t have to be Welsh, Iranian or especially into football to have found good reasons to watch today’s World Cup clash of the two nations.

<p>Having lost to Saudi Arabia, Argentina and Lionel Messi know victory on Saturday is imperative for World Cup progress</p><p>“There’s no pressure,” Lautaro Martínez said, but no one was buying that. Dozens of cameras pointed his way and the question had been direct. Sure, it started, this team lifted Argentina’s first trophy in 28 years, winning the Copa América at the Maracanã, but go out of the tournament on Saturday night and it would be the worst catastrophe in World Cup history. Had they discussed that, his interrogator wanted to know. “No, no, that’s not been talked about,” the striker replied, and why would they? It’s the kind of thought probably best kept to yourself.</p><p>Which doesn’t make it go away. It’s some statement – the worst catastrophe in their World Cup history – and it may sound absurd, as well as still being avoidable of course, but it may not be so far off. Just framing it like that said something of the fear; what’s at stake. Since they won their first title in 1978, Argentina have been knocked out of the group stage once in 11 World Cups. That was in 2002, when they finished below England and Sweden. Now they have lost to Saudi Arabia, falling a single step away from a joint-record 37th game unbeaten. Mexico, their opponents on Saturday, and Poland do not offer an easy way out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/25/scaloni-promises-argentina-will-play-for-their-lives-in-crucial-mexico-game">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is no more elegant pivot than moaning about the World Cup in Qatar to begging a Gulf state to come and buy your club</p><p>“When I want a peerage,” sniffed Alfred Harmsworth (later Lord Northcliffe), “I shall buy one like an honest man.” So yes: I want to begin with an apology for a ridiculous statement <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/18/will-david-beckham-qatar-role-kill-his-brand-world-cup" title="">in my most recent column</a>, which held that David Beckham’s mega-lucrative Qatar promotional deal meant he has been “wearing the face of a man who knows he is never going to get his knighthood now”. This was obviously wrong. Having been paid a reported £150m for his work shilling for the Qatari regime, David is in fact even better placed to buy a knighthood than he was before, and could easily run to a peerage.</p><p>But could David also be involved in the purchase of something else? Namely, Manchester United football club, which you’ll have noted is back on the market after the adored Glazer family have finally decided to cash out of the club they bought with some debt back in 2005. Can you cash out of something you never put cash into? Amazingly, yes.

<p>She blends techniques from the old masters with imagery from 60s porn magazines – and it’s made her one of 2022’s most celebrated young painters</p><p>Somaya Critchlow knows that we’re supposed to be moving <em>away</em> from making images of naked female bodies. Bodies that are socially and sexually available. But her paintings express the appeal of stripping a figure bare. “People try to position my work as being sex-positive or political or whatever – and it’s not, it’s just investigative,” says the London-based artist, who is warm, open and softly spoken in the way that bright people often are. “I’m not trying to be an activist. But I do enjoy painting and I do enjoy my subject matter. Maybe that’s selfish.”</p><p>It seems to be working. This year, Critchlow’s small and intense portraits of curvy Black women in various stages of undress have featured in major group exhibitions across the UK and a solo show at Maximillian William gallery in London.

## Stormzy: This Is What I Mean review – haunted by heartbreak on his most personal album yet

<p><strong>#Merky/0207 Def Jam</strong><br />The rapper is still capable of lyrical swagger, political insight and hugely entertaining flexes but his third LP is a musically subtle trawl through his romantic regrets</p><p>All the stops have been pulled out to reinforce the idea that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/stormzy">Stormzy</a>’s third album is a very big deal. The advance publicity began back in March, during the much-delayed arena tour in support of its predecessor, Heavy Is the Head. Fans were treated to a lengthy video featuring clips from This Is What I Mean’s recording sessions and encouraged to pre-order it from the merch stand, eight months early. Its release has been heralded by a primetime televised chat with Louis Theroux, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uyPzJo5z-g">an online video</a> in which Stormzy plays its contents to super-producer Rick Rubin, who responds almost entirely in superlatives. As of today, a pop-up venue called This Is What I Mean House is open in London, featuring “live conversations with Stormzy, performances, a merch shop and an ‘immersive listening experience’”. It’s a long way from his breakthrough hit, Shut Up, which was heralded by a video shot by a fan in a south London car park. But that’s 2m albums and 14 singles that have either gone platinum, gold or silver for you.</p><p>You wouldn’t describe the new album as unassuming. It is, after all, a record on which Stormzy compares himself to a cross between “Kanye West and Donny Hathaway”. And its best lyrics come on My Presidents Are Black, on which the self-styled “community provider, multiple diss track survivor” takes aim at music industry racism, has a colourful pop at the government (“tell Michael Gove we got something for your nose”) indulges in a vast amount of hugely entertaining flexing and announces that he won’t be reactivating his beef with fellow rapper Wylie on the grounds that he “can’t war with no broken man” – an act of caring and munificence that sounds remarkably like Stormzy reactivating his beef with Wiley.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/25/stormzy-this-is-what-i-mean-review-haunted-by-heartbreak-on-his-most-personal-album-yet">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Lost Dog has a reputation for taking sideways looks at classic tales and taking them into unlikely spaces, but might an interrogation of the murderous Medea in the bowels of the Royal Opera House prove a step too far?</p><p>Christmas theatre: it’s Nutcrackers and sparkle and jollity and “he’s behind you”, plus betrayal and searing revenge and infanticide … er, hang on? Dance-theatre company Lost Dog’s Christmas offering this year sounds distinctly un-festive. Ruination, by director-choreographer Ben Duke, is a reinterpretation of the myth of Medea, best known from Euripides’ play, a sorceress who helps Jason steal the golden fleece from her father and takes off with him (murdering her own brother en route). But when Jason leaves her for another woman she kills her own two sons in a rage of revenge.<br /><br />At what point, I have to ask, did Duke think this was ideal Christmas fare? “I think it was just a really childish kind of contrariness,” he says, laughing. “Someone says: ‘Do a Christmas show’, and then I go, ‘What’s the least Christmassy thing I can think of?’ And it was Medea. But then I started thinking about it. If that’s the opposite of Christmas, because it’s about the death of children and Christmas is about the birth of a child, it started making sense to me.”<br /><br />There was also the fact that it was Kevin O’Hare, director of the Royal Ballet, who was having the conversation with Duke, looking for something to put on in the Royal Opera House’s Linbury theatre. It’s a space in the bowels of the building: you descend multiple staircases to get there, while the cheery evergreen Nutcracker will playing on the main stage above. “So it felt like a shadow world, a subconscious,” says Duke. A trip to the underworld.</p><p><br />Duke, 47, has had a run of hits over the past seven years, taking well-known, much-retold stories and turning them inside out with meta commentaries that are witty, absurd and often deeply moving and truthful. There was his one-man <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/may/27/paradise-lost-ben-duke-review-dance">Paradise Lost</a>, rich with surreal tangents such as God trying to chat up Lucifer in a nightclub; it drew parallels between God’s creation and Duke’s experience of parenthood (he has two daughters), with neither entirely in control of what they’ve made. Then there was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/19/juliet-and-romeo-review-ben-duke-battersea-arts-centre">Juliet &amp; Romeo</a>, which imagined if the star-cross’d lovers hadn’t died and were now a middle-aged couple in marriage counselling; and, which saw one of the characters interviewing the others for a documentary.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/nov/25/ben-dukes-interview-ruination-royal-opera-house">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Just as the clocks on the big screens at either end of this stadium ticked eight minutes into stoppage time, Wales eventually cracked. For so long it seemed they would somehow avoid losing a match that transpired into the epitome of living dangerously well before Wayne Hennessey was sent off for inadvertently poleaxing Mehdi Taremi on 86 minutes. But then the substitute Roozbeh Cheshmi curled home from the edge of the box and Ramin Rezaeian put the gloss on a victory in the 11th minute of stoppage time, denting Wales’s now slim hopes of progressing to the last 16 in the process.</p><p>Sardar Azmoun, the Iran striker, grabbed Carlos Queiroz’s cheeks with joy at the final whistle, before attempting to piggyback his manager moments later, and Iran soon set off on a victory lap as some of Wales’s players lay floored. When Cheshmi struck, Wales could not exactly say it had not been coming. They had been clinging on – Iran earlier rattled the woodwork twice inside 20 seconds in the second half – and Gareth Bale’s hands were clasped behind his back in the box, frantically trying to prevent the possibility of giving away a penalty as Iran peppered the Wales goal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/25/wales-iran-world-cup-group-b-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I desperately wanted to like Outer Wilds so I wouldn’t disappoint my son. But the profound joy of gaming provides a universal bond, even when you totally suck at it</p><p>About a year ago I tried to bond with my 17-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/dec/07/pirate-game-is-full-of-hornswagglers-sea-of-thieves">over Sea of Thieves</a>. It did not work. Since then, he has harangued me about trying Outer Wilds, which he claims is the most profound gameplaying experience of his life. I have delayed to Hamletesque degrees: what will I do if another of his favourite games doesn’t connect with me? Would that mean I can no longer connect with my son?</p><p>As I discovered <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/oct/28/what-i-learned-from-my-latest-gaming-humiliation">last month</a>, it can sometimes be a struggle playing games in your 50s, and dropping down the difficulty can reduce the stress and help me enjoy myself more. But what if I’m losing the patience and mental forbearance required to really <em>get </em>some games now? Gaming subscription services don’t help with this. We have access to so many titles, it is easy to dismiss them too quickly because of the Netflixication of our brains. Too much choice has gifted us with the discernment of a drunk in a kebab shop. If I’m not in the right frame of mind, it doesn’t matter how good the game is – I’ll stop playing after 10 minutes. And this is why I have delayed playing Outer Wilds.

<p>Keira Knightley narrates the diary of a 12-year-old Ukrainian girl that vividly chronicles the early weeks of the Russian invasion</p><p>“Everyone knows the word ‘war’, but few people understand what it truly means,” notes 12-year-old Yeva Skalietska in You Don’t Know What War Is. Yeva is from Kharkiv, Ukraine, and this is her diary, providing a first-hand account of the early weeks of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/17/night-everything-changed-waiting-for-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-kyiv">Russian invasion</a>. Before the war, Yeva would go bowling with friends, go to school and do her homework. But on the morning of 24 February 2022, she was woken by loud metallic noises echoing through the streets. When she looked out of the window of her flat, she saw a rocket go past and explode “with such force I felt my heart go cold in my chest”.</p><p>She and her grandmother, Iryna, quickly joined the residents of their building in the dusty basement, where they fashioned beds out of blankets and bits of cardboard and listened to the bombs dropping outside. The diary goes on to chronicle Yeva and Iryna’s movements as they flee, first to a friend’s house on the other side of the city and later over the border to Budapest. Eventually, with the help of a news team from Channel 4, the pair make contact with a family in Dublin who offer to take them in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/25/you-dont-know-what-war-is-yeva-skalietska-audiobook-review-ukraine-keira-knightley">Continue reading...</a>

It pits the respective Asian and African champions against each other, each of whom lost their opening matches 0-2. At which point, you might argue, the similarities end. While Senegal looked sprightly and competitive against the Netherlands, particularly early on, and were undone mainly by a lack of cutting edge up front, Qatar turned in a rabbits-trapped-in-headlights non-performance against Ecuador, and were lucky their opponents declared at half-time. All that Aspire academy cash, all those gifted places in other tournaments, including this one as hosts, all that unsavoury geopolitical positioning – and for <em>that</em>?</p><p>“Emotionally, things were very difficult, and dealing with the World Cup is completely different. I hope that the performance will be as competitive against Senegal,” admitted their manager, Felix Sánchez, yesterday, adding: “We prepared ourselves for the possibility of an early exit, but this does not mean the end of the project. I am confident that Qatar will continue their project to maintain a strong team, compete and qualify for the upcoming tournaments.” Ah yes, Projects.

<p>Argentina’s conquerors secured a base an hour south of Doha and 25 miles from their own border more than two years ago </p><p>Half a mile to the south of Saudi Arabia’s training pitch, the silhouettes of two camels move slowly against the late afternoon sun. They are carrying visitors along the crest of a sand dune whose slopes are scarred by the tracks of overland vehicles and SUVs. At the bottom, a gargantuan Chevrolet advertisement offers alternative transport options and a long line of semi-permanent structures hawks tourist trinkets. This is the gateway to a region Qatar hopes will bewitch those who want a break from the football: a near-empty expanse of undulating sand that covers the country’s south-eastern interior and is marketed as an outdoor adventurer’s playground.</p><p>In truth it hardly resembles a honeypot and that is how its temporary residents like it. The Saudi Football Association stole in quickly to secure this base, at the exclusive Sealine Beach resort, two and a half years ago. It is only 25 miles from the border with their country and, an hour’s drive south of Doha, feels cut off from the inner city’s manic energy. They knew from the experience of 2019, when Qatar hosted the Gulf Cup, that the noise and logjams of an urban centre present unwelcome hurdles over the course of a tournament.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/25/saudi-arabia-plot-another-world-cup-shock-argentina-poland">Continue reading...</a>

Electrical stimulations were fed into the cells to represent the placement of the paddle and feedback was pinged when the ball was hit or missed. The scientists then measured the DishBrain’s response, observing that it expended more or less energy depending on the position of the ball.<br /><br />“After a 20-minute session, [the DishBrain was] playing much better than then when they started and much better than chance,” Dr Brett Kagan, Cortical’s chief scientific officer, says. While it wasn’t operating at the level of a human or even a motivated mouse, it did demonstrate a consistent learning path and some form of information processing optimisation. “It was so exciting,” Kagan says gleefully. “We honestly did not expect to see the extent of the results.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/nov/25/history-pong-video-game-atari-nolan-bushnell-al-alcorn">Continue reading...</a>

There is no smoking gun and evidence from ancient crime scenes is – unsurprisingly – patchy. But what investigators have learned suggests a prime suspect: humans.</p><p>Take the case of <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.283.5399.205">Genyornis</a>, one of the world’s heaviest birds, which was more than 2 metres tall and weighed in excess of 200kg. It lived in Australia until, along with many other megafauna, it went extinct 50,000 years ago. In North America, giant beavers weighing the same as a fridge and an armadillo-like creature called a glyptodon, which was the size of a small car, existed until about 12,000 years ago, when they, too, went extinct. In all, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extinctions#quaternary-megafauna-extinctions">more than 178 species</a> of the world’s largest mammals are estimated to have been driven to extinction between 52,000 and 9,000BC.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/25/cop15-humans-v-nature-our-long-and-destructive-journey-to-the-age-of-extinction-aoe">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Stickman)<br /></strong>The Berlin-based band’s new album delivers pulverising heft and proggy nirvana at its most polished </p><p>The borders between prog and metal have always been porous, as Massachusetts-formed (and now Berlin-based) quartet Elder clearly understand. They began their own migration from craggy, red-eyed stoner-rock to proggy nirvana with 2015’s latently sophisticated Lore. Their sixth album, Innate Passage, strikes their most polished and satisfying balance yet between ground-shaking heaviness and lofty ambition.</p><p>The magic of Innate Passage lies in how lightly the group wear their instrumental mastery. There’s precious little showboating or self-indulgence, the wild flourishes always in service of the drama, the moment. The expansive playing of Nick DiSalvo (vocals/guitar) and Mike Risberg (guitar/keys) is anchored by a sensitively virtuosic rhythm section as capable of deft complexity as pulverising heft. And while all five of the album’s tracks are epic in length and aspiration, they also share a taut focus, a restless energy. Something is always happening, be it the serpentine groove and electrifying guitar crescendos of Endless Return, the elegant tidal force of The Purpose or the ever-shifting rhythms, mellotron textures and wild, synth-driven math-rock of Coalescence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/25/elder-innate-passage-review-stickman">Continue reading...</a>

## Esbjörn Svensson: HOME.S. review | John Fordham's jazz album of the month

<p><strong>(ACT)<br /></strong>This recently discovered piano meditation from the modest maestro behind the Esbjörn Svensson Trio will entrance fans and fascinate newcomers</p><p>When Esbjörn Svensson made his UK debut at the 1999 Swedish Jazz Extravaganza festival, the then-34-year-old pianist/composer’s jubilant fusions of Thelonious Monk, Ornette Coleman, Keith Jarrett and his own playful muse showed exactly why his reputation had begun to spread beyond Sweden. Within three years the pianist and his open-minded Esbjörn Svensson Trio were touring the world, finding a new contemporary audience by merging classic jazz, catchy themes, intricate improv, classical music and rock-crescendo drama.</p><p>The story ended tragically nine years later when Svensson died in a scuba diving accident. He left behind a powerful EST back catalogue, augmented by the occasional unearthed live recording. HOME.S. is an uncharacteristic solo-piano meditation the artist made at home shortly before his death, only recently discovered by his widow, Eva. The influence of Jarrett’s solo-piano method is audible, but Svensson’s buoyancy, capriciousness of mood and sweeping melodic resources are all his own. He sometimes opens with dreamily wandering chords or treble-melody fragments, but also includes frisky contrapuntal dances and stately baroque sways. The gorgeous Gamma hints at bluesy soul resolutions that only coalesce at the song’s close. Flying double-time freebop erupts out of gracefully interwoven left-right lines, while quiet harmonies turn to clanging soul-jazz chords pushed by rumbling bass-note boogies in the style of early Abdullah Ibrahim. Longtime Svensson fans will be entranced, and newcomers may catch a fascinated glimpse of why this modest maestro’s early demise was such a loss to contemporary music.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/25/esbjorn-svensson-homes-review">Continue reading...</a>

## Marigold and Rose by Louise Glück review – the babies’ tale

<p>The Nobel prize-winning poet’s first novel is a subversive, sophisticated vision of the first year in the lives of twin girls</p><p>When the American poet Louise Glück was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/08/louise-gluck-wins-the-2020-nobel-prize-in-literature" title="">awarded the Nobel prize for literature</a> in 2020, the Swedish Academy commended her “voice that with austere beauty makes individual existence universal”. They might have added that she makes the individual female experience universal, joining it to the canon of male mythology in ways even her titles make clear. The Seven Ages, from 2001 – a stunning reflection on human destiny – was preceded by both The Triumph of Achilles (1985) and Ararat (1990), for example, and followed by Averno (2005), named after the traditional site of the entrance to hell. While her earlier work explores family psychodrama, these books portray the emotional violence of mid-life. In 13 poetry collections and two volumes of essays, Glück’s emotional intelligence never surrenders to cosy consolation, yet the writing remains exquisitely beautiful.</p><p>None of this has changed in her first published fiction. Marigold and Rose can be devoured in a single sitting, and that’s probably the best way to enter its tonal world, which is strangely hypnotic, in part because the mood never swings to violent intensity, and in part because of the orderly rhythms of Glück’s prose. Ten short chapters tell us – though not in exact chronological order – about the first year in the life of twin girls, the eponymous Marigold and Rose. During this period their grandmother dies, their mother experiments with going back to work, and they are “distracted, like all babies, by feelings of triumph. First crawling, then walking and climbing, then talking.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/25/marigold-and-rose-by-louise-gluck-review-the-babies-tale">Continue reading...</a>

That was popping.’” She laughs. “I kept thinking that it was all really basic, and that I could come up with a better melody.” Rather than beat herself up about it, Kelela let the song be.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/25/why-did-i-feel-rusty-white-supremacy-kelela-on-writers-block-outsiderdom-and-her-long-awaited-second-album">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Keith Hall confessed his wife’s murder to an officer wearing a wire – and was found innocent. This programme will leave you scrutinising his every second on screen to make your mind up about him</p><p>Nobody disputes that Patricia Hall left her house in Pudsey, a nice market town between Leeds and Bradford, on 27 January 1992, never to return. That’s about all we know. Her husband, Keith, told police she had driven off in their car late that night, after a marital disagreement; the police strongly suspected Keith had killed her, but no trace of Pat Hall has ever been found. The case remains open, which means the two-part true-crime documentary The Confession (Prime Video) has a bewildering, frustrating tale to tell.</p><p>Episode one chalks up the circumstantial evidence. At first, the police assume that either a body or a sign that Pat is alive will turn up, with the former, grim explanation seen as more likely – especially when a witness reports having seen an unidentifiable figure hop out of the Halls’ car on the night in question, leap over a fence carrying an unidentifiable object and disappear into woodland. Then, interviews with neighbours and relatives start to paint a dark picture. Neighbours say the row between Keith and Pat was audibly vociferous, but then stopped suddenly, with the sound of the car speeding off following a little later. Pat’s friend claims that, three months earlier, she had rung to say Keith had lost his temper and placed his hands around her neck, before relenting.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/25/the-confession-review-youll-study-every-gesture-in-this-true-crime-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

It feels like the Gabba Test in 2015, when retiring bowler Ryan Harris got a lap of honour on the back of a ute when half of the stadium was closed. By now Langer’s circuit has gone on far too long, leaving a lonely figure waving at empty seats.</p><p>In February his resignation letter said that others wanted a fresh direction and that “I respect that decision”. By May it was clear that - spoiler - he did not respect that decision. He spoke at Western Australia’s Government House about a gruff concreter tearily lamenting his absence, then broadsided Cricket Australia during a speech to the WA Chamber of Commerce. Both before and after resigning his former teammates were his allies, with everyone from Ricky Ponting and Shane Warne down through the ranks using their media jobs in a campaign that shifted from reappointment to disappointment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/25/justin-langers-endless-grudge-threatens-to-cloud-new-cricket-summer">Continue reading...</a>
