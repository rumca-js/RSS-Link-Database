<p>These elections are key not just to what the president can achieve in the next two years but to the future of democracy</p><p>When American voters go to the polls on Tuesday, they will be voting not only in a multitude of specific races, but in what feel like two separate elections. The first is a largely traditional version of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-midterm-elections-2022" title="">midterms</a>: a referendum on the incumbent (helping to explain why Joe Biden has been keeping a relatively <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/31/joe-biden-midterms-campaign-low-profile" title="">low profile</a>, given his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/bidens-still-unpopular-but-out-of-the-danger-zone/2022/10/13/f2369e48-4af2-11ed-8153-96ee97b218d2_story.html" title="">approval ratings</a>) and on the economy. In a cost of living crisis, it may not be surprising that 92% of Republicans see the economy as very important, with predictable issues of crime and immigration following behind.</p><p>But among Democrats, only 65% see the economy as very important – while 80% cite the future of democracy, 79% cite healthcare and 75% abortion. This is the second and very different contest. It is a “struggle for the very soul of America”, as Mr Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/11/03/remarks-by-president-biden-on-standing-up-for-democracy/" title="">warned on Wednesday</a>, and a battle over people’s fundamental rights – to control their own bodies, and to have free and fair elections. The context is the storming of the Capitol on 6 January 2021; the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/03/paul-pelosi-attack-hospital-released" title="">vicious attack on Nancy Pelosi’s husband</a> by a man who told police he had planned to kidnap the House speaker and break her kneecaps if she “lied” to him; and the supreme court’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-abortion-summary-supreme-court" title="">overturning of Roe v Wade</a>.

But Republican candidates who have realised the unpopularity of their extreme views are now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/02/us/politics/republicans-abortion-elections.html" title="">muddying their message</a>, as even some voters who define themselves as “pro-life” balk at total bans.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/06/the-guardian-view-on-the-us-midterms-a-tale-of-two-contests">Continue reading...</a>

I longed for the affection she offered my ankles as I filled her bowl, the endless hours I’d spent alone as a writer with her next to me, curled up in a ball, ready for me to bury my face into her when the frustration of a blank page became too much to bear.</p><p>I missed keeping her alive, which was one of the things I was most proud of in my whole life. I’d have done anything for that cat, often sacrificing my own need for food for hers when I was in my 20s and broke. I have lost people in my life and sadly know grief and its vicious claws very well, but Lilu dying was different. The world had not lost someone, I had. I felt quite isolated. The words “it was just a cat” were what I feared people were saying behind my back when I couldn’t stop talking about it, no matter how hard I tried.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/06/i-learned-so-much-about-life-and-love-from-my-cat-that-when-she-died-i-had-her-freeze-dried">Continue reading...</a>

## Aaron Carter was the millennium’s bubblegum bad-boy – and the victim of a rapacious music industry

<p>As a teen heartthrob, Carter seemed to have it all. But like many poster kids of his generation, success came with a dark side</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/05/aaron-carter-singer-and-brother-of-backstreet-boys-nick-dies-aged-34">Aaron Carter, singer and brother of Backstreet Boys’ Nick, dies aged 34</a></li></ul><p>Aaron Carter was just 34 when he died on Saturday, yet he seemed to have lived more lives than most. The singer, and younger brother of Backstreet Boys member Nick Carter, started performing at seven and released his self-titled debut album in 1997, when he was just nine years old. By 13 he had three bestselling albums under his belt and a slot supporting Britney Spears on tour during the height of her fame. At 14, he was selected to perform alongside the likes of Liza Minnelli, Gladys Knight and Missy Elliott at Michael Jackson’s 30th anniversary celebration at Madison Square Garden. That is an incredible list of achievements by anyone’s standards, but – as seems to be the case with so many who find themselves in the public eye from such a young age – Carter’s adult life became defined by his struggles.</p><p>Born in the small town of Rockwood, east Tennessee, Carter’s bubblegum sound and mini-bad boy image made him the definitive millennium child star. Just innocent enough to be family-friendly but just rebellious enough to become the number-one heartthrob for girls who grew up wearing bedazzled headbands and reading J-14, his dishevelled blond hair and Eminem-via-Dennis the Menace look stood out even in an oversaturated landscape of manufactured pop groups and Mickey Mouse Club graduates. His music videos were lurid and memorable, set in the familiar worlds of movie dates, photobooths, street parties, basketball courts, clubs – typically adult settings that made preteendom look and feel like an unruly, insular universe of its own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/06/aaron-carter-was-the-millenniums-bubblegum-bad-boy-and-the-victim-of-a-rapacious-music-industry">Continue reading...</a>

Career criminal who went on to become the Guardian’s prisons correspondent and a campaigner for penal reform<p>Eric Allison, who has died aged 79, had two careers, both profitable in their own way. For 50 years he was a dedicated criminal; a fraudster, burglar and bank robber. For the last 19 years of his life, he was the Guardian’s prisons correspondent – every bit as devoted to exposing injustice as he had been to screwing the system when a criminal.</p><p>Eric came from a family of “straight-goers” – Alf, his father, was tiny in size and mighty in discipline, his mother Nellie (Ellen) adored him despite his lawless ways, and three brothers who would not have dreamed of committing a crime. But Eric was made of different stuff. He never made excuses – he loved the buzz, the danger, the camaraderie, the wins. He was not so keen on the losses, though he never complained about serving time for a crime he had committed.

<p>The novelist’s memoir evokes the ambition and thrill of writing alongside Gore Vidal, Susan Sontag, James Baldwin and his mentor Elizabeth Hardwick</p><p>Reading Darryl Pinckney’s freewheeling new memoir, <em>Come Back in September</em><em>,</em> is like being at a particularly fabulous literary party. Wander its book-lined rooms, and in time you meet just about everyone who was anyone in New York in the years – wild and unstoppably creative – between 1973 and 1989. Here is Susan Sontag dancing at a West Village joint called the Cock Ring with Fran Lebowitz, and here is Mary McCarthy writing, indelicately in the eyes of some, of her late friend Hannah Arendt’s feet (“I think she only once had a corn”). Here is the critic William Empson with chewing gum in his ears (intended to drown out the noise of students at the college where he was a visiting professor), and here is the poet John Ashbery pulling hard on a Gauloise as he reads from his new collection (Jacques Derrida was in the audience).</p><p>Norman Mailer struts by and so does his arch enemy, Gore Vidal; James Baldwin and Elizabeth Bishop both appear. But the real star of the show – the book’s constant and slightly terrifying presence – is the critic and novelist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/dec/06/guardianobituaries.usa">Elizabeth Hardwick</a>, Pinckney’s friend of more than three decades and the key that first turned the lock on his exciting New York life. Pinckney, an award-winning novelist, playwright and essayist, has long kept a diary – he began it as a closeted teenager – and for the purposes of writing this book, which he did mostly during the Covid-19 lockdown, he has raided it as one would a well-stocked larder. Though Hardwick’s life has been much picked over since her death in 2007, the biographers and other vultures attracted as much by her marriage to the troubled Pulitzer prize-winning poet Robert Lowell as by her own dazzling output, you’ll never find her more vividly described than in the pages of <em>Come Back in September</em>: her clothes (chic), her cooking (bad), her aphorisms (which struck like bolts of lightning).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/06/writer-darryl-pinckney-come-back-in-september-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A bullied woman finds contentment in her marriage to a peasant in a quietly affecting portrait of rural life in China</p><p>It’s an arranged marriage of convenience – other people’s convenience. Browbeaten Cao (Hai-Qing) is offloaded by her brother on to Ma (Wu Renlin), the humblest of peasants, with little more than a donkey to his name. But against all expectations, a tender bond develops between them. Together, they eke out a life governed by the rhythms of the natural world, finding in their marriage a solicitude and comfort that had been denied them both until now. It’s a gorgeous, quietly affecting film that finds an unassuming beauty in this simple life in rural China, but which doesn’t shy away from the extreme hardships faced by the very poorest. A sleeper hit domestically, it reaches UK and Irish audiences having recently been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/28/return-to-dust-chinese-hit-film-about-rural-hardships-disappears-from-streaming-platforms">unceremoniously pulled from Chinese streaming services</a>, a victim, it is suggested, of a tightening official control over unflattering depictions of Chinese life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/06/return-to-dust-review-paean-to-the-simple-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Elizabeth Banks and Sigourney Weaver are charismatic in Phyllis Nagy’s directorial debut, about a group of women in the 60s providing abortions outside the law</p><p>Brisk, upbeat and brimming with positivity, <em>Call Jane</em> is both emphatically timely – it deals with an undercover band of women in the late 60s and the early 70s who provided safe abortions outside the law – and tonally somewhat jarring. The directorial debut of Phyllis Nagy (previously best known as the screenwriter of Todd Haynes’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/29/carol-review-todd-haynes-cate-blanchett-rooney-mara">Carol</a></em>) was presumably conceived as a stirring, factually based period piece. But since the seismic changes in the reproductive rights landscape in the US, it is a subject that takes on an urgency that feels a little at odds with the peppy, upbeat approach of the storytelling. This, of course, is hardly the fault of the film-makers, or of this entertaining, if not exactly heavyweight, movie.</p><p>The very watchable combination of Elizabeth Banks, as a suburban Chicago housewife turned illegal abortion technician, and Sigourney Weaver, as the founder of “Call Jane”, brings a force of charisma that overrides the picture’s occasional frothiness. And the grainy, richly saturated look of the picture – it was shot on film – plus the meaty soundtrack choices, floods the film with swaggering 60s authenticity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/06/call-jane-review-timely-if-occasionally-jarring-abortion-drama">Continue reading...</a>

Earthy flavours bring welcome depth to the autumn menu<p>You need a couple of minutes without any distractions to fry a batch of fresh curry leaves. You close the kitchen door, pour a thin film of oil into a wide, shallow-sided pan and place it over a moderate flame. Strip them from their coarse stems, then rain the tiny, emerald-green leaves into the hot oil and stand back while they crackle and pop, then gradually calm themselves. (A lid will help here, but remove it once they stop spluttering.) Shake the pan, watching carefully until each leaf is translucent and lightly crisp. Lift them out with a draining spoon on to a piece of kitchen paper.</p><p>You will be left with a pile of crackling, twisted, dark green leaves and a kitchen filled with a warm and smoky perfume. (I did suggest you close the door.) The window between perfection and burnt leaves is a heartbeat, so don’t take your eyes from the pan for a second.

It’s somewhere in the middle of all that, like politics always is, so it’s almost as if it’s an idea not worth expressing and the various sages would have been no less illuminating if they’d just said: “I’m standing on the ground because of the effect of gravity.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/06/labour-should-reverse-on-not-reversing-brexit-keir-starmer">Continue reading...</a>

Mistimed, irresponsible and tacky, the latest series of The Crown is simply bad television<p>At first, when I saw all the criticism levelled at Netflix’s fifth series of <em>The Crown</em>, mainly dealing with the period the then-Prince Charles and Princess Diana finally divorced, I shrugged: it seemed to have a brilliant cast (Imelda Staunton, Dominic West, Jonathan Pryce, Lesley Manville), how bad could it be? Now I’ve watched all 10 episodes, the answer quite simply is: (ouch) bad. And so tasteless it’s enough to make the staunchest republican wince in sympathy for the royals.</p><p>It’s ironic that the trailer booms: “The royal family is in genuine crisis.” The same could be said of Peter Morgan’s creation. Of course, there’s an element of overkill to some of the criticism. <em>The Crown</em>, basically a big-budget royal soap, has (finally) been forced to admit it’s a “fictionalised dramatisation”, so the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/oct/21/judi-dench-netflix-the-crown-fictional-dramatisation" title="">likes of Dame Judi Dench</a> need to get over the inaccuracies. Lest we forget, the first two series, starring Claire Foy and Matt Smith, sexed up the royal family to a risible degree (where was all the righteous indignation then?). If the next series is made, <em>The Crown</em> would hardly be the first to portray Diana’s death. Elsewhere, the hypocrisy is deafening: the media has been “reimagining” true/untrue royal stories forever, so it needs to get off its high horse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/06/i-never-dreamed-netflix-could-leave-me-wincing-sympathy-royal-family">Continue reading...</a>

Shocking new figures reveal the ugly truth that the circumstances of early years, from a baby’s weight to family ties, matter too much<p>Judge the vitality and health of a society by the way it treats its young. Every kid has a god-given talent that can be grown into something that will allow her or him to give, to contribute, and whose exercise of it will make them feel great – and enrich the rest of us. A teacher to whom I owe a lot used to say that, trusting every student will have a particular and unique talent, his task was to find it and make it flower.</p><p>The one thing you can say with confidence about contemporary Britain, with its over-appeasing of the interests, shibboleths and prejudices of the old, is that while that spirit may exist in the top 10%, who shower material and psychic gold on their young, it has an ever smaller chance of expressing itself the further down one travels in our all-too-steep income hierarchy.

<p>The celebrated novelist offers insights into his ways of working, his direct style and the moments that shaped him in this intriguing book on writing</p><p>On an April afternoon in 1978, Haruki Murakami was sitting in the stands of Jingu Stadium in Tokyo watching a baseball game when he underwent a life-changing epiphany. It happened just as a player for his local team struck a ball into left field, to the delight of the home crowd. “In that instant,” he writes, “and based on no grounds whatsoever, it suddenly struck me: <em>I think I can write a novel</em>.”</p><p>Within six months, Murakami had written his first book, a short novel called <em>Hear the Wind Sing</em>. He sent the only manuscript copy to <em>Gunzo</em>, a Japanese literary journal, and promptly forgot about it. On receiving the news that he had been shortlisted for <em>Gunzo</em>’s prestigious Prize for New Writers, he went for a walk with his wife and experienced another unlikely epiphany. It happened just after he had rescued an injured pigeon he had found on a back street and was cradling the frightened bird in his arms. “That’s when it hit me,” he recalls in <em>Novelist As </em><em>a Vocation,</em> a collection of essays on writing, inspiration and creativity, “I was going to win the prize. And I was going to go on to become a novelist who would enjoy some degree of success.”</p><p><em>Novelist As a Vocation</em> by Haruki Murakami is published by Harvill Secker (£18.99).

<p>The heartbreaking disappearances of eight men from Toronto’s gay district is turned into a truly unedifying bit of rubbernecking </p><p>Whisper it, but the true-crime documentary bubble may have burst. There are now objectively more documentaries than there is actual crime, and this is manifesting itself in a peculiar way. In the old days (read: about 18 months ago), the best way to identify a bad true-crime documentary was to look up the crime online. If you could learn more about it from a five-minute Wikipedia scan than by sitting through an entire series, that told you the show’s worth.</p><p>But now that the true-crime genre has been overloaded, there is another way. That is to scroll to the bottom of Wikipedia and see how many other shows have previously been made about the same crime. You see, film-makers are now so busy crawling over one another for scraps that there are very few crime stories being told for the first time. Maybe there was a film about it, or a dramatisation. There will almost certainly have been other documentaries made and, conservatively, about seven or eight hundred podcasts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/06/santa-claus-the-serial-killer-review-bbc-three">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Just two dizzying years after bringing the nation to a standstill in lockdown lodestone Normal People, Paul Mescal has become an indie film star everyone wants to work with. How did it happen? He talks to Aaron Hicklin</p><p>The actor Paul Mescal is a lucky man – his words, not mine. In the course of our conversation – mid-morning in London for him, pre-dawn in New York for me – he uses the word “lucky” at least eight times to describe his life and career. He was very lucky to go to school in Maynooth, Ireland, where it was compulsory to audition for the school musical. Lucky, also, to graduate from drama school at the precise moment that BBC Three was casting for <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/normal-people" title="">Normal People</a></em>, the first bona fide hit of the pandemic and the show that turbo-charged Mescal’s career. And he was “very, very lucky” that playing Connell Waldron in that lockdown lodestone would bring him to the notice of three young directors: Charlotte Wells, who cast him in this year’s indie darling, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/21/aftersun-review-beach-holiday-with-paul-mescal-and-daughter-is-a-sunny-delight" title="">Aftersun</a></em>, and Saela Davis and Anna Rose Holmer, the duo behind <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/19/gods-creatures-review-emily-watson-and-paul-mescal-shine-in-doom-laden-drama" title="">God’s Creatures</a></em>, in which Mescal inhabits the movie’s heart of darkness as Brian O’Hara, a returning son wreaking havoc on the dynamics of a remote Irish fishing village.</p><p>“I’m very much not a religious person,” Mescal says, over Zoom. “But that role did feel like it was delivered by some higher power in terms of what it represented.” What it represented was the antithesis of Connell, a character that transformed him into a heart-throb and tabloid catnip. Brian O’Hara, in contrast, is definitely not the kind of character to inspire Instagram tributes. No fangirls or fanboys would wish to be the silver chain around his neck.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/nov/06/masculinity-can-be-expresssed-in-many-ways-paul-mescal-interview-aftersun">Continue reading...</a>

There is no perfect solution to immigration but one thing is clear: don’t dehumanise<p>On one thing, Suella Braverman is right. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/31/embattled-braverman-insists-she-is-not-at-fault-for-manston-crisis" title="">system is broken</a>. But about almost everything else, she is grievously wrong, especially about the reasons for it being so. The cause of the brokenness is not a surge of migrants and asylum seekers, still less an “invasion”, but the result of a policy that, both deliberately and accidentally, has turned a manageable situation into a crisis.</p><p>For all the recent hysteria, the number of asylum seekers coming to Britain is far fewer than in the relatively recent past. Unquestionably, the numbers crossing the Channel in small boats have increased dramatically – from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/irregular-migration-to-the-uk-year-ending-december-2021/irregular-migration-to-the-uk-year-ending-december-2021" title="">299 in 2018</a> to possibly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/factsheet-small-boat-crossings-since-july-2022/factsheet-small-boat-crossings-since-july-2022" title="">50,000</a> this year. But a rise in the visibility of asylum seekers is not the same as a rise in numbers. People cross in small boats because other routes – by the Channel tunnel, by ferries or by air – have been sealed off. We know from experience that when one route is closed, migrants and asylum seekers seek out other, often more dangerous, paths.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/06/sealed-borders-are-fantasy-and-talk-of-invasion-is-toxic-there-is-an-alternative">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The French pop star has endured the death of his mother, record industry resistance and a backlash after adopting male pronouns. In an emotional interview, he talks about the struggle to understand himself and the music he makes</p><p>There are some musicians who seem made for, and by, their work, who make music that lives through them, from their toes to the tip of their quivering quiff. Redcar, formerly known as Chris, also known as Christine and the Queens, and born Héloïse Letissier (a name he still occasionally uses), is one of those. Pure, intimate vocals, exceptional songwriting, a gift for theatrics and a dancing ability that moves from Michael Jackson to <em>West Side Story</em> via <em>Cabaret’s</em> MC has taken Christine and the Queens from French-speaking niche outsider to the mainstream. Singles Tilted (2014), from debut album <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/28/christine-and-the-queens-chaleur-humaine-review" title="">Chaleur Humaine</a></em>, and Girlfriend (from <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/23/christine-and-the-queens-chris-review" title="">Chris</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/23/christine-and-the-queens-chris-review" title="">, 2018</a>) are the most well-known tracks, though true fans have enjoyed more outre offerings, such as the video for 5 Dollars, where we watch our hero(ine) donning bondage gear before putting on a man’s suit.</p><p>I interviewed him on stage in London in 2018 for the release of his second album and the outpouring of love from the young, mostly queer audience was palpable and moving. That was when he was Chris, a woman playing with masculine tropes, who wondered about switching between female and neutral pronouns. “My journey with gender has always been tumultuous,” he told the <em>New York Times </em>earlier this year. Then, in August, Chris took to social media to announce that “je me genre au masculin” (“I self-gender as male”) and would be using male pronouns from then on. About the same time, he started calling himself Redcar, or Red, rather than Chris. This name comes from the cars he kept seeing when his mum died, and forms part of the title of his new album, <em>Redcar Les Adorables Étoiles</em>. The album is sung mostly in French, with a splashy, open 1980s sound, hooks galore and much musing on love and sex. I love it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/06/christine-and-the-queens-redcar-interview-adorables-etoiles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Turkish photographer Olgaç Bozalp’s playful images examine how migration alters our view of the world</p><p>Olgaç Bozalp grew up in Konya, a city in central Turkey. Twice a year in his teens he would make the journey to Istanbul, 12 hours on the bus, just to experience a sense of freedom. “My personality didn’t necessarily fit into a small-town mentality,” he says of those years. As soon as he could he moved, first to Cyprus to study theatre and then settled in London, working as a photographer. “I didn’t move away until I was 19, but I always felt there was something for me beyond those borders.”</p><p>Bozalp’s new series of photographs, <em><a href="https://void.photo/store/p/leaving-one-for-another">Leaving </a></em><em><a href="https://void.photo/store/p/leaving-one-for-another">One for Another</a></em>, is a meditation on the extremes of that impulse, a study of the hope and trauma of migration. Many of his pictures focus on the detritus of escape – ad hoc sculptures made of life jackets on beaches, people almost comically laden with all their worldly goods or spilling out of knackered cars. Playfulness leaches into something more desperate.</p><p><em>Leaving One for Another</em> is published by<a href="https://void.photo/store/p/leaving-one-for-another"> Void</a> (€45)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/nov/06/the-big-picture-men-in-burqas-in-search-of-a-better-life">Continue reading...</a>

A Republican midterm landslide is the last thing a divided, angry America needs<p>From one perspective, the historical significance of this Tuesday’s US midterm elections should not be overstated. Anticipated Republican gains, and a consequent loss of Democratic control of Congress, would, if they materialise, be <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/3715441-coming-totally-predictable-utterly-normal-republican-midterm-sweep/" title="">nothing out of the ordinary</a>. The party in power usually performs poorly at the midpoint of the election cycle, especially if the sitting president is unpopular – and Joe Biden, with a disapproval rating of 55%, certainly is.</p><p>Viewed another way, however, the immediate significance of the vote for an angry, divided America that split roughly 51%-47% between Biden and Donald Trump in 2020 cannot be overestimated. The backdrop is looming economic recession, pessimism about the future, deep schisms over race, abortion rights, crime, guns and climate – and rising political violence fuelled by disinformation, far-right pundits, conspiracy theorists and paramilitary militias.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/06/observer-view-dangerous-moment-american-democracy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ex-president strikes familiar notes at Pennsylvania rally as he swipes at potential rival ‘Ron DeSanctimonious’ and effectively kicks off another run for White House</p><p>A Boeing 757 plane halted on the runway with “Trump” emblazoned on the side in giant gold letters. Loudspeakers boomed Elvis Presley’s Dixie, Village People’s YMCA and Lee Greenwood’s God Bless the USA. Donald Trump descended stairs to rapturous cheers and whistles from thousands of supporters.<br /><br />Officially, the former US president was rallying at a regional airport to support Republicans candidates in Tuesday’s midterm elections. Unofficially, he was already accelerating down the runway of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/03/donald-trump-white-house-2024-midterm-elections">a 2024 campaign for the White House</a>.<br /><br />But it was not quite takeoff. “I’m not going to say it right now,” said Trump, bringing a tantalised crowd in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, to their feet. “So, everybody, I promise you, in the very next – very, very, very short period of time, you’re going to be so happy.”<br /><br />He would like to do it, he added, but wanted to keep the focus on the party’s candidates. Yet minutes earlier, he had given the game away. Two giant screens displayed a series of polls including one for the Republican primary nomination in 2024 that showed Trump at 71% and Florida governor Ron DeSantis at 10%. Trump said casually but pointedly: “Ron DeSanctimonious at 10%.”</p><p>The nickname branding exercise was classic Trump and effectively fired the starting gun for a race in which DeSantis is widely considered his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/28/ron-desantis-florida-governor-republicans-trump">most formidable primary challenger</a>. On Sunday Trump will headline a rally in Miami, Florida, to bolster Senator Marco Rubio – but DeSantis, running for re-election as governor, is not invited.<br /><br />First, on Saturday, Trump was fighting old battles in Pennsylvania, where both his predecessor and successor – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/30/barack-obama-midterms-democrats-campaign-rally">Barack Obama</a> and Joe Biden – were also campaigning to tip the balance in a closely contested midterm race that could determine control of the Senate.<br /><br />Trump’s rally was held at <a href="https://palmerairport.com/">Arnold Palmer Regional Airport</a>, named after a golfing great who learned to fly there. Supporters flew giant “Trump 2024” flags and wore caps and T-shirts with slogans such as “Trump won”, “Lions not sheep” and “I’m a Trump Girl: Get Over It”. There were chants of “USA! USA”, “Let’s go Brandon!” – rightwing code for insulting Biden – and, at mention of Hillary Clinton, “Lock her up!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/06/trump-speeds-down-runway-of-presidential-bid-as-he-stumps-for-midterm-election-picks">Continue reading...</a>
