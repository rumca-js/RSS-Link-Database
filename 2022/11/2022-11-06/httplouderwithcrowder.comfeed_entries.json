Pratt, who has seen what a craphole Los Angeles has turned into, has made an endorsement in the Los Angeles Mayoral race. He has endorsed Rick Caruso. <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-06-02/rick-caruso-2022-mayoral-election-republican-transformation\" target=\"_blank\">The former Republican</a>. Who only switched to Democrat this year when he decided to run for mayor.</p><p>He's running against Karen Bass, the lifelong Democrat who is endorsed by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Caruso is the \"right-leaning\" candidate by default.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c0b95\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=32051863&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>\"I've lived in LA for over 20 years. It's been great to me.

If you live here, you know exactly what I'm talking about.\"</p><p>Pratt went on to say he doesn't \"normally support political candidates, but in this election, there is too much to lose.\"</p><p>The actor continued that if you are a Los Angeles voter, \"I urge you to vote for Rick Caruso. He's a builder. He knows how to get sh*t done. He's the guy for our city. Rick Caruso for LA Mayor.\"</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6ce11\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32051869&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>Pratt is not a dummy. He knows how he not only trends for saying anything the slightest bit right-leaning, he trends for saying things that aren't right-leaning at all but leftists assign right-leaning things to him because doesn't validate the progressive agenda. He'll trend just because he was cast in a movie, and leftists will get upset \"yeah, but what about that time he went to church.\"</p><p>The best Chris knows this going to make some noise. But like New York City, Los Angeles has become such a crime-infested sinkhole he felt the need to speak up.</p><p>Chris Pratt endorse Rick Caruso, who was GOP until he decided to run for mayor in Los Angeles.
