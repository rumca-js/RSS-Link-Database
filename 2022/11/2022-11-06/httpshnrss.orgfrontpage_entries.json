We\u2019re building an open-source pricing & packaging engine for SaaS with a built-in billing system. (<a href=\"https://github.com/uselotus/lotus\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/uselotus/lotus</a>).<p>We strongly believe pricing is the largest untapped growth lever for SaaS, primarily because pricing affects so many critical systems that don\u2019t talk to each other (billing, payments, feature limits, metering, and CRM). We\u2019re building this infrastructure to fix this and enable quick experimentation.<p>Lotus acts as a central repository for all of your pricing plans and utilizes your payment gateway, to manage usage-based, per-seat, and custom enterprise pricing. We\u2019re excited to open-source this because we want to enable developers to build their custom pricing and integration edge cases on top of this base.<p>We\u2019ve launched this repo under an MIT license so any developer can use the tool. Give it a spin for us at either:<p>* test our cloud version at (<a href=\"https://demo.uselotus.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://demo.uselotus.io</a>)<p>* self-host here (<a href=\"https://github.com/uselotus/lotus\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/uselotus/lotus</a>) \nand let us know what you think.<p>All feedback is appreciated! If the project is especially relevant to you, follow us and we\u2019ll keep you updated when we\u2019ve fully published all our beta features.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

I would imagine this would be hardest as it would need millions of dollars for this? Is there a way to get around it or using free tools like colab?<p>- Running the api. Once the model is trained, would it be possible to run it on a lenovo type laptop? I guess you need lots of VRAM to run it?<p>Final question is will a home brewed version be just as good?

with headers from step 3, add header keys to signed headers, then sum256 hash the payload and hex encode it.<p>Then you create a sign, add algorithm, request date time that is formatted with ISO8601 but all special characters stripped apart, add credential scopes, hash the canonical request you created at the first step.<p>Then, you calculate this abomination:\nHMAC(HMAC(HMAC(HMAC(\"AWS4\" + kSecret,\"20150830\"),\"us-east-1\"),\"iam\"),\"aws4_request\")<p>after that you calculate this:\nsignature = HexEncode(HMAC(derived signing key, string to sign))<p>after that you create an

It was a special feeling, because it was a sense of connection. Just being online and being part of the few select communities that existed back then was a commitment, and I believe that's in part what made it feel special.<p>With all the world gaining access to the internet, I think we've gained a lot, but lost this sense of wonder: Since online interactions have now become commonplace to the point of para-social meaninglessness, any single post or message doesn't really feel all that _real_.<p>HN is still the closest thing I know to that primordial kind of internet, and so I'm putting this post out there. It might get buried instantly, or it might survive, and on the off chance that it does:<p>I encourage you to comment here about whatever you're passionate about at the moment, however niche it might be. It might let you find some likeminded people and maybe recapture a bit of the best aspects of the internet in those early days.<p>In any case, I sincerely wish you a great day, from one surprisingly-real-but-currently-text-based being to another :)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a
