They had, however, learned a valuable lesson. Money can buy you a lot of things in sport. Major events. Lavish stadiums. Impressive infrastructure. But it cannot guarantee a competitive national football team.</p><p>That harsh reality was dispensed in clinical style by an unheralded Ecuador side, who breezed to a 2-0 lead – thanks, in part to Qatar’s erratic goalkeeper, Saad al-Sheeb – before taking their foot off the pedal.

<p>This American remake of the BBC comedy is less thoughtful, less nuanced, less … good. But the brilliance of its premise means it’s still fun</p><p>Ghosts is a British sitcom that was destined to be remade in the US. That is because remakes are about buying up formats and so much of what makes the show good is in the cleverly constructed premise. A young city-slacker couple move into a crumbling country house they have inherited unexpectedly, only to find it haunted by the spirits of people from various historical eras who have died there. The woman can see and hear them but her other half can’t. Bingo: it’s a gang/houseshare comedy, a historical romp and an imaginary-friend farce all in one.</p><p>It was the perfect vehicle for its creators, the British troupe previously known for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/horrible-histories">Horrible Histories</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/mar/06/yonderland-box-set-review">Yonderland</a>. Can it work for a phalanx of little-known US comedy actors? Yes and no: Ghosts US (BBC Three/iPlayer) is a decent showcase for its cast and it can’t kill the charm of the original, but what was delightful in the original show is now just pleasant and what was unique is generic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/20/bbc-ghosts-us-review-remove-the-original-sitcoms-best-bits-and-you-have-this">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For Qatar, this was a letdown 12 years in the making. The host nation has spent that time building the infrastructure of a World Cup shrouded in controversy and replete with a bitter taste that, whatever the next four weeks bring, is unlikely ever to be washed away. But when they kicked this tournament off the hope locally was for a bravura show from the meticulously constructed football project that has run concurrently with the creation of a manicured, deeply unsettling fantasy sporting land from sand. Instead the national team flopped, left for dust by a stronger and cannier Ecuador unit who dealt the hardest of truths about how life at this level really looks.</p><p>The manoeuvres honed by Félix Sánchez’s players over their time together were barely evident and it was doubly ignominious for Qatar that they became the first home side ever to lose an opening game. In truth no other outcome seemed likely after the moment, three minutes in, when Enner Valencia thought he had twisted the narrative with a close-range header. The goal was eventually disallowed bv VAR for the most borderline of offsides but Qatar’s backline, and especially their goalkeeper Saad al-Sheeb, already looked ripe to be picked off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/20/qatar-ecuador-world-cup-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

If Beckham had pulled out as a Qatar World Cup ambassador before the start of the event, Lycett was offering to donate £10,000 of his own money to gay charities.

<p>With the deadly devastation fresh in the world’s mind, Pakistan pushed for damage funds with other frontline countries</p><p>In early September, after unprecedented rainfall had left a third of Pakistan under water, its climate change minister set out the country’s stall for Cop27. “We are on the frontline and intend to keep loss and damage and adapting to climate catastrophes at the core of our arguments and negotiations. There will be no moving away from that,” Sherry Rehman said.</p><p>Pakistan brought that resolve to the negotiations in Sharm el-Sheikh and, as president of the G77 plus China negotiating bloc, succeeded in keeping developing countries united on loss and damage – despite efforts by some rich countries to divide them. Its chief negotiator, Nabeel Munir, a career diplomat, was backed by a team of savvy veteran negotiators who had witnessed the devastation and suffering from the floods, which caused $30bn (£25bn) of damage and economic losses. Every day, Munir repeated the same message: “Loss and damage is not charity, it’s about climate justice.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/20/loss-and-damage-pakistan-flooding-climate-justice-cop27">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bold shades and open spaces add lots of character to author Huma Qureshi’s 60s house</p><p>I cringe when people say it’s colourful,” says award-winning author <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/humaqureshi" title="">Huma Qureshi</a>. She’s perched on the edge of a blue sofa in the front room of her four-bedroom north London home, where she lives with her partner, Richard Birch, and their children. “It’s not! It’s considered. It’s intentional.” The floor tiles are a faded terrazzo yellow and the walls are pink, with pale green architraves framing the doorway leading into the kitchen-diner. In this home, neutrals serve as accent colours. There isn’t much white, grey or beige in sight, but she’s right, it’s not colourful, it’s brilliant. Behind her a collection of seven patterned wall plates hang next to the cover artwork for her 2021 memoir. “My friend Parul Arora did the cover for the book and she gave me the print,” she says. “These are my take on the plates my mum would buy on her travels and hang up in our family home. It was the sale of that home that led us to this house.”</p><p>Huma’s mother was downsizing from their family home in the Midlands and moving to north London to be closer to her children. This was during lockdown in 2020 and she wasn’t able to view houses, so they did it for her. “I saw a tired-looking house and half jokingly showed it to Richard, who is used to me sending him pictures of properties we could never ever live in. He said this actually looks interesting,” says Huma. They went to view it and she distinctly remembers that they were both struck by the light and the big windows on both sides, plus the spacious rooms. “At a certain point in the afternoon the sun comes into the house from the back and front, filling the centre so it glows. There were slices of sunlight coming through and it felt like a summer house. On holiday in Denmark, we fell in love with these traditional, black-painted summer houses and when we saw this place, we immediately knew we’d paint it black on the outside, too.” This is also why she decided on faded terrazzo floor tiles. “It’s as if they’ve been washed out by the sun over time and have been there for years.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/20/a-writers-colourful-home-has-a-story-to-tell">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A choreographer’s long estrangement from her father drives this compelling novel shaped by the 80s Aids crisis, written with detail by a former dancer</p><p>For Carlisle Martin, a dance-obsessed girl growing up with her mother in Ohio, an annual fortnight with her father and his boyfriend in their Greenwich Village home exuded impossible glamour. Stepping through Robert and James’s front door was her “favourite entrance to perform”, and life within – full of art, beauty and flatteringly age-inappropriate conversation – felt like a ballet. Then, one summer in her early 20s, Carlisle found herself banished from their world.</p><p>She hasn’t seen either man in almost two decades, and has made her own way as a choreographer, when James calls to summon her to her father’s deathbed. The cause of their estrangement is the driving mystery in <em>They’re Going to Love You</em>, <a href="http://www.mhowrey.com/about-2">Meg Howrey</a>’s fourth novel, a luminous chronicle of betrayal, sacrifice and creative ambition, framed by New York’s Aids crisis in the 1980s and some seriously complex family dynamics.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/20/theyre-going-to-love-you-by-meg-howrey-review-a-new-york-story-of-ballet-and-betrayal">Continue reading...</a>

## What exactly does that Paris Olympic mascot look like? The French have decided – and it is not a cheery hat | Emma Beddington

<p>The joyfully bizarre – and saucy –<em> phryges</em> have got even me excited about a month of sport</p><p>The Paris 2024 Olympics and Paralympics mascots have been unveiled and boy, they do not disappoint. <em>Les phryges</em> are modelled on the revolutionary red Phyrgian bonnet, the one Liberty wears in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Leading_the_People#/media/File:Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix_-_Le_28_Juillet._La_Libert%C3%A9_guidant_le_peuple.jpg">the famous Delacroix painting</a>. There’s a “We might cut your head off” edginess to the <em>phryges</em> that is wonderfully at odds with their “immaculate smiles” and “big blue eyes that end in [revolutionary] rosettes”, as Radio France has described them. I have never seen more cheerful hats.</p><p>France is united in seeing them differently: with their “curved protuberance at the front” (Radio France again), <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/15/mascot-paris-olympic-games-2024-likened-to-clitoris-in-trainers-phryges">social media is convinced they look like giant clitorises</a>.

The pair of them look distinctly … post-coital? The cartoon <em>phryge</em>, flaunting its curved protuberance, has its tongue poking out and is sweating; Riner appears to be tenderly cupping one of its little feet. They both look very happy: the heart has its reasons, as Pascal said.</p><p>Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/20/paris-olympic-mascot-french-phryges-sport">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bills will cause many to think twice about turning on the heating this winter. How does the body adapt to cold – and will wearing a hat really help?</p><p>We, along with other mammals and birds, are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507838/">endotherms</a>. We use thermoregulation to maintain a consistent internal body temperature – between 37C and 37.5C. When the external environment changes, “A range of physiological responses is initiated, including the reduction of tissue temperature – skin, blood and muscle,” says Dr Joseph Costello, exercise and environmental physiologist at Portsmouth University’s extreme environments laboratories. “If the exposure is over a longer period of time, you may also observe a reduction in deep body temperature.”</p><p>Thermoregulation is controlled by the hypothalamus, a structure deep in the brain that maintains internal balance – or homeostasis – by regulating processes such as heart rate and body temperature. If the hypothalamus senses the body growing cold, it sends signals to the skin, glands, muscles and organs, kickstarting responses that will keep the body warm and protect the vital organs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/nov/20/cold-comfort-the-science-of-staying-warm-in-the-energy-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

Her debut album, 2017’s <em><a href="https://honeydijon.bandcamp.com/album/the-best-of-both-worlds-1">Best of Both Worlds</a></em>, played as a rousing microcosm of these multihour sets, and in the years since its release, Dijon has become a sought-after producer, working this year on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/06/beyonce-renaissance-review-a-breathtaking-maximalist-tour-de-force">Beyoncé’s </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/06/beyonce-renaissance-review-a-breathtaking-maximalist-tour-de-force">Renaissance</a>.</em></p><p>Harnessing this collaborative experience, <em>Black Girl Magic </em>finds Dijon expanding her sound to incorporate a wider range of queer Black contributions to dancefloor culture, producing a 15-track masterclass in disco, new jack swing and soulful house. The driving drumbeat and piano chord stabs of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvBkn1wVNDQ">Love Is a State of Mind</a> set the hands-in-the-air tone. Standout features from the house pioneer Mike Dunn on the righteous thump of Work and from rapper Channel Tres on the sultry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzgTOlAWdQY">Show Me Some Love</a> keep the pace moving, while the ecstatic disco of Everybody forms the album’s highlight. Here, Dijon sing-shouts a joyous refrain that calls for everybody to come together in service to an infectious synth-bass melody. It’s the perfect example of her slick production style, blending raucous energy with artful arrangement designed to play loud and get you moving. Hearing <em>Black Girl Magic, </em>the dancefloor is wherever you happen to be. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/20/honey-dijon-black-girl-magic-review-eclectic-dancefloor-delights">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘Each game will be incredible,’ insists the Wales captain as he gets ready to fulfil his childhood ambition after long wait</p><p>He is the boy from Whitchurch, north Cardiff, about to lead Wales on the world stage.

But a moment that perhaps seemed as though it would elude a glittering, superstar career stacked with honours and individual accolades is finally here. Towards one end of the Corniche, Doha’s opulent waterfront, an industrial-sized image of Bale, plastered on to the facade of a sparkling skyscraper, glistens above the city.</p><p>Bale remains a big deal, a commercial entity in his own right, but the fire in him to prove he can still do the business on the pitch burns brightly.

<p>A bunch of ultra-wealthy foodies get more than they bargained for in this riotous black comedy starring Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy</p><p><em>Succession</em> director Mark Mylod has an acute eye for the absurdity of extreme privilege. So the preposterous world of haute cuisine is almost too easy a target: not so much about eating as worshipping at the altar of the chef’s ego. The chef in this case is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/ralphfiennes">Ralph Fiennes</a>, sporting joylessly immaculate whites and an expression of patrician displeasure. The guests at his culinary temple, run with a cult-like devotion by the ferocious front of house manager Elsa (Hong Chau), are a tasteless bunch: a trio of braying investment bankers, a needy movie star, a miserable wealthy couple trying to buy some meaning into their lives. And then there’s Margot (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/anya-taylor-joy">Anya Taylor-Joy</a>), the last-minute date of foodie fanboy Tyler (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/nicholas-hoult">Nicholas Hoult</a>).

If this tale of three girls who camp out for the night in a suburban garden is at moments melancholic, it’s also quietly funny. We liked her characters’ expressive faces, and her sure way with bathos; it also chimed with experiences we all remembered having ourselves.</p><p>“I’m so thrilled to win,” she says, still sounding a bit amazed. “It’s honestly a dream come true. To have such a platform, to be published in a national newspaper. It’s the biggest break I could have. I was in a state of shock when I got the call. When I first started getting into comics at university, <em>Shortcomings</em> by Adrian Tomine [one of the judges for this year’s prize] was about the third book I read, so to know that he liked my story really means something.” It was, she tells me, agony keeping her victory a secret when she attended <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/13/pow-why-female-writers-are-a-top-draw-in-the-world-of-comics">the Thought Bubble festival</a> in Yorkshire last week.

<p>With this important memoir cum manifesto, the Nobel peace prize-winning journalist who took on Facebook and the murderous Duterte regime in the Philippines exposes the abuse of power</p><p>The Filipino-American Maria Ressa may physically be a diminutive figure (5ft 2in in stockinged feet) but she is a moral giant. In 2021, she was one of two journalists (the other being the Russian Dmitry Muratov) to be awarded the Nobel peace prize for their efforts to “safeguard freedom of expression” in their respective countries. She thus joins two other journalists in a select pantheon of earlier winners: the Yemeni Tawakkol Karman, who shared the prize with two other women in 2011, and the German reporter Carl Ossietzky, who was honoured in 1935 for his reporting of German rearmament under Hitler. Ossietzky was unable to collect his prize because the regime refused him permission to travel to Norway, and he died in 1938 after enduring years of torture and mistreatment in Nazi concentration camps.</p><p>Ressa was given the award for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/08/war-reporting-was-easier-maria-ressas-journey-to-nobel-prize-winner">her fearless reporting</a> of the corruption and brutality of the Duterte regime in the land of her birth, the Philippines. If the president of that unfortunate country had concentration camps at his disposal, she would assuredly be in one of them. In their absence, the regime has had to be content with convicting her for a crime she did not commit (based on an article she did not write, under a “cyberlibel” offence that did not yet exist), and issuing 10 arrest warrants. If found guilty of these other charges, her lawyer tells her, she could go to jail for more than a century. Since 2018, she has been wearing a bulletproof vest when on the road.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/20/how-to-stand-up-to-a-dictator-by-maria-ressa-review-tales-of-a-moral-giant">Continue reading...</a>

<p>James Gray’s engaging autobiographical tale set in 1980s New York boasts fine performances from Anne Hathaway, Jeremy Strong and Anthony Hopkins</p><p>Queens, 1980. The way James Gray tells it in this bustling, tobacco-hued autobiographical drama, it’s an in-between world, on the brink of the cultural explosion of hip-hop and the political paradigm shift heralded by Reaganism. But it’s also rooted further in the past and in the Jewish family history of Gray’s alter ego in the picture, sixth-grader Paul Graff (impressive newcomer Banks Repeta).</p><p>Paul is flirting with the notion of teen rebellion – he triggers a family argument with his unilateral decision to order Chinese food rather than to tackle his mother’s baked fish (“It’s called<em> </em><em>scrod</em>,” says his mother, swilling the word around her mouth like something she would prefer to spit out). At school he bonds with Johnny (Jaylin Webb), a Black kid who delivers the kind of scorched-earth comebacks to teachers that make the other children gasp with delighted horror. Paul wants to be an artist; Johnny would like to work for Nasa. And for a while, both ambitions seem achievable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/20/armageddon-time-review-worlds-collide-in-terrific-coming-of-age-drama-james-gray-anne-hathaway-jeremy-strong-anthony-hopkins">Continue reading...</a>

These two delicious double acts make the most of the season’s richest flavour pairings<p>I’m frying little rounds of coarsely minced pork in a pan, seasoned with lemon, mint and garlic, their edges turning sticky with caramelising meat juices. The plan, once they have all been browned, is to bake them in an earthenware casserole on a bed of onions, thyme and figs. I have introduced a little grated halloumi to the ground meat, which will feel very much at home with the figs and thyme, while keeping the meatballs sweet and juicy.</p><p>I like the opportunities given by a bag of mince, whether it be pork or lamb. You can take your dinner in so many directions, from the most homely of potato-topped pies to something where you have let your imagination and good taste guide you. The most popular use for mince in my kitchen is in a slow-cooked pasta sauce – the sort of recipe where time is as important as thyme – and quick suppers such as meatballs spiced with za’atar and lemon, or perhaps cumin, onions and garam masala.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/nov/20/nigel-slaters-recipes-for-pork-and-halloumi-balls-and-for-apple-and-blackberry-trifle">Continue reading...</a>

I’ll let you make up your own minds: <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-63600184">it’s that there’s an international airport in, or just outside, the village of Llandegley in Powys</a>. There isn’t really and so the joke is that there is and also that it has at least two terminals, two of which are called Terminal 1 and Terminal 3.</p><p>If you don’t think that’s funny, it may be my fault because I haven’t told it in the right way. The joke should be told, and for 20 years has been told, by a sign – a pretend sign. Or is it a real sign? It’s really there, unlike the airport. But it’s not directing people to anything real. Does that mean it’s not really a sign? Are signs that lie not signs? What are they then? Drawings? Is it art? Or fraud? This is the sort of philosophical question that comedy raises all the time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/20/in-serious-times-let-the-llandegley-international-airport-sign-be-our-guide">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The satirist on who makes him laugh, Tory attacks on the BBC, and the physics behind his sci-fi sitcom</p><p>Writer and director Armando Iannucci, 58, was born in Glasgow to Scottish-Italian parents. He studied philosophy and English before abandoning his doctorate at Oxford to pursue a comedy career. His Radio 4 news spoof with Chris Morris, <em>On </em><em>the Hour</em>, transferred to TV as <em>The Day Today</em>. Now a leading figure in British comedy, his creations include the Bafta-winning political comedy <em>The Thick of It</em>, its Emmy-winning US equivalent, <em>Veep</em>, and the films <em>The Death of Stalin</em> and <em>The Personal History of David Copperfield</em>. Iannucci’s sci-fi sitcom <em>Avenue 5</em> is about to return for a second series.</p><p><em><strong>The Day Today</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>The Thick of It</strong></em><strong> often seem prophetic. Do you ever look at current affairs and think, “That’s familiar”?<br /></strong>Yes, but if you go back and look at <em>Yes, Minister</em>, it’s the same old stories: Europe, cuts, fights with the Treasury. These things come back around. Fundamentally, it’s people spending so much time thinking about how they’re going to gain power that they haven’t thought about what to do when they have it. They end up falling back on their set of beliefs from 20 years ago when they first went into politics, not realising the world’s changed and they’re desperately out of date.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/nov/20/armando-iannucci-adhd-scifi-avenue-5-interview">Continue reading...</a>

We spoke about the benefits of dating posh people and he said they always know good restaurants and then offered to take me to the pizza one his ex showed him. I joked that pizza is never that expensive even when it’s fancy and he said, “Exactly!” We talked and talked until the sky turned raspberry ripple colour and it was time to go home and I jumped in an Uber and he texted me on the way home saying that he liked my snake print boots. We messaged for a couple of days after that, until eventually he stopped replying.</p><p>A few years ago a situation like this would have materialised into a date.

Creamy Carol? Grainy Sue? Santa’s Favorite? Sometimes a witty name conjures up a lot more than just a great taste<p>There is going to be a stupendous amount of name dropping in this column. But as I once said to Obama, is it really name dropping if they are people you know? I’m in Copenhagen, where everyone seems really happy. I reflect on this to someone. ‘We are very happy,’ she affirms, ‘because everything works and there’s nothing to worry about.’ What must that be like?</p><p>In almost every supermarket/newsagent, there are dispensers of something called <strong><a href="https://shop.simplychocolatecph.com/en%0D" title="">Simply Chocolate</a></strong>. The first time I saw them, in Irma, a small chain of supermarkets (not as omnipresent as 7-Elevens and Joe the Juices, which were everywhere), I really fancied a Creamy Carol (who wouldn’t?), which is dark chocolate and caramel. But that had sold out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/nov/20/bars-with-crazy-names-bring-back-happy-memories">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Obama’s ‘disarmingly honest’ follow-up to the powerful autobiography Becoming shares her strategies for overcoming adversity</p><p>In her wonderful autobiography, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/18/becoming-by-michelle-obama-book-review-peter-conrad">Becoming</a></em>, Michelle Obama tells a story about the time her family visited some African American friends who had moved to a predominantly white area in the suburbs. At the end of the visit, Obama’s father discovered that “someone had scratched a line across the side of his beloved Buick, a thin ugly gulch that ran across the door and towards the tail of the car. It had been done with a key or a rock and was in no way accidental.”<br /><br />How did her father react to this almost certainly racist act? He just “carried on”, as he always did – because he was a “withstander”, someone who could take whatever life threw at him and find a way to keep going.<br /><em><br /></em><em>The Light We Carry</em>, the former first lady’s second book, is intended to be a practical guide to help us all be a bit more like her father (and like Obama herself) and learn to cope with adversity, be it prejudice, a pandemic or the chilling thought of Donald Trump re-entering the White House. In Obama’s words, the aim is to give readers a “glimpse inside my personal toolkit” – the strategies she uses to be “more comfortable, less paralysed, inside of uncertainty”.<br /><br />The book contains 10 of these techniques, ranging from “starting kind” (it’s best to ignore the first negative thought that comes into our heads in the morning and instead we should be “inviting” a “better and more tender one”) through to “the whole of us” (life is better when “we grip hands with another soul”). Miraculously, these self-help bromides don’t come across as cloying, mainly because Obama is so disarmingly honest about her fears, failures and all-too human flaws.<br /></p><p>She describes how out of place she felt as a rare African American undergraduate at Princeton in the 1980s, for example, and how in the dining hall she couldn’t help but fixate on what she “assumed were the thoughts running through other people’s heads: there goes the Black girl, looking for a seat”. As she freely admits, that kind of anxiety “can mess with your head if you let it”.<br /><br />Obama candidly tells us how her grandfather Dandy ended up being “petrified” and trapped by structural racism and hardly ever left his neighbourhood: “Our hurts become our fears. Our fears become our limits.” Breaking this cycle isn’t easy, especially if you’re the victim of discrimination, but Obama’s down-to-earth advice is to focus on the small things, which have the potential to “become an instrument for your own visibility, your own steadiness and sense of connection”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/20/the-light-we-carry-by-michelle-obama-review-a-guide-for-life-from-the-former-first-lady">Continue reading...</a>

There is nothing wrong with wrinkles, but older skin appreciates being replenished with nourishing potions<p>There comes a point when skin loses collagen and elasticity, and the renewal process completely slows down. That’s when that peachy, bouncy, bright and blemish-free face you once had seems like a distant memory. It is a big concern for many people, but if we are being honest, mainly women – hence “anti-ageing” is one of the most searched words on Google. But I have a lot of issues with the term “anti-ageing”. If I listed them all we’d be in <em>War and Peace</em> territory, but essentially I think this negative concept does us no favours. There is absolutely nothing wrong with ageing (surely, if nothing else it is a sign that you are still alive) and for the sake of the brands who continue to push a youth-obsessed agenda, wrinkles are not the worst thing to happen to a woman. I say all this knowing that it probably falls on many deaf ears because most women I know – particularly over 35 – want younger skin. So I’m not here to convince you to embrace your wrinkles, but I will advise a more positive approach. Think of skin in terms of replenishing and nourishing it so it is in optimal health. A hardworking serum from tried, tested and trusted brands like these will help. The formulas to look out for should include: peptides, to help with collagen and elastin production to give you plumper skin; Vitamin C is great for brightening; retinol is excellent for increasing skin cell turnover and smoothing skin texture, and niacinamide will improve skin tone. And, then, don’t forget the SPF. Because if there’s one thing that will slow down the process of ageing it’s a decent sunscreen. </p><p><strong>1.

<p>Charlotte Wells’s debut feature is a stylistically daring, emotionally piercing and beautifully understated tale of love and loss</p><p>Earlier this month, the debut feature from Scottish-born, New York-based writer-director Charlotte Wells picked up a whopping 16 nominations for the <a href="https://www.bifa.film/">British Independent Film awards</a>, an impressive haul second only to <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/11/saint-maud-review-a-chilling-nurse-on-a-mission-from-god">Saint Maud</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/11/saint-maud-review-a-chilling-nurse-on-a-mission-from-god">’s</a> record-breaking performance in 2020. It’s easy to see why <em>Aftersun</em> has generated such excitement since premiering at Cannes in May. A brilliantly assured and stylistically adventurous work, this beautifully understated yet emotionally riveting coming-of-age drama picks apart themes of love and loss in a manner so dextrous as to seem almost accidental. Don’t be fooled; Wells knows <em>exactly</em> what she’s doing, and her storytelling is as precise as it is piercing.</p><p>We meet young, separated father Calum (<em>Normal People</em>’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/nov/06/masculinity-can-be-expresssed-in-many-ways-paul-mescal-interview-aftersun">Paul Mescal</a>) and his 11-year-old daughter, Sophie (screen newcomer Frankie Corio), on holiday together in Turkey in the late 1990s. Sophie is smart for her age (she and Calum are sometimes mistaken for siblings) but she’s still also very much a child, torn between hanging out with the younger kids at the resort or with the more boisterous teenagers who lounge around the pool table. As for Calum, his outward calm seems to cover demons of denial; a trancey energy that threatens to break through the placid surface of his current life, dragging him back into a more chaotic – or euphoric – existence (<em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/19/moonlight-review-five-star">Moonlight</a> </em>director and <em>Aftersun </em>co-producer Barry Jenkins describes Calum as “wading through wells of quiet anguish”).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/20/aftersun-review-charlotte-wells-luminous-father-daughter-drama-paul-mescal">Continue reading...</a>

After all the out-there sexiness of contemporary culture, it’s a relief to relax into the warm embrace of twee once again<p>It both calms me and pains me, the home of the Berenstain Bears. A modest detached property, one room on each floor, built sensitively into the trunk and wide green branches of a tree. There are wooden steps leading up to the front door, and the window shutters are painted pink, and it sits in a vast empty field, surrounded by mountains. As my little son idles on my lap and we read about the bears’ multiple failed picnics, these days I often feel myself being dragged there, through the paper, which smells of bread, into the field, printed long ago in ink, and to the treehouse, where I would perhaps hibernate under some sort of homemade quilt.</p><p>This impulse, this need to escape, to a magical world of softness that gives off its own light, is something I see reflected online. It’s partly seasonal, but it’s also I think, a reaction to what came before, as most things seem to be. Rather than girl bosses or hot girls, women on social media currently aspire to be, largely, middle-aged mice getting cosy in a tiny bed. Or woodland creatures snuggling into a chair made of a nutshell, or something adorable sheltering under a cookie. Twee – the aesthetic last popular in the early 2000s, its signature accessories cardigans and berets, its queen Zooey Deschanel and her fellow <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/16/manic-pixie-dream-girls-writer-apologises" title="">Manic Pixie Dream Girls</a> – has returned. TikTok (nostalgia-machine and home of every microtrend) thrums with twee fashion, with its precious whimsy and ukeleles and corduroy and girliness – it’s back, but this time its lazy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/20/twee-is-back-are-you-ready-for-a-snug-in-a-bug-winter">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The photographer’s curious tableau fuses the nostalgic and comic in a portrait of his home village near Grenoble</p><p>The village of Prabért is a small community east of Grenoble in the French Alps. It is also a place that comes alive in the imagination of Thomas Rousset, who grew up there and became a photographer. Rousset studied his art at college in Lausanne, Switzerland, and came back to Prabért every weekend to do his “homework”. That practice developed over a decade to become a surreal evocation of rural French life in which everyday details and the inhabitants of Prabért become elements in almost hallucinatory scenes. This one, included in Rousset’s new book <em>Prabérians</em>, is typical. The villagers at the table in their kitchen studying the hen are both old family friends of Rousset’s and actors in his tableau of Prabért life.</p><p>The tone of Rousset’s work is constantly shifting. Sometimes, the pictures look like exercises in nostalgia for an ancient community under threat from gentrification and the influx of ski-chalet owners; sometimes, they seem like comic constructions, private takes on fairytale ideas of country life; sometimes, they gesture towards blunter documentary. Ideally, Rousset suggests, all these elements – which reflect his own attitude to the place he fell to earth – are in play at once. He talks of “ambiguous overlapping of realities” and places where “routine and strangeness dovetail”. <em>Prabérians</em>, he says, is both “a resolutely utopian world” and “the result of a sudden awareness of how shallow the notion of community” has become.</p><p><em><a href="https://loosejoints.biz/products/praberians">Prabérians </a></em><a href="https://loosejoints.biz/products/praberians">by Thomas Rousset is published by Loose Joints (£48)</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/nov/20/the-big-picture-thomas-roussets-surreal-image-of-french-rural-life">Continue reading...</a>
