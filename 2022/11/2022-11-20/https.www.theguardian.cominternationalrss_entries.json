Behind her a collection of seven patterned wall plates hang next to the cover artwork for her 2021 memoir. \u201cMy friend Parul Arora did the cover for the book and she gave me the print,\u201d she says. \u201cThese are my take on the plates my mum would buy on her travels and hang up in our family home.

This was during lockdown in 2020 and she wasn\u2019t able to view houses, so they did it for her. \u201cI saw a tired-looking house and half jokingly showed it to Richard, who is used to me sending him pictures of properties we could never ever live in. He said this actually looks interesting,\u201d says Huma. They went to view it and she distinctly remembers that they were both struck by the light and the big windows on both sides, plus the spacious rooms. \u201cAt a certain point in the afternoon the sun comes into the house from the back and front, filling the centre so it glows. There were slices of sunlight coming through and it felt like a summer house. On holiday in Denmark, we fell in love with these traditional, black-painted summer houses and when we saw this place, we immediately knew we\u2019d paint it black on the outside, too.\u201d This is also why she decided on faded terrazzo floor tiles. \u201cIt\u2019s as if they\u2019ve been washed out by the sun over time and have been there for years.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/20/a-writers-colourful-home-has-a-story-to-tell\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/20/theyre-going-to-love-you-by-meg-howrey-review-a-new-york-story-of-ballet-and-betrayal", "title": "They\u2019re Going to Love You by Meg Howrey review \u2013 a New York story of ballet and betrayal", "date_published": "2022-11-20 15:00:29+00:00", "description": "<p>A choreographer\u2019s long estrangement from her father drives this compelling novel shaped by the 80s Aids crisis, written with detail by a former dancer</p><p>For Carlisle Martin, a dance-obsessed girl growing up with her mother in Ohio, an annual fortnight with her father and his boyfriend in their Greenwich Village home exuded impossible glamour.

Trading in the four-to-the-floor kick drum that provides the aortic pulse to house music, Dijon\u2019s mid-tempo sets conduct her crowds perfectly from tantalising buildups to scattered breakdowns and communal euphoria as her soaring melodies kick in. Her debut album, 2017\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://honeydijon.bandcamp.com/album/the-best-of-both-worlds-1\">Best of Both Worlds</a></em>, played as a rousing microcosm of these multihour sets, and in the years since its release, Dijon has become a sought-after producer, working this year on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/06/beyonce-renaissance-review-a-breathtaking-maximalist-tour-de-force\">Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/06/beyonce-renaissance-review-a-breathtaking-maximalist-tour-de-force\">Renaissance</a>.</em></p><p>Harnessing this collaborative experience, <em>Black Girl Magic </em>finds Dijon expanding her sound to incorporate a wider range of queer Black contributions to dancefloor culture, producing a 15-track masterclass in disco, new jack swing and soulful house. The driving drumbeat and piano chord stabs of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvBkn1wVNDQ\">Love Is a State of Mind</a> set the hands-in-the-air tone. Standout features from the house pioneer Mike Dunn on the righteous thump of Work and from rapper Channel Tres on the sultry <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzgTOlAWdQY\">Show Me Some Love</a> keep the pace moving, while the ecstatic disco of Everybody forms the album\u2019s highlight. Here, Dijon sing-shouts a joyous refrain that calls for everybody to come together in service to an infectious synth-bass melody. It\u2019s the perfect example of her slick production style, blending raucous energy with artful arrangement designed to play loud and get you moving. Hearing <em>Black Girl Magic, </em>the dancefloor is wherever you happen to be. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/20/honey-dijon-black-girl-magic-review-eclectic-dancefloor-delights\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/20/welsh-first-minister-defends-trip-world-cup-qatar-mark-drakeford", "title": "Welsh first minister defends trip to World Cup in Qatar", "date_published": "2022-11-20 12:50:36+00:00", "description": "<p>Mark Drakeford insists people of Wales would want nation\u2019s leader to attend despite controversies</p><p>The Welsh first minister has defended his decision to travel to Qatar for the World Cup, saying he feels that the citizens of Wales want their country\u2019s leader there despite concerns about human rights and working conditions.</p><p>Speaking in Doha on Sunday, Mark Drakeford admitted that the decision to attend was finely balanced but he said he believed it would have been wrong to leave seats allocated to the Welsh government at the opening ceremony and matches unoccupied.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/20/welsh-first-minister-defends-trip-world-cup-qatar-mark-drakeford\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/nov/20/f1-abu-dhabi-grand-prix-live", "title": "F1: Abu Dhabi Grand Prix \u2013 live", "date_published": "2022-11-20 12:40:54+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>Race at the Yas Marina Circuit begins at 1pm GMT</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/19/max-verstappen-takes-pole-at-abu-dhabi-grand-prix-as-red-bulls-dominate-f1\">Verstappen takes pole in Abu Dhabi as Red Bulls dominate</a></li><li>Share your thoughts with Alex <a href=\"mailto:alex.hess@theguardian.com\">via email</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/a_hess\">on Twitter</a></li></ul><p><strong>Some pre-race reading</strong> on Russell after his maiden GP win last week: </p><p><strong>Vettel\u2019s curtain-call:</strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/nov/20/f1-abu-dhabi-grand-prix-live\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/20/cop27-summit-climate-crisis-global-heating-fossil-fuel-industry", "title": "The 1.5C climate goal died at Cop27 \u2013 but hope must not", "date_published": "2022-11-20 12:31:04+00:00", "description": "<p>Every fraction of a degree increases human suffering, so the fight to end the fossil fuel industry must ramp up</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2022/nov/19/cop27-fears-15c-target-danger-negotiations-overrun-live\">Cop27 live \u2013 latest news updates</a></li></ul><p>When the history of the climate crisis is written, in whatever world awaits us, Cop27 will be seen as the moment when the dream of keeping global heating below 1.5C died.</p><p>Does that mean giving up?

If this tale of three girls who camp out for the night in a suburban garden is at moments melancholic, it\u2019s also quietly funny.

At the end of the visit, Obama\u2019s father discovered that \u201csomeone had scratched a line across the side of his beloved Buick, a thin ugly gulch that ran across the door and towards the tail of the car. It had been done with a key or a rock and was in no way accidental.\u201d<br /><br />How did her father react to this almost certainly racist act?

In Obama\u2019s words, the aim is to give readers a \u201cglimpse inside my personal toolkit\u201d \u2013 the strategies she uses to be \u201cmore comfortable, less paralysed, inside of uncertainty\u201d.<br /><br />The book contains 10 of these techniques, ranging from \u201cstarting kind\u201d (it\u2019s best to ignore the first negative thought that comes into our heads in the morning and instead we should be \u201cinviting\u201d a \u201cbetter and more tender one\u201d) through to \u201cthe whole of us\u201d (life is better when \u201cwe grip hands with another soul\u201d). Miraculously, these self-help bromides don\u2019t come across as cloying, mainly because Obama is so disarmingly honest about her fears, failures and all-too human flaws.<br /></p><p>She describes how out of place she felt as a rare African American undergraduate at Princeton in the 1980s, for example, and how in the dining hall she couldn\u2019t help but fixate on what she \u201cassumed were the thoughts running through other people\u2019s heads: there goes the Black girl, looking for a seat\u201d. As she freely admits, that kind of anxiety \u201ccan mess with your head if you let it\u201d.<br /><br />Obama candidly tells us how her grandfather Dandy ended up being \u201cpetrified\u201d and trapped by structural racism and hardly ever left his neighbourhood: \u201cOur hurts become our fears. Our fears become our limits.\u201d Breaking this cycle isn\u2019t easy, especially if you\u2019re the victim of discrimination, but Obama\u2019s down-to-earth advice is to focus on the small things, which have the potential to \u201cbecome an instrument for your own visibility, your own steadiness and sense of connection\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/20/the-light-we-carry-by-michelle-obama-review-a-guide-for-life-from-the-former-first-lady\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/nov/20/world-cup-2022-countdown-to-kick-off-and-latest-news-live", "title": "World Cup 2022: countdown to kick-off and latest news \u2013 live", "date_published": "2022-11-20 08:48:11+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>Qatar open tournament against Ecuador at Al Bayt Stadium</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/19/fifa-gianni-infantino-world-cup-qatar\">\u2018I feel gay, disabled \u2026 \u2019: Infantino makes bizarre attack on critics</a></li><li>Share your thoughts with Alex <a href=\"mailto:alex.hess@theguardian.com\">via email</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/a_hess\">on Twitter</a></li></ul><p><strong>Managing Brazil at a World Cup</strong> \u2013 the hardest job in football?

That\u2019s when that peachy, bouncy, bright and blemish-free face you once had seems like a distant memory. It is a big concern for many people, but if we are being honest, mainly women \u2013 hence \u201canti-ageing\u201d is one of the most searched words on Google. But I have a lot of issues with the term \u201canti-ageing\u201d. If I listed them all we\u2019d be in <em>War and Peace</em> territory, but essentially I think this negative concept does us no favours. There is absolutely nothing wrong with ageing (surely, if nothing else it is a sign that you are still alive) and for the sake of the brands who continue to push a youth-obsessed agenda, wrinkles are not the worst thing to happen to a woman. I say all this knowing that it probably falls on many deaf ears because most women I know \u2013 particularly over 35 \u2013 want younger skin. So I\u2019m not here to convince you to embrace your wrinkles, but I will advise a more positive approach. Think of skin in terms of replenishing and nourishing it so it is in optimal health. A hardworking serum from tried, tested and trusted brands like these will help. The formulas to look out for should include: peptides, to help with collagen and elastin production to give you plumper skin; Vitamin C is great for brightening; retinol is excellent for increasing skin cell turnover and smoothing skin texture, and niacinamide will improve skin tone. And, then, don\u2019t forget the SPF. Because if there\u2019s one thing that will slow down the process of ageing it\u2019s a decent sunscreen. </p><p><strong>1.

It is also a place that comes alive in the imagination of Thomas Rousset, who grew up there and became a photographer. Rousset studied his art at college in Lausanne, Switzerland, and came back to Prab\u00e9rt every weekend to do his \u201chomework\u201d. That practice developed over a decade to become a surreal evocation of rural French life in which everyday details and the inhabitants of Prab\u00e9rt become elements in almost hallucinatory scenes. This one, included in Rousset\u2019s new book <em>Prab\u00e9rians</em>, is typical.

Sometimes, the pictures look like exercises in nostalgia for an ancient community under threat from gentrification and the influx of ski-chalet owners; sometimes, they seem like comic constructions, private takes on fairytale ideas of country life; sometimes, they gesture towards blunter documentary. Ideally, Rousset suggests, all these elements \u2013 which reflect his own attitude to the place he fell to earth \u2013 are in play at once. He talks of \u201cambiguous overlapping of realities\u201d and places where \u201croutine and strangeness dovetail\u201d. <em>Prab\u00e9rians</em>, he says, is both \u201ca resolutely utopian world\u201d and \u201cthe result of a sudden awareness of how shallow the notion of community\u201d has become.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://loosejoints.biz/products/praberians\">Prab\u00e9rians </a></em><a href=\"https://loosejoints.biz/products/praberians\">by Thomas Rousset is published by Loose Joints (\u00a348)</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/nov/20/the-big-picture-thomas-roussets-surreal-image-of-french-rural-life\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/19/bob-woodward-donald-trump-tapes", "title": "\u2018It\u2019s on the tape\u2019: Bob Woodward on the criminality of Donald Trump", "date_published": "2022-11-20 07:00:19+00:00", "description": "<p>The great Washington Post reporter has published 20 interviews he conducted with the then president \u2013 who is now running again</p><p>Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water.
