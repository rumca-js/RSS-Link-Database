Our president is old AF. He's no different than any other eighty-year-old. He has memory issues. Communication issues. Coherency issues. Continence issues. The difference is he has all those things, along with access to the nuclear codes. So to celebrate our president's birthday, here are some of our favorite moments of his. </p><p>Ok, maybe "celebrate" is the wrong word.</p><p>There was a time he was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-acciddent-news-report" target="_blank">accidentally identified as a child predator</a>.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Happy 80th Birthday Joe Biden! <a href="https://t.co/38xgOOiiLQ">pic.twitter.com/38xgOOiiLQ</a><br />‚Äî Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1594342503465250816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>When reached for comment, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-karate-little-girl" target="_blank">this little girl said</a> "HI-YAH!"</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">ICYMI - A little girl "karate blocked" Biden at the national Thanksgiving Turkey Pardoning. <a href="https://t.co/oqIQ33dHll">pic.twitter.com/oqIQ33dHll</a><br />‚Äî The Dirty Truth (Josh) (@AKA_RealDirty) <a href="https://twitter.com/AKA_RealDirty/status/1462249265875595269?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2021</a></blockquote> </div><p>Joe Biden likes to wander aimlessly.

In Biden's so-called "Inflation Reduction Act" that increases inflation, the government will give you $7500 to signal that virtue in buying a car that is now $8500 more expensive in some places. Just hope they don't catch fire.</p><p>You're screwed when that happens. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/batteries-hurricane-ian-florida" target="_blank">As is everyone around you</a>.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">A Tesla caught on fire on I-80 in Clearfield County today. It took two hours of continuous water to put it out, according to Morris Township Fire Company. ‚ÄúThis vehicle burnt so hot and long that if it was not for the rims you might not even of know it was a vehicle.‚Äù <a href="https://t.co/2cX6TEX6y0">pic.twitter.com/2cX6TEX6y0</a><br />‚Äî Geoff Rushton (@GeoffRushton) <a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffRushton/status/1592694527109865473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The incident occurred on the Pennsylvania Highway. <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/tesla-explodes-into-flames-on-pennsylvania-highway-requires-24x-more-water-to-extinguish-than-gas-car" target="_blank">The Daily Wire</a> reports the family driving the car ran over a piece of debris in the road. That's all it took to cause the car to catch fire and spew toxic fumes into the air. </p><p>It took over 12,000 gallons of water to put the fireball out. Your gas-powered car would take less than 500 gallons. Also, gas-powered cars tend not to catch fire by running over something in the road.</p><p>According to a statement from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/morristownshipfireco/?__cft__%5B0%5D=AZU-Wao9BNue8u8xIyjchB6mudD2hA-E9M3Q-ro637m1sJjweDe19hlr3f72792ko52KjzxJoTUDxZYrjnfFHPfZaLvs_ObsPDWBt89LfSmFPS8nqtPk_TqQ0ZdXUTzjme0sARrUGYoUl6VtO1_xI9Wr&amp;__tn__=-UC%2CP-R" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Morris Township Volunteer Fire Company</a>: "Due to the lithium ion battery on the vehicle, extinguishing this fire would require additional tankers as the vehicle would continue to reignite and burn fiercely at times. In total it took crews nearly two hours of continually applying water on the vehicle as the battery would begin to reignite and hold high temperatures."</p><p>Electric vehicles struggle to perform <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/electric-vehicle-colordo-wyoming" target="_blank">basic car</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ford-electric-truck-total-disaster" target="_blank">truck functions</a>. You are <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/california-electric-vehicles" target="_blank">at the mercy of the government as to when you can charge them</a>. The car companies will <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tesla-sends-warning-owners" target="_blank">send you messages from the government</a> to remind you they control your car. And, on occasion, they explode.</p><p>If none of those things matter to you, get an electric vehicle. They are better for the planet or something.</p><p><p>

## Elon Musk reinstates Trump on Twitter and the left's having a hissyfit even before Trump's first tweet back

Elon Musk <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-trump-twitter" target="_blank">telegraphed that it would happen</a>. He <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-twitter-poll" target="_blank">took a poll to see if the people wanted it</a>. And the results were overwhelming. Professional edgelord and sh*tposter Donald Trump has his Twitter account back.</p><p>During his time as President of the United States, Trump would spend his days live-tweeting cable news and retweeting anyone who said nice things about him. Then on one arbitrary day in January 2021 -- I think it was the 8th -- Twitter's now former top lawyer, executive, and speech cop <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/wapo-saagar-enjeti" target="_self">Vagina Goode</a> (I don't feel like looking up how to spell her real name, so I'm going with what Alex Jones calls her) decided to permanently ban his account. </p><p>It's now November 2022. Goode is gone. Trump is back. And the left can't deal! Trump hasn't even fired off a new tweet yet and the left is already in full meltdown.</p><p>The guy who plays Olaf is unhappy with the warm hug Elon gave to the former president. He lashed out at Musk for the decision.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">You are truly an asshole and an anarchist. <a href="https://t.co/YuGMtEPal4">https://t.co/YuGMtEPal4</a><br />‚Äî Josh Gad (@joshgad) <a href="https://twitter.com/joshgad/status/1594141973618622464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>A guy most known for being a meathead, dead from the neck up, is being a bit of a drama queen about it.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Elon Musk is letting a man who led a violent Insurrection to overthrow the United States Government back on this platform.

He has TruthSocial now. And both the haters and the losers already share screen captures of his "truths" as their "tweets." The left is in a pre-emptive meltdown while Trump weighs his options.</p><p>EXIT QUESTION: If Trump does come back to Twitter, what do you think his first tweet will be? Sound off in whatever common section of whatever social media app brought you here.</p><p><p>
