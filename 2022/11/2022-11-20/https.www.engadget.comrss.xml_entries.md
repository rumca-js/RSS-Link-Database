<p>Following an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/immortality-delayed-august-30th-213206816.html"><ins>Xbox Series X/S and PC release</ins></a> this past summer, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/immortality-release-window-xbox-game-pass-180425379.html"><em><ins>Immortality</ins></em></a>, the latest project from <em>Her Story</em> creator Sam Barlow, is now available on Android and iOS via Netflix. Provided you subscribe to the streaming service, you can download the game at no additional charge and experience one of the most <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/immortality"><ins>highly acclaimed titles of 2022</ins></a>.</p><p>Like Barlow’s past projects, <em>Immortality </em>is a love letter to the full-motion video games of the ‘90s. The game tasks you with finding out the fate of fictional actress Marissa Marcel. You’ll need to piece together what happened to her by watching clips from three unreleased films and behind-the-scenes footage. Barlow recruited Allan Scott and Amelia Gray, best known for their work on <em>Queen’s Gambit </em>and <em>Mr. Robot, </em>to help write the story of <em>Immortality</em>. So if you’re a sucker for a good story, this one is worth checking out.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="846f7d32860d4e2b989bd50c1fb20cda"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p>

## COP27 conference approves historic climate damage fund for developing nations

<p>Following two weeks of negotiations that felt doomed to go nowhere, the COP27 climate conference delivered a breakthrough deal to help developing nations cope with the often catastrophic effects of climate change. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/11/19/cop27-climate-conference-summit-deal/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=wp_main"><em><ins>The Washington Post </ins></em><ins>reports</ins></a> dignitaries agreed to create a “loss and damage fund” in the early hours of Sunday morning after two extra days of negotiations. The Alliance of Small Island States, an organization that includes countries whose <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tuvalu-climate-change-metaverse-174104228.html"><ins>very existence is threatened by climate change</ins></a>, called the agreement “historic.” However, as with the Glasgow Climate Pact that came out of last year’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cop26-climate-change-glasgow-pact-212507731.html"><ins>COP26 conference</ins></a>, the consensus is that COP27 failed to deliver the action that is desperately needed to meet the demands of the current moment.</p><p>For one, the conference failed to see nations agree to new and stronger commitments to reduce their carbon emissions. According to <em>The Post</em>, China and Saudi Arabia were strongly against language calling for a phaseout of all fossil fuels, as were many African nations. Alok Sharma, the chair of COP26, said (via <a href="https://phys.org/news/2022-11-cop27-summit-historic-fund-climate.html"><em><ins>Phys.org</ins></em></a>)  a clause on energy was "weakened, in the final minutes.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The conference also left many of the most important details related to the loss and damage fund to be sorted out by a committee that will need to answer some difficult questions in the coming months. Among the issues that need to be decided on is how much the United States, historically the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/contributed-most-global-co2"><ins>greatest emitter of greenhouse emissions globally</ins></a>, should pay out to vulnerable countries. The conference also ended without a clear commitment from China to pay into the fund.</p><p>The committee now has a year to draft recommendations for next year’s climate meeting in Dubai. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said governments took “an important step towards justice,” but fell short in pushing for the commitments that would ultimately protect the world’s most vulnerable people from the worst effects of climate change. "Our planet is still in the emergency room," Guterres said. "We need to drastically reduce emissions now and this is an issue this COP did not address."</p>

<p>Autonomous vacuum maker iRobot is a lot like Tesla, not necessarily by reinventing an existing concept — vacuums, robots and electric cars all existed before these two companies came on the scene — but by imbuing their products with that intangible quirk that makes people sit up and take notice.

Published by Princeton University Press. Copyright © 2022. All rights reserved.</p><hr /><h2>The Code That Launched a Million Cat Videos&nbsp;</h2><h3>by Lowen Liu</h3><p></p><p>According to Colin Angle, the CEO and cofounder of iRobot, the Roomba faced some early difficulties before it was rescued by two events. The disc-shaped robot vacuum had gotten off to a hot start in late 2002, with good press and a sales partner in the novelty chain store Brookstone. Then sales started to slow, just as the company had spent heavily to stock up on inventory. The company found itself on the other side of Black Friday in 2003 with thousands upon thousands of Roombas sitting unsold in warehouses.&nbsp;</p><p>Then around this time, Pepsi aired a commercial starring comedian Dave Chappelle. In the ad, Chappelle teases a circular robot vacuum with his soft drink while waiting for a date. The vacuum ends up eating the comedian’s pants—schlupp. Angle remembers that at a team meeting soon after, the head of e-commerce said something like: “Hey, why did sales triple yesterday?” The second transformative moment for the company was the rapid proliferation of cat videos on a new video-sharing platform that launched at the end of 2005. A very specific kind of cat video: felines pawing suspiciously at Roombas, leaping nervously out of Roombas’ paths, and, of course, riding on them. So many cats, riding on so many Roombas. It was the best kind of advertising a company could ask for: it not only popularized the company’s product but made it charming. The Roomba was a bona fide hit.&nbsp;</p><p>By the end of 2020, iRobot had sold 35 million vacuums, leading the charge in a booming robot vacuum market.</p><p>The Pepsi ad and the cat videos appear to be tales of early days serendipity, lessons on the power of good luck and free advertising. They also appear at first to be hardware stories— stories of cool new objects entering the consumer culture. But the role of the Roomba’s software can’t be underestimated. It’s the programming that elevates the round little suckers from being mere appliances to something more. Those pioneering vacuums not only moved, they decided in some mysterious way where to go. In the Pepsi commercial, the vacuum is given just enough personality to become a date-sabotaging sidekick. In the cat videos the Roomba isn’t just a pet conveyer, but a diligent worker, fulfilling its duties even while carrying a capricious passenger on its back. For the first truly successful household robot, the Roomba couldn’t just do its job well; it had to win over customers who had never seen anything like it.&nbsp;</p><p>Like many inventions, the Roomba was bred of good fortune but also a kind of inevitability. It was the brainchild of iRobot’s first hire, former MIT roboticist Joe Jones, who began trying to make an autonomous vacuum in the late 1980s. He joined iRobot in 1992, and over the next decade, as it worked on other projects, the company developed crucial expertise in areas of robotics that had nothing to do with suction: it developed a small, efficient multithreaded operating system; it learned to miniaturize mechanics while building toys for Hasbro; it garnered cleaning know-how while building large floor sweepers for SC Johnson; it honed a spiral-based navigation system while creating mine-hunting robots for the US government. It was a little like learning to paint a fence and wax a car and only later realizing you’ve become a Karate Kid.&nbsp;</p><p>The first Roombas needed to be cheap—both to make and (relatively) to sell—to have any chance of success reaching a large number of American households. There was a seemingly endless list of constraints: a vacuum that required hardly any battery power, and navigation that couldn’t afford to use fancy lasers—only a single camera. The machine wasn’t going to have the ability to know where it was in a room or remember where it had been. Its methods had to be heuristic, a set of behaviors that combined trial and error with canned responses to various inputs. If the Roomba were “alive,” as the Pepsi commercial playfully suggested, then its existence would more accurately have been interpreted as a progression of instants—<em>did I just run into something? Am I coming up to a ledge? And if so, what should I do next?</em> All conditions prepared for in its programming. An insect, essentially, reacting rather than planning.&nbsp;</p><p>And all this knowledge, limited as it was, had to be stuffed inside a tiny chip within a small plastic frame that also had to be able to suck up dirt. Vacuums, even handheld versions, were historically bulky and clumsy things, commensurate with the violence and noise of what they were designed to do. The first Roomba had to eschew a lot of the more complicated machinery, relying instead on suction that accelerated through a narrow opening created by two rubber strips, like a reverse whistle.&nbsp;</p><p>But the lasting magic of those early Roombas remains the way they moved. Jones has said that the navigation of the original Roomba appears random but isn’t—every so often the robot should follow a wall rather than bounce away from it. In the words of the original patent filed by Jones and Roomba cocreator Mark Chiappetta, the system combines a deterministic component with random motion. That small bit of unpredictability was pretty good at covering the floor—and also made the thing mesmerizing to watch. As prototypes were developed, the code had to account for an increasing number of situations as the company uncovered new ways for the robot to get stuck, or new edge cases where the robot encountered two obstacles at once. All that added up until, just before launch, the robot’s software no longer fit on its allotted memory. Angle called up his cofounder, Rodney Brooks, who was about to board a transpacific flight. Brooks spent the flight rewriting the code compiler, packing the Roomba’s software into 30 percent less space. The Roomba was born.</p><p>In 2006 Joe Jones moved on from iRobot, and in 2015 he founded a company that makes robots to weed your garden. The weeding robots have not, as yet, taken the gardening world by storm. And this brings us to perhaps the most interesting part of the Roomba’s legacy: how lonely it is.&nbsp;</p><p>You’d be in good company if you once assumed that the arrival of the Roomba would open the door to an explosion of home robotics. Angle told me that if someone went back in time and let him know that iRobot would build a successful vacuum, he would have replied, “That’s nice, but what else did we really accomplish?” A simple glance around the home is evidence enough that a future filled with robots around the home has so far failed to come true. Why? Well for one, robotics, as any roboticist will tell you, is hard. The Roomba benefited from a set of very limited variables: a flat floor, a known range of obstacles, dirt that is more or less the same everywhere you go. And even that required dozens of programmed behaviors.&nbsp;</p><p>As Angle describes it, what makes the Roomba’s success so hard to replicate is how well it satisfied the three biggest criteria for adoption: it performed a task that was unpleasant; it performed a task that had to be done relatively frequently; and it was affordable. Cleaning toilets is a pain but not done super frequently. Folding laundry is both, but mechanically arduous. Vacuuming a floor, though—well, now you’re talking.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet for all the forces that led to the creation of the Roomba, its invention alone wasn’t a guarantee of success. What is it that made those cat videos so much fun? It’s a question that lies close to the heart of the Roomba’s original navigation system: part determinism, part randomness. My theory is that it wasn’t just the Roomba’s navigation that endeared it to fans—it was how halting and unpredictable that movement could be. The cats weren’t just along for an uneventful ride; they had to catch themselves as the robot turned unexpectedly or hit an object. (One YouTuber affectionately described the vacuum as “a drunk coming home from the bar.”) According to this theory, it’s the imperfection that is anthropomorphic. We are still more likely to welcome into our homes robots that are better at slapstick than superhuman feats. It’s worth noting that the top-of-the-line Roomba today will map your rooms and store that map on an app, so that it can choose the most efficient lawnmower-like cleaning path. In these high-end models, the old spiral navigation system is no longer needed. Neither is bumping into walls.&nbsp;</p><p>Watching one of these Roombas clean a room is a lot less fun than it used to be. And it makes me wonder what the fate of the Roomba may have been had the first ever robot vacuum launched after the age of smartphones, already armed with the capacity to roll through rooms with precise confidence, rather than stumble along. It’s not always easy, after all, to trust someone who seems to know exactly where they are going.</p>

<p>Air fryers have been having a moment, and today, there's no shortage of machines to choose from. Earlier this year, we set out to find the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-air-fryers-133047180.html">best air fryers</a> available now, and we came across a handful of models that impressed us. Our top pick of the bunch, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDk2TjI4U1pQP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tN2ctMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImNmNDA1Zjk2LTM4NGMtNDNlZS05YTQxLWMzZWE0OGM4YjI3NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQ8uMKjhBLWNAVrv8nBwx41NrZ0uLyX8BAUG7uPO1seB&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB096N28SZP%3Fth%3D1">Instant Vortex Plus</a>, is one of the best for most people — and now you can pick it up at its lowest price yet. Amazon has the six-quart Instant Vortex Plus for only $100, which is 41 percent off its regular rate.</p><p></p><p>This air fryer comes from the makers of the Instant Pot, so you can safely assume this machine doesn't stop at air frying alone. It has six cooking modes — air fry, roast, broil, bake, reheat and dehydrate — and it has a temperature range of 95 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. That should let you cook all kinds of foods in it, and with the six-quart machine, you'll have enough room to cook quite a bit of food at once. In our testing, we found that the Vortex Plus took little to no time to preheat, and we liked its intuitive controls and easy-to-clean basket.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Vortex Plus has two additional features that help it stand out from other air fryers in this price range. It has a "ClearCook" window on the front of its basket, which essentially just lets you see inside the machine while it's cooking. Most other pod-shaped air fryers don't have this, and it could come in handy if you like to make sure your food is cooked precisely a certain way. There's also the brand's "odor ease" technology that uses built-in replaceable air filters to remove smells during cooking. We found that it didn't completely eliminate smells, but compared to other, bigger machines, the Vortex Plus' output seemed less smokey overall.</p><p>The discounted Vortex Plus joins a number of <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9zdG9yZXMvcGFnZS9ENUNGQUI0Qy0yRDA1LTQ3MzktQTg5My0wMDdERkM3RERBNUU_aW5ncmVzcz0yJnZpc2l0SWQ9MmVmNTQ4MDAtYjYzOC00MjIxLTg5YzYtMTk2NzI3YmU4ZDBiJnJlZl89YXN0X2JsbiZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby03Zy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiY2Y0MDVmOTYtMzg0Yy00M2VlLTlhNDEtYzNlYTQ4YzhiMjc2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAZVDf_kTGWl7cqaHoTWRnKIrRS8WNlnMA7uLtNN48mpN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2FD5CFAB4C-2D05-4739-A893-007DFC7DDA5E%3Fingress%3D2%26visitId%3D2ef54800-b638-4221-89c6-196727be8d0b%26ref_%3Dast_bln">other Instant Pot gadgets</a> on sale for Black Friday.

devices in one connected audio system. We gave the Arc a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-010039560.html">review score of 85</a> back in 2020: It's the company's largest soundbar and its most expansive, particularly with Dolby Atmos content. The Beam also supports Atmos, but since it's smaller and lacks the Arc's upward-firing drivers, it can't deliver quite as much detail or bass power.

They pair quickly and seamlessly with iPhones (in a process very similar to that of AirPods), and you can digitally label them with the name of the thing they're monitoring.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After that quick setup process, you can see the last known location of your things from within the Find My app, and you'll even get alerts when, say, you've left your keys behind when you (and your iPhone) have moved to another location. From your phone, you can force AirTags to emit a chime to help you find your lost items more easily, and those with the latest iPhones can get on-screen directions to their missing things (as long as they aren't too far away).</p><p>Our biggest gripe with AirTags is a very Apple-y one: the trackers don't have a keyring hole, so you have to put them in a case, sleeve or another holder if you want to attach them to anything. Thankfully, most of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">our favorite AirTag cases</a> are even cheaper than the tracker itself, so it may be a good idea to pick up a case for your loved one to whom your also gifting the AirTag.</p><p>Also, it goes without saying that AirTags are only viable for people with iPhones, or those otherwise steeped in the Apple ecosystem. Thankfully, there are a number of other options out there for non-Apple users, including those from <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9zdG9yZXMvcGFnZS80NENDOTU4MS01NzY3LTQ0NTctQUUzOC1BQjUwNTQ0N0YzRUU_aW5ncmVzcz0yJnZpc2l0SWQ9ZjNmNmZlYjktYWQwZS00NjBhLTg4NmYtZDc0YzA4MTI1MWMzJnJlZl89YXN0X2JsbiZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby03ZS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZjVkZjkyYWUtNzYyYy00YmVlLTg0MWMtMDM3ZjE0OWQxM2E1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAffNwsgK27I7YOdeWNeqKvsZzzp0nUevPMcX2jkyExX7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2F44CC9581-5767-4457-AE38-AB505447F3EE%3Fingress%3D2%26visitId%3Df3f6feb9-ad0e-460a-886f-d74c081251c3%26ref_%3Dast_bln">Tile</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9zdG9yZXMvQ2hpcG9sby9wYWdlL0I4RTdEOEE4LTVCRTQtNEJDOS1CMjI2LTg5MzFDQzU0Nzk3RD9yZWZfPWFzdF9ibG4mdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tN2UtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImY1ZGY5MmFlLTc2MmMtNGJlZS04NDFjLTAzN2YxNDlkMTNhNSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAT9uxQ_bKM-9foTK4IW0qbnDoYgh1TKmKG6UdKrEds21&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2FChipolo%2Fpage%2FB8E7D8A8-5BE4-4BC9-B226-8931CC54797D%3Fref_%3Dast_bln">Chipolo</a> and <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9zdG9yZXMvcGFnZS9GNTBBRkFCQS00Q0RFLTRBOTUtODREMC1DQTRDNjE4MTlGRUIvc2VhcmNoP3JlZl89YXN0X2JsbiZ0ZXJtcz10cmFja2VyJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTdlLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmNWRmOTJhZS03NjJjLTRiZWUtODQxYy0wMzdmMTQ5ZDEzYTUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARgwReFPo9OC_yaialrW5FyoQI8vE1dC_jqEjAlVbIUu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2FF50AFABA-4CDE-4A95-84D0-CA4C61819FEB%2Fsearch%3Fref_%3Dast_bln%26terms%3Dtracker">Samsung</a>.</p><p><em>Get the latest </em><a href="https://engadget.com/black-friday/"><em>Black Friday</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyber-monday/"><em>Cyber Monday</em></a><em> offers by following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribing to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em>.</em></p>

The improved Transparency Mode is also the best we've tried on any wireless earbuds — it almost sounds like you're not wearing them at all when you enable this feature. That means you can more easily jump in and out of conversations, or just keep your AirPods in your ears for longer periods of time in between actively listening to music.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Otherwise, the new Pros are much the same as the previous models. You get deep integration with the Apple ecosystem, which is a big reason why some will choose these buds over others. Quick pairing and switching allows you to use them in between Apple devices seamlessly, and they have a decent, six-hour battery life. Their wireless charging case is both Qi-certified and MagSafe-compatible, so you have a lot of options when it comes to picking a charger for these buds. Overall, they're some of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">our favorite wireless earbuds</a> at the moment, and they'll be hard to beat for Apple fanatics.</p><p><em>Get the latest </em><a href="https://engadget.com/black-friday/"><em>Black Friday</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyber-monday/"><em>Cyber Monday</em></a><em> offers by following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribing to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em>.</em></p>

## Elon Musk says he will unban Donald Trump after Twitter poll

<p>A few weeks after he <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html">took over Twitter</a>, Elon Musk said he will fulfill <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-he-would-reverse-donald-trump-twitter-ban-182237750.html">one of his early promises</a> for the platform, reinstating Donald Trump’s account. The former president, who is running for the White House for a third time, will once again be allowed to tweet, Musk said.&nbsp;</p><p>Twitter's new CEO appeared to make the decision via a Twitter poll. On Friday night, Musk tweeted a poll asking people to vote on whether Twitter should reinstate the former President, who recently just revealed that he will run for the country's highest office again in 2024. "Vox Populi, Vox Dei," Musk said in a follow-up tweet. The phrase is Latin for "the voice of the people, the voice of God." Twenty-four hours later, the poll had closed, and Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1594131768298315777">announced</a> that Trump will indeed be reinstated.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The option to reinstate the former President won with 51.8 percent of the 15,085,458 votes. While the poll was ongoing, Musk said that it was <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1593893237873201152">getting one million votes</a> per hour, and also <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1593952814534991873">said </a> "bot and troll armies" were responsible for some of the activity.</p><div id="7b17732c323b40239b20ade199cc4a7d"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The people have spoken. <br /><br />Trump will be reinstated.<br /><br />Vox Populi, Vox Dei. <a href="https://t.co/jmkhFuyfkv">https://t.co/jmkhFuyfkv</a></p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1594131768298315777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>While Musk has long indicated he would allow Trump coming back onto the platform, he previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-moderation-council-elon-musk-193142274.html">pledged to form a moderation council</a> before reversing any permanent Twitter account bans. On November 18th, Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-unbans-jordan-peterson-babylon-bee-kathy-griffin-204407440.html">reinstated a few accounts</a>, including those belonging to Kathy Griffin and Jordan Peterson. At the time, he said no decision had been made about Trump.</p><p>Twitter booted Trump off the platform in early 2021 after he <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-donald-trump-tweets-warnings-violence-214418443.html">broke rules against inciting violence</a>. He violated Twitter's civic integrity policy by expressing support for the mob that stormed the Capitol on January 6th last year. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-suspends-donald-trump-001400097.html">His account was </a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-suspends-donald-trump-001400097.html">initially suspended</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-suspends-donald-trump-001400097.html">for 12 hours</a>. A couple of days later, in his final days in office, Twitter permanently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-banned-from-twitter-232502274.html">suspended Trump's personal account</a>. Trump has been unable to use the platform since, despite his attempts <a href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-banned-from-twitter-again-024724093.html">to skirt the ban</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/federal-judge-dismisses-trump-lawsuit-twitter-120654477.html">a failed lawsuit</a> that sought to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-sues-to-get-his-twitter-account-back-143200517.html">have his access restored</a>. It took Musk acquisition for Twitter for Trump to get his account back.</p><p>Trump's return may be as much of a business decision on Musk's part as much as anything. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-where-did-tweeters-go-twitter-is-losing-its-most-active-users-internal-2022-10-25/">a <em>Reuters </em>report</a> suggested that many of Twitter's heaviest users have moved away from the platform to the likes of Instagram and TikTok. Musk himself has noted that many of the most-followed Twitter accounts <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1512785529712123906">don't tweet often</a>.</p><p>For better or worse, Trump is a prominent figure and his tweets commanded attention. Whether advertisers will be glad to see Trump back remains to be seen. Just ahead of officially assuming control of Twitter, Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-advertisers-hellscape-172909516.html">sought to soothe any concerns</a> by stating that "Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences!”</p><p>In the wake of his actions surrounding January 6th, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facbook-donald-trump-joe-biden-155849567.html">Meta blocked Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts</a>. As things stand, that suspension is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-could-be-back-on-facebook-in-time-for-primaries-164200140.html">set to expire on January 7th, 2023</a> — just as the 2024 election cycle gets into full swing.&nbsp;</p><p>Since being <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-extends-trumps-suspension-043625570.html">de-platformed</a> from major services, Trump has turned his attention to smaller social networks, including his own app, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/truth%20social/">Truth Social</a>. Trump had pledged that he wouldn't return to Twitter, but with 88 million followers there, he commanded an audience almost 22 times the size of the one he has on Truth Social (a platform that, for what it's worth, <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/3678091-musk-knocks-trumps-truth-social-essentially-a-rightwing-echo-chamber/">Musk has described as</a> "essentially a right-wing echo chamber").</p><p>Twitter has gone through enormous changes since Musk took over the company. He has slashed the headcount by turfing out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-layoffs-010148183.html">thousands of employees</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-reportedly-cuts-contract-workers-173755779.html">contractors</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-fired-employees-called-out-elon-musk-063109091.html">some dissenters</a>. Several <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-privacy-security-executives-quit-twitter-blue-elon-musk-181237268.html">top executives</a> are among those who've departed. Around 1,200 more are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-hit-with-mass-resignations-after-elon-musk-hardcore-ultimatum-004304057.html">said to have left</a> after refusing to commit to Musk's vision of a "hardcore" Twitter 2.0 that would require working "long hours at high intensity." Trump's return won't exactly help to steady the ship.</p><p><em>Mariella Moon contributed to this post.</em></p>
