Now that things are getting back to almost normal, I thought I'd share it here and request feedback.  This is a very niche project for people who like the same things I do:  saxophones, Rust, mechanical keyboards and the Raspberry Pi.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33682813\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33682813</a></p>\n<p>Points: 12</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/motion/4f5f6a29-3af0-4d79-99a4-988ff7c5ba05?utm_source=hn", "title": "Motion (YC W20) Is Hiring Full Stack Engineers", "date_published": "2022-11-20 17:01:59+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/motion/4f5f6a29-3af0-4d79-99a4-988ff7c5ba05?utm_source=hn\">https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/motion/4f5f6a29-3af0-4d79-99a4-988ff7c5ba05?utm_source=hn</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33682743\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33682743</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33682599", "title": "Ask HN: What is example of good documentation in your opinion?", "date_published": "2022-11-20 16:50:34+00:00", "description": "<p>I know its kinda generic question, but what technical documentation you would point to as well written, concise, with good examples etc..

I filled in my email and my phone number, but to date I have not received a confirmation of receipt from Starlink. The payment was a direct transfer.<p>I have gone through the (not great) starlink support pages, and one can apparently only contact starlink through an account that becomes available through the confirmation email. Naturally I have none. It also states that if that confirmation email wasn't confirmed, the order would be cancelled after 7 days (it hasn't). There was no email in my Spam folder.<p>Now it's been over 3 weeks. I am a customer but as far as starlink is concerned, I am not. They obviously did their utmost best to not need a helpdesk, having generous procedures in place for when things fail. There is no one to talk to, not even a silly bot. This is all great when it works, but when you fall on the side where things don't work as intended, as I do now, it doesn't exactly feel great. It feels like a scam, it's indistinguishable.<p>There is also a potential for a scam. If I somehow filled in a slightly wrong email address someone else could, in theory, have taken over my account, and could have redirected the shipment. The point is, I'll never know, and I was not made aware of such risk while signing up. Indeed the signup experience was strangely feed-forward, without an email-confirmation step. In the end it felt like I was supposed to dump \u20ac480 into a void, with nothing to show for, except a bank transfer. Just like in a scam I was forced to rely on the reputation of the brand, only. This could have been a scam, except this is standard policy.<p>I think the above is a relevant data-point to many of you (non-scammers), because it represents an extreme case, even beyond Google, one where not only the non-fallability of software artifacts is presumed, but also the non-fallability of the organizational process that led to its 100% no-contact design.<p>That's sure to have some relevance to the community, but of course I just want someone to talk to and solve what could have been the smallest of issues. Any advice on how to proceed next is appreciated.<p>Edit: as commenters have mentioned, there is a reset option, by email or phone. AFAIK neither works.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33681263\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33681263</a></p>\n<p>Points: 63</p>\n<p># Comments: 22</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://github.com/teaxyz/cli", "title": "Tea: A new package manager from the creator of brew", "date_published": "2022-11-20 14:39:56+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/teaxyz/cli\">https://github.com/teaxyz/cli</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33681216\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33681216</a></p>\n<p>Points: 34</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-team-among-top-political-donors-before-bankruptcy-11668949205", "title": "Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX Team Among Top Political Donors Before Bankruptcy", "date_published": "2022-11-20 14:35:44+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-team-among-top-political-donors-before-bankruptcy-11668949205\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-team-among-top-political-donors-before-bankruptcy-11668949205</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33681179\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33681179</a></p>\n<p>Points: 41</p>\n<p># Comments: 33</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-alexa-job-layoffs-rise-and-fall-2022-11", "title": "Amazon Is Gutting Its Voice-Assistant Alexa", "date_published": "2022-11-20 13:58:41+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-alexa-job-layoffs-rise-and-fall-2022-11\">https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-alexa-job-layoffs-rise-and-fall-2022-11</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33680904\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33680904</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://539kernel.com/", "title": "Kernel (OS Kernel Book)", "date_published": "2022-11-20 13:52:30+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://539kernel.com/\">https://539kernel.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33680869\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33680869</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://10kbclub.com/", "title": "10 KB Club: Curated list of websites whose home pages do not exceed 10 KB size", "date_published": "2022-11-20 13:49:30+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://10kbclub.com/\">https://10kbclub.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33680852\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33680852</a></p>\n<p>Points: 21</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33680805", "title": "Ask HN: Again: The \u201cI want to do everything but end up doing nothing\u201d dilemma", "date_published": "2022-11-20 13:44:23+00:00", "description": "<p>This thread is from 2015\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9049208<p>I have bookmarked it and read it sometimes.
