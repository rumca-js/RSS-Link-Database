<p>For many in Ukraine, this is a war of ‘decolonisation’  – and that includes Russia’s celebrated artistic heritage</p><p>At the <a href="https://opera.com.ua/en">National Opera of Ukraine</a> in Kyiv recently, I watched a performance of an opera by the Ukrainian composer Mykola Lysenko. The work, charming and comic and an escape from the grimness of Russian missile attacks, is called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/21/bravo-reopened-kyiv-opera-drowns-out-russian-artillery">Natalka Poltavka</a>, based on a play by Ivan Kotliarevsky, who pioneered Ukrainian-language literature in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. Operas by Verdi, Puccini and Mozart, and ballets such as Giselle and La Sylphide, are on the playbill, despite the almost daily air raid sirens. But there is no Eugene Onegin in sight, nor a Queen of Spades, and not a whisper of those Tchaikovsky staples of ballet, Sleeping Beauty or Swan Lake. Russian literature and music, Russian culture of all kinds, is off the menu in wartime Ukraine. It is almost a shock to return to the UK and hear Russian music blithely played on Radio 3.</p><p>This absence, some would say erasure, can be hard to comprehend outside Ukraine. When a symphony orchestra in Cardiff <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/09/cardiff-philharmonic-orchestra-removes-tchaikovsky-over-ukraine-conflict">removed the 1812 Overture</a> from a programme this spring, there was bafflement verging on an outcry: excising Tchaikovsky was allowing Vladimir Putin and his chums the satisfaction of “owning” Russian culture – it was censorship, it was playing into Russia’s hands. Tchaikovsky himself was not only long dead, but had been an outsider and an internationalist – so the various arguments went. It took some careful explanation to convey that a piece of music glorifying Russian military achievements, and involving actual cannons, might be somewhere beyond poor taste when Russia was at that moment shelling Ukrainian cities – particularly when the families of orchestra members were directly affected.</p><p>Charlotte Higgins is the Guardian’s chief culture writer<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/07/kyiv-ukrainians-culture-war-russian-decolonisation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The dramatic vanishing of polar ice sheets will cause catastrophic sea level rise that will threaten cities, according to a major new study</p><p>The climate crisis has pushed the planet’s stores of ice to a widespread collapse that was “unthinkable just a decade ago”, with Arctic sea ice certain to vanish in summers and ruinous sea level rise from melting glaciers now already in motion, a major new report has warned.</p><p>Even if planet-heating emissions are radically cut, the world’s vast ice sheets at the poles will continue to melt away for hundreds of years, causing up to three metres of sea level rise that will imperil coastal cities, the report states.

<p>For years the world saw Putin as almost a figure of fun – while in Russia he was already meting out brutality to dissidents and LGBTQ+ activists<br /></p><p>Last night I saw Pussy Riot, on the Hackney leg of their Riot Days European tour to raise money for a children’s hospital in Ukraine. Their sound guy, Alexander Cheparkhun, came on stage to introduce them. I guess he was about my age, I couldn’t be precise because I didn’t have my glasses. He vibed the sort of age, where you can’t see things without glasses. He described how he met Maria Alyokhina (who also goes by Masha Alekhina), one of the founding members of the band who was first imprisoned in 2012 and then under constant surveillance, harassment, house arrest, arrest-arrest and persecution, until she escaped from Russia to Iceland earlier this year. When her sentence was handed down 10 years ago, he said, it was the first time in his life he had witnessed the political imprisonment of artists.</p><p>This was a useful bit of context, or rather, a glass of cold water to the face, after years of somnambulance: no one is laughing at Vladimir Putin now, of course, but for years, he was almost a figure of fun, with his bare-chested, horse-riding photoshoots and florid turn of phrase. On the world stage, he was the uncle who might say dodgy things, but got invited anyway: what was the worst that could happen? This indulgent, pretty feckless view of Putin was overlaid by the sense that Russia merely did things differently; perhaps the state was a bit thin-skinned and hotheaded, maybe it didn’t prioritise human rights as much as one would like, but this was a cultural thing, probably related to the weather. If we had maybe expressed that view out loud more often, Russian citizens could have said: “No, actually, punk bands sentenced to hard labour for protest actions is very much a now thing, rather than an always thing.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/07/i-saw-the-magnificent-pussy-riot-last-night-if-only-the-world-had-listened-to-what-they-were-saying-a-decade-ago">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With four sendings-off, a comical own goal and a belting late equaliser from Nemanja Gudelj, the game lived up to its billing</p><p>“Well, this <em>is</em> a derby,” Real Betis’s Edgar González was saying, but it was hard not to be drawn to the pitch behind him where opponent Nemanja Gudelj was pacing about shaking his head. At the final whistle, the Sevilla defender had covered his face with his hands and just stood doubled over, <a href="https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1589581757409525765?s=20&amp;t=r62SA4IWfaIaooqRz9JvZg">elbows on knees</a>. Ivan Rakitic approached and they went through it once more, although it was a wonder they could hear anything. Next was Jesús Navas, the pair picking over the moment a vital victory slipped away. Now, waiting near the touchline for his turn to talk, they were going to ask Gudelj to relive it all over again on camera. He bit his lip, smiled and said: “I’m a bit angry with myself. I should have hit it better.”</p><p>Better?! The 138th Seville derby had finished 1-1, and Gudelj, son of a footballer and a basketball player, brother of a footballer and a tennis player, had scored the equaliser that earned Sevilla a precious point which pulled them out of the relegation zone. He had done so with an outrageous shot from somewhere over the other side of the Triana Bridge. “<em>Buenisimo</em>,” said the man he beat. It was only his second goal for Sevilla – his first had been an equally absurd effort from the same place that secured victory in Mallorca just three weeks earlier – and it could <em>not </em>have been hit better, the scoreboard behind the net flashing up <em>golazos</em> with impeccable and accidental timing as it tore 32 yards through the air.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/07/red-cards-a-rocket-and-a-ruckus-seville-derby-ends-in-glorious-chaos">Continue reading...</a>

They are young, sneakered, tieless image-makers, and fiercely loyal to him. They are products of today’s Westminster, a monastic enclosure of special advisers, thinktanks and lobby groups isolated from the world outside.

## Gavin Williamson has Sunak’s ‘full confidence’, says No 10, as Starmer calls for him to be sacked – UK politics live

<p>Prime minister’s judgment called into question after making Williamson minister again</p><p><strong>Keir Starmer</strong> has said Gavin Williamson should be sacked, because he is “not fit” be a government minister.</p><p>But, speaking to journalists this morning, the Labour leader focused his criticism on Rishi Sunak for giving Williamson a job as a minister without portfolio in the Cabinet Office, with the right to attend cabinet.</p><p>It is so disappointing that yet again we’re having a discussion about the prime minister’s judgment, this time in relation to Gavin Williamson. He’s clearly got people around the cabinet table who are not fit to be there. That is because he was so weak and wanted to avoid an election within his own party and I think the only way out of this, because these debates are going to go on, because of the weak position the prime minister is in, I think we should say to the public, they should have a choice - do you want to carry on with this chaos or do you want the stability of a Labour government? That’s why I think there is such a powerful case for a general election.</p><p>I think that the prime minister has got people who are clearly not fit for the job around the cabinet table. Gavin Williamson has got history when it comes to breaches of security and leaking, etc. He is clearly not suitable, but the central focus really here is on the prime minister, to ask the question why has he put these people around the cabinet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/nov/07/rishi-sunak-gavin-williamson-texts-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An unhappy couple settle their rivalry over on a series of inane challenges in a film that mistakes dodgy acting for ambience</p><p>This LA-set breakup comedy at least has a nifty hook: when a longstanding couple part ways, who gets drinking rights at their favourite bar? After five years together, flannel-shirted carpenter Allen (Luka Jones) and go-getting talent agent Nina (Melissa Fumero) are undergoing what Los Angelenos now call a “conscious uncoupling”. Having never fought when they were together, their separation proceeds on the same smooth lines – until they set foot in the Martinez Bar &amp; Lounge on the same evening, both on the town as singletons for the first time. Staff allegiances are divided, so they come up with a decider: Allen and Nina have to undergo a best-of-three bar challenge, with the loser “eighty-sixed” for good.</p><p>Debut director Jim Mahoney gets a tasty buzz on in the early stages, couching Bar Fight! as an upbeat Californian Christmas affair in the Shane Black tradition, with a rhythmical snap in his stride as the characters face off in front of the counter. He tries to make the Martinez a Cheers-style home-from-home, with boozy dramatis personae including soft-touch manager Dick (Vik Sahay), silver-tongued barman Mason (Daniel Dorr), and 1,000-yard-stare cook Elena (Dot Marie-Jones).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/07/bar-fight-review-breakup-comedy-turns-into-drinking-challenge-face-off">Continue reading...</a>

The longer, more ambitious of the two was The Waking of Angantyr, using verses from the story of a warrior woman who travels to the island where her dead father has been buried. It involves three protagonists, all of them sung by the countertenor in Hunt’s setting; the live electronics certainly conjured an evocative background of whispering voices, mysterious rustlings and knockings, but the vocal writing and its ensemble commentary hardly hinted at any drama, despite Purefoy’s best efforts with the text.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/07/bcmg-downie-dear-review-cbso-centre-birmingham">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Happiness might seem like a noble goal – but striving for it can be counterproductive</p><p>WHO DOESN’T WANT to be happy? At the end of the day, you might think, it’s happiness that matters most – it’s the reason for everything we do. This idea goes back to classical antiquity. According to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, whatever we pursue in life – “honour, pleasure, reason, and every virtue” – we choose “for the sake of happiness” since happiness “is the end of action”. Around this all-consuming aim we’ve built a multibillion-dollar industry: self-help.</p><p>Not that there haven’t been critics. “Humanity does <em>not</em> strive for happiness,” the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche quipped, “only the English do.” He was making fun of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/15/happiness-index-philosophy" title="">utilitarians like Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill,</a> for whom the point of morality is to achieve the greatest happiness for all. The irony is that Mill, too, had doubts about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jan/10/why-its-time-to-stop-pursuing-happiness" title="">pursuit of happiness</a>. As he saw, the craze for contentment threatens to subvert itself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/07/the-big-idea-why-we-shouldnt-try-to-be-happy">Continue reading...</a>

But the musicians whose songs are being used have no say in</p><p>There can be no tougher DJ gig than the Conservative party conference. It is not that it’s a discerning crowd. But it’s once the politicians have left the stage that the complaints start. This year Liz Truss herself was said to have selected M People’s Moving On Up to soundtrack her arrival at the lectern: it’s a determinedly upbeat anthem, if you don’t listen to the lyrics about packing your bags and moving on out. But the outgoing PM’s choice was not endorsed by M People, with founder Mike Pickering – a longtime anti-Tory – tweeting his anger.</p><p>Not that the band could do anything about it: the choice of music at such events is down to the discretion of the venue, not the label or artist (though it’s a different story for party political broadcasts).

Miedema has been granted a leave of absence to “rest and recharge” before the international break but when she returns she has the task of unseating the in-form Maanum, or reclaiming her place up top ahead of Stina Blackstenius.

<p>Until now, I’d hung on to an irrational childhood fear of the exploding pressure cooker, but I’ve recently rediscovered just how fast and efficient they are</p><p>This column ends well, with an ideal pan of beans, cooked in a third of the usual time, using less than a third of the usual energy. This column began decades ago, when I decided I was afraid of pressure cookers. Raking back though unreliable memories, it isn’t clear why, exactly, I was afraid. We didn’t have one at home, and relatives who did weren’t using them any more by the time we were growing up. There was no incident in the house next door, no scaremongering public-information film that had lodged itself in my mind. Unexplained fear became a quiet hang-up to which I clung even as pressure cookers evolved dramatically. Some of the best cooks I know told me to get over it.</p><p>Actually, this column began with a French physicist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Papin">Denis Papin</a>. Born near Blois in 1647, he studied medicine before moving to Paris, where he assisted the Dutch physicist Christian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-197023,00.html">Huygens</a> in building vacuum pumps. Later, in England, Papin worked with the physicist <a href="https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/robert-boyle">Robert Boyle</a> – whose pressure and volume of gas theory is known as Boyle’s Law – and built air pumps for the Royal Society of London. Papin’s research explored the relationship between boiling temperature and the surrounding pressure. When you cook in an ordinary pot at atmospheric pressure, water boils at 100C until it escapes as steam. Inside a sealed vessel, however, the trapped steam molecules move faster, increasing the surrounding pressure, which means the water boils at 121C. In 1679, Papin demonstrated a sensational invention: a closed vessel with a tight-fitting lid in which steam under pressure was used to cook food and soften bones; his “digesting engine”. One featurewas a small, weighted piston that moved up and released steam; a pressure-relief valve – and the original model for all modern pressure-cookers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/nov/07/how-rachel-roddy-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-pressure-cooker">Continue reading...</a>

## The Box review – Mexican teen’s search for missing father attains tragic status

<p>Hatzín Navarrete makes an impressive debut as a boy searching for the truth about his parent in a hostile world</p><p>Hatzín is an adolescent kid from Mexico City, first met arriving in northern Mexico near the US border. Played by Hatzín Navarrete – at the time of casting a non-professional actor – he’s there to collect the remains of his father, a man he barely knew, who was seemingly killed in an industrial accident. Offered a box and an identification card with a barely discernible photo of the dead man, Hatzín sets off on the long journey back, but changes his mind and jumps off the bus when he sees a man who looks like the picture on the ID card. Hatzín is convinced with possibly irrational fervour – the film never makes it quite clear if he’s deluded or not – that this is actually his father, who is now only pretending to be someone named Mario. Mario keeps trying to brush the kid off, gently at first and then with more force when he just keeps coming back.</p><p>Like Jacob in the Old Testament who insisted on wrestling with an angel until he blessed him, Hatzín wins the struggle eventually but pays a price for it. Mario (Hernán Mendoza) takes the boy in under his wing and puts him to work in his sleazy business recruiting people to work under brutal conditions in the local garment factories. There’s a very telling moment that says a lot about postcolonial capitalism when Mario rallies potential recruits by saying that their real enemy is the Chinese; they, he argues, will put their own children to work, taking advantage of their tiny hands, leaving Mexicans and Latin Americans like themselves in poverty unless they compete.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/07/the-box-review-mexican-teens-search-for-missing-father-attains-tragic-status">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Youssoufa Moukoko has broken into BVB’s first team and clamour is growing for Hansi Flick to take him to Qatar</p><p>Time is ticking away and the World Cup is looming large. Not exactly the moment, you might think, for Germany or any of the other qualified sides to call up a debutant. This one, however, is different – young he may be, but callow he isn’t, and he is arriving at the forefront of Hansi Flick’s mind at the perfect moment. Like most of the runs he makes in the yellow of Borussia Dortmund as autumn turns to winter, it appears as if Youssoufa Moukoko has timed this just right.</p><p>There are many remarkable things about the 17-year-old striker, not least that he has had to be patient to arrive at this point at which he is one of the first names on Edin Terzic’s team sheet.

## I hated being told I should ‘cherish every moment’ of motherhood – now I understand | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett

<p>Raising a baby is a huge challenge. No wonder many new parents resent the cult of compulsory joy</p><p>Of all the phrases parents tell me they dislike, “cherish every moment” is the winner. Time is a strange thing when you are caring for small humans, and, as I thought about it this week, it is this phrase that keeps coming back to me. It’s the idea that by feeling any negative emotion, you are somehow squandering time. I have been told by parents with postnatal mental health issues that this unrealistic phrase – often said by older people – has made them feel deep shame. Time is precious, and to not feel constantly delighted by your child is a terrible waste.<br /><br />I don’t feel shame, but I’ll confess that the occasional suggestion that this column is overly negative has wounded me. I’ve been writing it in real time these past eight months – I wrote notes for my first column while in hospital, the sounds of women in labour all around me – and though there have been struggles, there have also been immense, intense highs. My son still feels miraculous to me. But writing as it happens means real, living feelings land on the page, some dark, some light. There’s no time to try to temper reality in retrospect to make it seem like it’s always plain sailing.<br /><br />When I see new parents out and about with newborns, I feel solidarity but also a strange mix of other emotions. He was once so small and curled like a bug – how could that time have passed so quickly? Why did I not realise how short those days would be? At the time they felt unceasing; in the whirl of feed, sleep, feed, sleep I could not see an end to them. The baby and I were still one, and would cease to be. He would open his eyes to the world and look beyond me, and I would be gifted a whole new phase, while mourning that which came before. At the time, the shock of his premature<strong> </strong>arrival left little room for reflection – but had you asked me, I’d have maybe said that I felt that the time in the third trimester, when the baby should have still been safe inside me, had been lost, or even stolen. Now I say I got five extra weeks of him. What a gift, this time travel.<br /><br />When you are raising a child, it isn’t that the hard parts aren’t hard, but that time marches on so indefatigably that they almost mystically fade. Older people, I think, understand this, which is why they often can’t remember when you ask them about specific aspects of parenting, such as my mum not recalling when she moved on from giving me purees, or how they coped with certain difficulties. (In case it sounds as though her memory is going, she just recited TS Eliot to the baby: “I have measured out my life with coffee spoons.” I could measure the last year of mine in formula scoops, I thought.)</p><p>Women have said to me that they suspect this amnesia might be evolutionary, otherwise no one would have a second child. Time makes you sentimental, and pain fades in the memory, with sleeplessness rendering whole stages – where the passing of time felt like treacle – a blur. I’m starting to understand that. The hell of establishing breastfeeding felt, at the time, all consuming. I doubt I’ll ever fully forget it, but thinking about it now is like watching a film about someone else, while sitting a great distance from the screen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/07/cherish-moment-motherhood-baby-new-parents">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The illustrious ballet dancer on natural insecurity, his defection from the USSR to Canada – and how his body feels these days</p><p><em>Mikhail Baryshnikov</em><em>, </em><em>74</em><em>, is the finest ballet dancer of his generation. </em><em>Born in Riga, Latvia, to Russian parents</em><em>, he danced with the </em><em>Kirov Ballet</em><em> before defecting to </em><em>Canada in 1974</em><em>. A dancer of short stature but huge hunger, versatility, technical mastery and personality, Baryshnikov made his career in the US, performing with </em><em>New York City Ballet</em><em> and </em><em>American Ballet Theatre</em><em>, where he later became </em><em>artistic director</em><em>. He moved into contemporary dance, founding the </em><em>White Oak Dance Project with Mark Morris</em><em>, and now runs the </em><em>Baryshnikov Arts Center in New York</em><em>. He still performs in experimental theatre, most recently a version of </em><em>Chekhov</em><em>’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/theater/review-the-orchard-arlekin-baryshnikov.html">The Cherry Orchard</a> by </em><em>Ukrainian director Igor Golyak</em><em>, where he shared the stage with a giant robotic arm. On screen, he has appeared in films </em><em>The Turning Point</em><em> and </em><em>White Nights</em><em>, and in </em><em>Sex and the City</em><em>. On </em><em>16 November</em><em>, Baryshnikov will be awarded the </em><em>Royal Academy of Dance’s Queen Elizabeth II Coronation</em><em> award at Buckingham Palace.</em> <br /><br /><strong>Congratulations on receiving the RAD’s QEII </strong><strong>award, presented for ‘outstanding services to the art of dance and ballet’. What has ballet given you, and what do you think you have been able to give ballet?<br /></strong>Ballet gave me my life. From the age of eight or nine, my first experiences in ballet gave me the confidence to believe I could be a part of the mysterious world of the theatre. And I mean everyone from the performers to the electricians to the cleaners that come in after a show. I’ve had a love affair with it all and still do. As for what I’ve given to ballet, I gave my excitement, I think. And gratitude for the opportunity to live and work in a unique and sometimes strange world.<br /><br /><strong>How often do you dance now? I saw a video of you busting out some moves at a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CibXzEzg5J9/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=embed_video_watch_again">Vogue parade</a> recently – you’ve still got it!<br /></strong>You’re very kind, thank you. I don’t dance much now, and was flattered when Anna Wintour asked me to be a part of the Vogue event. It was a kiss to New York and its crazy resilience.<br /><br /><strong>How is your body feeling these days?<br /></strong>Every day is a new encounter, and they are not always pleasant.</p><p><strong>You’ve danced so many different choreographers and styles across classical and contemporary, and you’re still performing in theatre now. What drives that hunger?<br /></strong>I like to put myself in vulnerable positions artistically. It’s exhilarating to try and overcome the natural insecurity and fear that comes with each new project. Chasing that unknown and finding a way to make it work keeps me focused.

<p>An impressive documentary reveals the radical significance of carnival celebrations in the making of a nation with a dark, difficult past</p><p>Exuberant and historically rich, Leah Gordon and Eddie Hutton Mills’s engrossing documentary charts centuries of Haitian history through the lens of carnival celebrations. The country has witnessed unspeakable atrocities but carnival serves not only as a reminder of the past, but also as a radical act of oral storytelling and collective solidarity in the face of oppression.</p><p>Shot in the port town of Jacmel, Kanaval highlights the overt political consciousness of the region’s carnival troupes. From the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the revolutions against French colonial rule, and the dictatorship of François Duvalier, historical events are translated into costumes, ranging from the colourful papier-mache of animal heads to everyday materials such as cow’s teeth or dried wheat. The integration of these important chapters of Haitian nationhood into carnival performances shows how folk tradition can function as a form of popular dissent. Against dominant Eurocentric narratives, carnival is also an avenue into which local people can insert their own voices.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/07/kanaval-a-peoples-history-of-haiti-in-six-chapters-review-spirited-and-striking">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin has spent his career talking to scientists. Now they’re telling him they’re scared of what they’re seeing</p><p>Back in the 1980s, when climate research began to really take off, scientists were desperate to retain their credibility as they unravelled the potentially dire consequences of the “new” phenomenon of global warming. Most journalists tiptoed round this topic because no one wanted to lose their reputation by scaremongering. But as the science steadily became overwhelming researchers pushed their conclusions in the face of policymakers. </p><p>More and more scientists are now admitting publicly that they are scared by the recent climate extremes, such as the floods in Pakistan and west Africa, the droughts and heatwaves in Europe and east Africa, and the rampant ice melt at the poles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/07/why-scientists-are-using-the-word-scary-over-the-climate-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Saka’s class is too much for Chelsea, Leicester put Lampard’s Toffees to shame and Leeds unearth a future star</p><p>Officially, Bukayo Saka is the 33rd most fouled player in the Premier League. Unofficially, Arsenal fans will tell you that their man is the victim of some sinister conspiracy between opposition left-backs and referees to get him hacked out of the game. So, a valid concern or the usual tribal tinfoil nonsense? It’s actually more complex than it looks. What sets Saka apart is his unique close dribbling style, the ball almost wedged between his feet as he runs. So when he buys the contact – because all wingers buy contact – the tackle often takes ball and man together, making it hard to see which impact came first. Simply put, referees need to do better here. But it also needs a recognition from Arsenal fans that Saka isn’t being deliberately victimised or singled out: he’s just really, unusually good. <strong>Jonathan Liew</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/06/chelsea-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Chelsea 0-1 Arsenal</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/06/aston-villa-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">Aston Villa 3-1 Manchester United</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/06/tottenham-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">Tottenham 1-2 Liverpool</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/06/southampton-newcastle-premier-league-match-report">Southampton 1-4 Newcastle</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/05/leeds-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report">Leeds 4-3 Bournemouth</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/05/manchester-city-fulham-premier-league-match-report">Manchester City 2-1 Fulham</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/05/wolves-brighton-premier-league-match-report">Wolves 2-3 Brighton</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/06/west-ham-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report">West Ham 1-2 Crystal Palace</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/07/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

Literally. After living in Beirut for a year as one of the country’s 80,000 Sri Lankan migrant workers, a fellow countryman he met in a supermarket invited him to a game. “I had been looking for somewhere to play,” says Sugath. “Also, I didn’t have any friends.” He turned up at the address he was given to discover the players crammed into a tiny underground car park beneath an apartment building.</p><p>Sugath is a man used to improvising. “As kids we didn’t need a big playing area or good equipment to play,” he says. “We used plastic balls, the old base of a coconut leaf for a bat.” Within 10 years, he had founded Nomads CC, who played in another, open-air car park behind a Jesuit church. Sugath was the captain, star batter and organiser extraordinaire.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/07/how-car-park-cricket-in-lebanon-gives-sri-lankan-migrant-workers-an-escape">Continue reading...</a>

But his book is chiefly about the titular “Big Terrible Thing”: Perry’s alcoholism and painkiller/opioid addiction (OxyContin, Vicodin, Dilaudid, to name a few) that led to him spending more than half his life in rehab and treatment centres, detoxing more than 65 times, and paying upwards of $9m trying to get sober.</p><p>Famous by his mid-20s, Perry’s compulsions led to him suffering pancreatitis by 30. In 2018, aged 49, his colon exploded, which is where his memoir begins: a vivid near-death hellscape (counsellors try to stop him going to hospital, thinking it’s “drug-seeking behaviour”) involving seven-hour surgery (with a 2% chance of survival), a coma, huge scars and nine months with a colostomy bag that keeps bursting, covering him with faeces. (It’s the threat of a permanent colostomy bag that frightens Perry into quitting.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/07/friends-lovers-and-the-big-terrible-thing-by-matthew-perry-addiction">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In her 50s, Zeenat Fayyaz lost three years of her life to a breakdown. Her recovery began with electroconvulsive therapy – and continues with the classes she runs at a community cafe<br /><br /></p><p>Many of us would agree that laughter and good food make life worth living, and Zeenat Fayyaz combines both. She runs a five-week cookery course at a community cafe near her home in south London and each lesson begins with five minutes of laughter yoga. She demonstrates one exercise – exaggerated movements where she pretends to make and then drink a milkshake that finishes with a great “Ha ha ha”. “The concept behind it is your brain can’t differentiate between real and fake laughter, so you get the same health benefits,” she says. Besides, it’s so silly that real laughter follows. “It connects people; it’s an icebreaker.”</p><p>Fayyaz, 62, says she wanted “to do something for myself, something I can call my own. I’ve been cooking all my life and so I’ve turned my life experience into something I can support myself financially with.” It feels like “a miracle”.</p><p>In the UK and Ireland, <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.org">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.ie">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

<p>The Imitation of Life star was pigeonholed and undervalued by Hollywood but years later, she is finally receiving the recognition she deserves</p><p>“I went through a hell of a lot, you know? Being black and all. And beautiful!” Interviewed on the TV at the age of 92, Juanita Moore may have been laughing but she was telling a painful truth about her career in Hollywood. Despite being Oscar-nominated for a truly great performance in one of Hollywood’s most powerful melodramas, her career was a struggle: for recognition, for roles worthy of her talents, and her own fight for better opportunities for her Black peers in the entertainment industry.</p><p>A new documentary, which premiered this weekend in Los Angeles and will be screening until 10 November, tells the life story of this remarkable actor. It also tells the story of racism in 20th-century Hollywood: as seen through the eyes of a woman of remarkable talent and integrity. It’s a fairly low-key film, but it contains some compelling footage, not least Moore telling truth to power on a news bulletin, but also interviews with recently departed stars Sidney Poitier and Louise Fletcher, and clips from the full length of Moore’s long career. She was born in 1914 and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/02/juanita-moore-imitation-of-life-dies">died aged 99, on New Year’s Eve 2013</a>. She started out in showbiz as a chorus girl in the Cotton Club in the 1930s, became a member of the Screen Actors’ Guild in 1937 and was working right up until 2001. She appeared in more than 70 films, but most of her performances went uncredited. Her greatest success came in 1959, when she was nominated for an Oscar for her astonishing performance in one of the greatest American films, Imitation of Life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/07/juanita-moore-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Brexit is exposed, the economy is in shreds, the party has imploded – and the government is running out of people to blame</p><p>Britain exists in an imaginary state of crisis about immigration. Nothing soothes this anxiety – not facts, not real numbers of arrivals, not the distinction between migrants in general and asylum seekers in particular.

The government is keen to stress the recent increase in Channel crossings, yet asylum applications are <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn01403/#:~:text=The%20annual%20number%20of%20asylum,highest%20annual%20number%20since%202003.">half</a> what they were 20 years ago. The real and only cause of the debacle at Manston and other failing centres is this: the number of asylum applications processed within six months has <a href="https://freemovement.org.uk/briefing-the-sorry-state-of-the-uk-asylum-system/">fallen</a> from almost 90% to about 4%. It’s not that more people are arriving than ever before, it’s that more of them aren’t being processed, and so are stuck in the asylum system for years. Efficiency has been dropping sharply since 2014, one year after Theresa May established the “hostile environment” and in the middle of George Osborne’s austerity programme. The intersection of those two forces created an underfunded, cruel Home Office, and with it Britain’s immigration “crisis”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/07/tories-myth-migrant-crisis-brexit-immigration-centre">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The bass player publishes his third book this month, reflecting on life in one of the 80s biggest bands. He talks about recovering from two brain tumours, acting and why he would like to apologise to Tony Hadley</p><p>After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martinkemp" title="">Martin Kemp</a> had two brain tumours removed, people kept teasing him. “A few of my friends said: ‘I don’t know what they’ve done but they’ve put something in, instead of taking something out. They’ve put intelligence in, Mart.’” He is laughing. “Making light of it,” he says. “But all I mean is: we all learn at different parts of our lives.” Kemp turned 61 last month, and is very much still learning and creating.

<p><strong>Plastic in the depths</strong>: as ‘ghost gear’ chokes the ocean, campaigners call for mandatory measures including buy-back schemes and recycling </p><p>A trip to the remote north Pacific gyre provides a stark reality check on the scale of the planet’s plastic waste crisis. “You’ve been sailing at 10 knots for five days, you’re alone. You don’t see any other boats. And then you find toothbrushes and lighters floating around you,” says Laurent Lebreton, head of research at <a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/">the Ocean Cleanup</a>, a Dutch non-profit organisation that develops technology to extract marine plastics. “It’s just very surreal.”</p><p>What he finds most striking, however, are the metres of netting, ropes and line, luminous orange buoys, crab pots and fish traps: remnants of the global fishing industry, drifting around in what is known as the “great Pacific garbage patch”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/07/invisible-killer-ghost-fishing-gear-deadliest-marine-plastic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor gives an astonishing performance in this movie about a miracle ‘fasting girl’ in rural Ireland. Shame she’ll have to wait two years to see it. We talk to the teen talent and her co-star mother</p><p>Thirteen-year-old Kíla Lord Cassidy is perched on a sofa. It’s a few hours until the UK premiere of an extraordinary film, The Wonder, in which she co-stars with Florence Pugh. Dressed up for the red carpet, Kíla is pretty as a picture in a pink lace dress smothered with embroidered flowers, her long hair blow-dried into waves and sparkly glitter ballet shoes on her feet. The trouble for the 13-year-old is that she’s too young to legally watch her own film. “It’s a 15,” she says, grinning ear to ear. “I’m not allowed.” The plan is to slope off with her dad and little brother after the red carpet, as the rest of the cast walk into the cinema.</p><p>On the sofa beside Kíla is her mum, the Irish actor Elaine Cassidy, beaming, proud as anything. She will be part of that group heading into the premiere because, in an inspired piece of casting by the film’s Chilean director Sebastián Lelio, she plays Kíla’s mother. It’s a small role, but one she couldn’t resist. “To be around that kind of talent, I’d have swept the set. Because my soul has been fed. You know?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/07/kila-lord-cassidy-elaine-wonder-film-rural-ireland">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A spate of bank robberies has hit Beirut in recent weeks but they are heists with a twist: people are demanding – at gunpoint – that staff hand them their own money. Michael Safi reports</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, <strong>Michael Safi</strong> went to meet a bank robber. She was about 5ft tall, in her late 20s, and wearing fluffy slippers. Her name is<strong> Sali Hafez. </strong>At the end of her tether, she took a plastic replica gun and a bottle of petrol and walked into a branch of her bank to demand they gave her the money in her account. She says the balance was over $100,000. They gave her $14,000.</p><p>Today we bring you the story of a bank robbery, but not that one. Instead, it is a story of how Lebanon’s banks became so dysfunctional that they had to prevent customers withdrawing their own money. The Reuters journalist <strong>Timour Azhari </strong>explains how the country’s entire banking system imploded after running what the World Bank has called a giant Ponzi scheme. For years, Lebanon encouraged foreign investment with the promise of high interest rates, but the war in neighbouring Syria and then the pandemic meant that when investors took fright, the whole financial system came tumbling down. And when that happened, it exposed to sunlight what had been happening all along: a carnival of plundering of the state’s assets by a ruling elite that has yet to confront the mess the country is in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/nov/07/who-is-robbing-lebanons-banks-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New Zealand PM tells party conference ‘we are not done yet’ as poll shows Labour’s support at 5-year low ahead of elections in 2023</p><p>In the darkened amphitheatre of a south Auckland conference centre, a youth choir swayed, as crowds waited for the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, to take the stage. “Give me one more chance,” they sang, in a medley featuring the Jackson 5’s I Want You Back. “Won’t you please let me back in your heart.”</p><p>It was an apt-enough score for the annual Labour conference, with the party facing a steep uphill road to persuade New Zealanders to return them to office for another three years. “We are not done yet,” Ardern told the party faithful, as delegates sought to map a pathway to election victory in an increasingly sour economic and political landscape. Three days of speeches and discussions built a picture of a party girding itself for a bitterly fought campaign: speeches were laced with jabs at centre-right opposition leader Christopher Luxon, warnings of the prospect of gains rolled back under a National government, and encouragement to stay the course under fire.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/07/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-labour-party-conference-2023-election">Continue reading...</a>

Russia “is concentrating forces and means for a possible repetition of massive attacks on our infrastructure, primarily energy”, said Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. Ukraine faced a 32% deficit in projected power supply on Monday, said Sergei Kovalenko, CEO of Yasno, a major supplier of energy to the capital. “This is a lot, and it’s force majeure,” he said. About 500 power generators were being sent to Ukraine by 17 EU countries as 4.5m Ukrainians were left without power.</p><p><strong>Kyiv’s mayor urged residents to prepare for a worst-case scenario by making emergency plans to leave the city and stay with friends or family.</strong> Vitali Klitschko urged residents to “consider everything” including loss of power and water. “If you have extended family or friends outside Kyiv, where there is autonomous water supply, an oven, heating, please keep in mind the possibility of staying there for a certain amount of time.”</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s Russian-occupied city of Kherson was cut off from water and electricity supplies on Sunday</strong> after an airstrike and damage to the Kakhovka dam, local officials said. “In Kherson and a number of other areas in the region, there is temporarily no electricity or water supply,” the city’s Moscow-installed administration said on Telegram. Russia accused Ukraine of an act of “sabotage”.</p><p><strong>Residents of Kherson were urged to evacuate as soon as possible after receiving warning messages on their phones</strong>, Ukraine’s military said on Sunday. Russia was “occupying and evacuating” Kherson simultaneously, trying to convince Ukrainians its force are leaving when in fact they are digging in, Nataliya Humenyuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern forces, told state television. The Kremlin-installed administration in Kherson already has expelled tens of thousands of civilians from the city.</p><p><strong>Russian forces are stepping up their<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-besieged-bakhmut-harder-and-harder-to-survive-in-says-official?page=with:block-6367a1fe8f084995473a93c7#block-6367a1fe8f084995473a93c7"> strikes in a fiercely contested region of eastern Ukraine</a></strong>, worsening the already tough conditions for residents and the Ukrainian army, Ukrainian authorities said. “Very fierce Russian attacks on Donetsk region are continuing.

<p>We are all waiting to see Hancock eat a kangaroo penis – but the failed health secretary hasn’t even turned up yet, leaving us with a bunch of people we’ve barely heard of</p><p>As former DJ Chris Moyles put it after parachuting into the jungle, “I’d rather eat a sheep’s anus than ever do anything like that again.” You’ve never been so relatable, Mr Moyles. I feel precisely the same way after watching nearly two hours of the first episode of the 21st series of I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here. While the members of Cop27 gathered in Egypt, the Not Much Cop 10 invaded Australia. “You might know me from Hollyoaks,” said one pretender to become king of the jungle. “More likely,” I told telly, “not.”</p><p>There was a huge problem with the first episode: insufficient schadenfreude. I have absolutely no interest in seeing three people I’ve scarcely heard of – newsreader Charlene White, Euros-winning footballer Jill Scott and comedian Babatunde Aleshe – dangle over the edge of a high-rise tower in Australia to win tokens for a meal in their camp. Do you really want to hurt me, sang Boy George, perhaps the most famous of the contestants in this year’s show, many years ago. Absolutely not, Mr George. There’s only one person I want to see suffer. I want to see disgraced lockdown rules-flouter and failed health secretary Matt Hancock being force-fed kangaroo penises for his temerity in suggesting that he’s getting out of the Westminster bubble and going to the jungle to get in touch with real people.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/07/im-a-celebrity-review-two-hours-of-sheer-matt-hancock-free-hell">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Analysis examining carbon impact of billionaires’ investments published as Cop27 talks get under way</p><p>The super-rich emit greenhouse gases at a level equivalent to the whole of France from their investments in carbon intensive businesses, according to analysis published on the opening of the Cop27 UN climate talks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/06/egypt-cop27-climate-surveillance-cybersecurity">in Egypt</a>.</p><p>Examining the carbon impact of the investments of 125 billionaires, the research found they had a collective $2.4tn stake in 183 companies. On average each billionaire’s investment emissions produced 3m tonnes of CO2 a year; a million times more than the average emissions of 2.76 tonnes of CO2 for those living in the bottom 90% of earners. In total the 125 members of the super-rich emitted 393m tonnes of CO2 a year – equivalent to the emissions of France, which has a population of 67 million.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/07/super-richs-carbon-investment-emissions-equivalent-to-whole-of-france">Continue reading...</a>
