<p>We spend a lot of time looking at <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3219792/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html">the best paid antivirus suites</a>, but we don&rsquo;t talk much about free antivirus solutions. Part of the reason is that the free versions are based on their paid counterparts.</p>



<p>If you see a paid version you like that offers a free alternative, you can safely assume the antivirus protection level is similar, save for any specific malware types the free version doesn&rsquo;t cover.</p>



<p>To create this list of the top free AV programs we looked at the top mainstream antivirus suites for Windows 10 and selected the ones that offer a free version, as not all of them do. After that, we looked at how well these suites performed in third-party detection tests. We also made sure they weren&rsquo;t resource hogs, because the last thing you want is a piece of free software slowing down your PC while running in the background.</p>



<p>In the end, our selection came down to these five antivirus suites. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/548703/avast-one-review-its-new-well-priced-and-looks-good.html">Avast One</a> is a very highly rated antivirus program. With <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8200811/type/dlg/sid/2-1-398720-1-0-0/https://www.avast.com/en-us/index2?utm_expid=.c0DtHM0TTPSHKitQTgaQDg.1&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avast.com%2Fen-us%2Fabout#pc" rel="nofollow">the free version</a> of this suite you can run all the various virus scans. Most of the key Avast protections are also available, such as scanning new files added to your system, watching for malicious behavior from installed programs, a web browsing shield, and an email shield.</p>

<p>Avast Free even allows you to inspect your network and see the devices currently connected to your home router.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Avast Free uses a so-called smart scan to look for a variety of problems including browser threats, outdated apps, viruses and malware, and &ldquo;Advanced issues&rdquo; such as whether your webcam is protected from hijacking and the status of your firewall. The trick with those advanced issues, however, is that to supposedly fix them you need to start paying for the Avast One suite, which costs about about $50 per year for new subscribers.</p>

<p>What you don&rsquo;t get for free is the phishing protection, the sandbox to separate suspicious files from your system, the Avast firewall, webcam shield, password protection, and a sensitive data shield. It does, however, provide basic ransomware protection.</p>

<p>Avast is surprisingly useful in its free version and is one of the most flexible options around. Yes, it can be a little annoying during installation&mdash;like trying to sneak a Google Chrome install on you, for instance&mdash;but that&rsquo;s the kind of minor annoyance free software often comes with.</p>

<p>Kaspersky is another highly rated antivirus with a good amount to offer in its free service. This <a href="https://usa.kaspersky.com/free-antivirus">free AV suite</a> doesn&rsquo;t try to install any extra software on the sly like Avast does. It will, however, ask you to create a Kaspersky account during installation and remind you to try a 30-day free trial of its premium services.</p>

<p>We had some issues installing Kaspersky with Microsoft&rsquo;s Edge browser in late May 2021. Defender&rsquo;s Smartscreen kicked in flagging Kaspersky Free as dangerous. It&rsquo;s not clear why this happened.</p>

<p>Kaspersky Free supports the various scanning options you&rsquo;d expect from paid suites, including full scans, scans of external devices, and the ability to schedule scans. Also part of the free package are Kaspersky&rsquo;s password manager and Secure Connection VPN with a 300MB data usage limit per day.</p>

<p>What you don&rsquo;t get are the privacy-protection features for preventing unauthorized use of your webcam; Safe Money, the sandboxed browser for financial transactions; PC Cleaner for clearing out old files; and any of the extra tools such as the software updater or network monitor. To see what you&rsquo;re missing check out our review of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3441185/kaspersky-security-cloud-2020-antivirus-review.html">Kaspersky Security Cloud</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, however, Kaspersky offers solid protection for free, plus a few extras.</p>

<h2 id="free-antivirus-vs-paid-av-what-do-you-sacrifice">Free antivirus vs. paid AV: What do you sacrifice?</h2>



<p>As you can see, there are several capable free AV programs for you to choose from. Still, we feel it&rsquo;s important to point out what you<em> don&rsquo;t</em> get when you opt for a free solution. Email protection, for example, is typically a paid feature&mdash;and something that people who are extremely active in a desktop email program might care about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same goes for phishing protection and other web threats. While some free antivirus suites offer minimal protection, the best protection against malware online comes from the paid versions of each suite. You can, however, minimize web threats with ad blockers and other security-minded browser add-ons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ransomware protection used to be exclusive to paid tiers, but these days many programs are offering some type of ransomware protection for free. It&rsquo;s usually not as extensive and detailed as in the paid suites, but it does exist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also missing from the free suites are enhanced security features such as a sandboxed area for opening suspicious files, a sandboxed browser for shopping protection, an enhanced firewall, monitoring for malicious behavior from installed programs, and webcam monitors.</p>



<p>If, however, you&rsquo;re only looking for basic antivirus protection that scans your PC and alerts you when there&rsquo;s a problem, then one of these suites will do the job without costing you a cent.&nbsp;</p>

## Buying a new PC power supply is complex now. Here’s what you need to know

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Power supplies are simple, right? Just figure out how much power draw all your computer parts use, get one with a few more watts, and call it a day. Wrong! In addition to creature comforts like standard versus modular rails, you need to think about compatible sizes, brand reliability, and power efficiency. And with the new ATX 3.0 spec and the 12VHPWR connector for the latest graphics cards, it just got more complicated. To make it simple again, let Gordon and Adam walk you through your options in the latest PCWorld YouTube video. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure><p>One of the things you <em>shouldn&rsquo;t </em>do is buy a power supply that&rsquo;s way more powerful than you actually need for your parts. Unless you know you&rsquo;re going to upgrade to a more power-hungry CPU or GPU fairly soon, powering up a huge PSU for a computer that doesn&rsquo;t need all that juice will just waste electricity. Go for something more practical to save money on your initial build and in the long run. </p>



<p>What about efficiency? In the context of PC power supply, efficiency is a rating by which the PSU converts alternating current (AC) from your home&rsquo;s power grid to the direct current (DC) electricity that your computer uses. An 80 percent efficient power supply will convert 80 percent of AC electricity to DC. Higher efficiency is, obviously, better. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394951/pc-power-supply-ratings-80-plus-platinum-vs-gold-vs-bronze-vs-white-explained.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">The 80 Plus industry standard</a> is a mark of efficiency &mdash; 80% is pretty much the bottom line &mdash; with the fancier 80 Plus tiers, Gold, Platinum, and Titanium, indicating higher efficiency at load, up to 94 percent. Note that a higher 80 Plus rating does NOT necessarily indicate quality or reliability, just measured efficiency. </p>



<p>Another way to measure the efficiency of a power supply is the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cybenetics.com/index.php?option=power-supplies&amp;xcust=2-2-1369361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cybenetics rating system</a>, which takes efficiency into account at much more variable levels. This is great if you&rsquo;re building a PC that will frequently be used for more mundane tasks like email and basic text-based web browsing because it&rsquo;s more indicative of the efficiency you&rsquo;ll see when the computer is using less than half of its full power capacity. </p>



<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re planning on building a PC with the latest Nvidia graphics cards, or one that&rsquo;s capable of upgrading to them at a later date, you might want to get <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/631851/atx-3-0-explained-why-intel-gave-power-supplies-their-first-overhaul-in-20-years.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">an ATX 3.0 supply with a 12VHPWR connector</a>. (It&rsquo;s also called 12-volt high power.) These connectors are capable of sending up to 600 watts on a single line (though not every power supply can push that much). It&rsquo;s possible to use older power supplies with the latest graphics cards, but you might need adapter cables that use multiple 6- or 8-pin cables. </p>



<p>What about brand names? While we recommend that you avoid the kind of no-name brand Adam shows off in the video, power supplies are generally reliable across name brands. (In fact, a lot of these brands are buying from the same general manufacturers.) If there&rsquo;s one that you&rsquo;re comfortable with and that you trust, go with it! But that being said, a longer and more comprehensive warranty is obviously better than a shorter one. </p>

<p>Accordingly, it&rsquo;s mostly made of plastic and only sports wired connectivity, but does share some of its premium sibling&rsquo;s better features, like fully swiveling earcups and a stretchy inner headband that floats atop your head. In the audio department, too, it hits all the right notes, delivering fantastic sound whatever media type you&rsquo;re listening to. Plus, its flashy RGB lighting is dazzling anytime of the day or night.</p>

<h3 id="steelseries-arctis-nova-3-design">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3: Design</h3>



<p>When it comes to comfort, the Arctis Nova 3 actually outdoes the Nova Pro Wireless. The upper adjustable headband feels super snug without a hint of clamp pressure, and the Nova 3&rsquo;s AirWeave earcups are some of the softest I&rsquo;ve used. They&rsquo;re covered in a light mesh fabric, which is cooler than the Nova Pro&rsquo;s ritzy, but sometimes stuffy, leatherette ones on hot days.</p>



<p>SteelSeries has done a great job making the Nova 3 super light and portable too. At 8.9 ounces (253 grams), it&rsquo;s a good deal lighter than the Nova Pro Wireless whose metal earcup covers, among other features, add on an additional 2.9 ounces. In fact, only the Asus ROG Strix Go Moonlight White comes up lighter in our field of reviews. That miniscule weight means you can wear it all day long and not even feel it.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1363238" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/arctis_nova_3_black_life_desk_primary-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>RGB lights programmable to 16.8 million colors light up the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3&rsquo;s earcups.&nbsp;</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">SteelSeries</p></div>



<p>Admittedly, some weight appears to be traded for a small size. I measured my review unit to be just 8 inches from top to bottom, and the cups were just 4 inches at their longest part. That&rsquo;s not ideal if you have a large head or ears&mdash;otherwise the device should fit square on.</p>



<p>As to styling, the Nova 3 is undoubtedly made to impress gamers&mdash;the middle of the outer earcups contain a soft scratch-proof material that prevents nicks and grazes, while simultaneously showing off SteelSeries&rsquo; iconic logos. Additionally, dazzling RGB lighting rings circle the outer cans. They&rsquo;re programmable with up to 16.8 million colors and a range of cool lighting effects via the SteelSeries GG software app.</p>



<p>Admittedly, these features aren&rsquo;t unique in budget headsets, but the Nova 3 does have a few small design touches that elevate it above rivals. Features like its fully retractable ClearCast Gen 2 noise-cancelling microphone and its detachable cords are two that come to mind. The former slides effortlessly back into the earcup, so that you never have to worry about losing your mic, while the latter prevents you having to buy a new set if you break your cords&mdash;so credit to SteelSeries for going the extra mile.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1363227" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mic-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3&rsquo;s noise-cancelling microphone fully retracts into its left earcup.&nbsp;</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>For connectivity, the Nova 3 sports just simple wired connectivity, but you still get excellent multiplatform access with three useful cords supplied in the box. That includes a USB-C to USB-C cable, 3.5mm analog cable and USB-C to USB-A adapter cable, which extends connectivity to the Xbox One and Xbox X/S.</p>



<p>Other than those devices, you can connect to pretty much everything else&mdash;including a PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, or an Android smartphone. Mind you, you will be tethered at a distance of between approximately 4 to 5 feet (depending on the cord you use), so be prepared to have to take your headset off if you need to wander about.</p>



<h3 id="steelseries-arctis-nova-3-audio-performance">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3: Audio performance</h3>



<p>SteelSeries has talked up the Nova 3&rsquo;s Acoustic System, which includes custom-made 40mm drivers, as being a big improvement on previous generations and while we didn&rsquo;t have any predecessors on hand to test out that claim, we&rsquo;re thinking it&rsquo;s likely to be true, judging by how good the Nova 3 sounded in games, music, and movies.</p>



<p>The Nova 3 is also a cinch to control, with just a volume wheel, mute microphone button, and simple switch to turn the RGB lighting on or off, so you won&rsquo;t need to worry about reading complicated instructions.</p>



<p>Playtesting a bunch of games from my Steam library revealed the headset&rsquo;s strength to be the upper bass and mid tones, which give it a warm and punchy audio profile. This really hits home in games like <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> and<em> Elden Ring</em>, which tend to champion audio in that part of the spectrum.</p>



<p>Regrettably, the Nova 3 lets in just about every ambient sound in your environment, having no Active Noise Cancellation to speak of, and only the slightest passive barrier to unwanted sound.</p>



<p>Still, this blip is partially made up for by a highly sensitive bidirectional microphone that relayed my voice with gusto in Discord chats. It&rsquo;s noise cancellation, which uses an AI algorithm to block ambient noise, was also very effective, keeping my recordings distortion-free at normal volume levels, and only picking up some slight disturbance when I pushed the mic volume to max.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1363251" height="702" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Microphone-settings.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Sonar in the SteelSeries GG app gives you a lot of control over your mic&rsquo;s settings.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>One of the highlights of using the Nova 3 was being able to personalize my sound settings to a ridiculous level&mdash;and I mean that in the most complimentary way. The Nova 3 utilizes the SteelSeries GG app on PC, which if not best-in-class, is at least equal to the very best that rivals have to offer. In the top-level of the app, I was delighted to see that I could apply up to four audio presets and change the Nova 3&rsquo;s RGB lighting colors and effects.</p>



<p>But the real hero is definitely Sonar where any sane gamer should go to personalize their audio. In Sonar, as well as customizing your spatial audio, you can dig down deeper to modify things like volume and EQ, but not just for your games, for any of your audio sources&mdash;chat and other apps included.</p>



<p>Modifying the EQ for games is especially awesome, since this can be done on a parametric chart. The sky&rsquo;s the limit for what you can achieve with this tool. While most players simply have to accept whatever sound settings their game dishes up, with a Parametric EQ chart you can emphasize any sounds you like, or effectively silence those you don&rsquo;t&mdash;and nothing&rsquo;s off the table; whether it&rsquo;s your character clicking armor into place, your enemies&rsquo; footsteps, or your character&rsquo;s voice, if you know roughly what the frequency of the sound is, you can change it.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1363250" height="759" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Arctis-Nova-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Dota 2 preset in Sonar highlights game sounds that fall in the bass, upper mids, and highs.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>Sonar also provides you with ready-made presets for popular games like <em>Dota 2</em>, <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, and <em>CounterStrike: Global Offensive</em>, if you don&rsquo;t want to spend time tinkering yourself to create your own.</p>



<p>These presets seem to be well engineered for their respective titles too. But just to make sure, I tried out the <em>Dota 2 </em>preset and compared it against a default one. By raising the bass, upper mids, and high tones and scooping out the mids, this preset really emphasized explosions and the crackle of thunder, when compared to the plain-old default setting.</p>



<p>Suffice to say, this brought a whole new dimension to what would have been a relatively normal game of <em>Dota 2</em> for me, further qualifying the Nova 3 as an excellent headset for gaming, in my opinion.</p>



<h3 id="should-you-buy-the-steelseries-arctis-nova-3">Should you buy the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3?</h3>



<p>The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3 is extremely lightweight and feels super snug and comfortable on your head. It also sounds great in games, movies, and music, producing a warm and punchy sound that you never get tired of, although it&rsquo;s not that great at blocking ambient noise. While it&rsquo;s mostly made of plastic, the Nova 3&rsquo;s stylish cans and flashy RGB lighting never fail to impress every time you put it on.</p>

## Black Friday 2022: How to get the best prices on tech, and where to shop

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Black Friday used to be a single day of shopping excess. People woke up early the day after Thanksgiving, headed to malls, and fought over deeply discounted sweaters, coffee makers, and TVs. If you looked hard enough, you could find amazing deep discounts amid piles of questionable &ldquo;bargains.&rdquo; A while later online retailers cooked up Cyber Monday in a bid for some of that free-flowing cash.</p>



<p>Over time, Black Friday and Cyber Monday melted together to form one long, holiday weekend of sales. Then that four-day period gradually morphed into sales throughout November. Recently, the deals even began leaking into October, though that still remains light.</p>



<p>This year, the big question isn&rsquo;t when the sales will start rolling out. That&rsquo;s already begun, with some of the deals shockingly good. Instead, you&rsquo;ll need to guess at when&rsquo;s the right time to buy. Retailers seem eager to offload excess inventory, but if you try to hold out for the absolutely best prices, you could miss out all together. </p>



<p>Our tips below will simplify deal hunting and make it easier to spot a juicy deal. Let&rsquo;s dig in!</p>



<h2 id="when-is-black-friday-this-year">When is Black Friday this year?</h2>



<p>Technically, Black Friday is always the fourth Friday of November&mdash;the day after Thanksgiving. For 2022, that&rsquo;s November 25. It&rsquo;ll be followed by Cyber Monday on November 28. But retailers don&rsquo;t follow the calendar anymore&mdash;as mentioned above, Black Friday discounts have already begun.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2016/11/11224169706_65711570f5_o-100691314-orig.jpg&amp;xcust=2-1-402850-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Black Friday shopping doorbusters" src="https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2016/11/11224169706_65711570f5_o-100691314-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a></figure></div>




<h2 id="how-to-get-the-best-black-friday-tech-deals">How to get the best Black Friday tech deals</h2>



<h3 id="option-1-let-us-do-the-work">Option 1: Let us do the work</h3>



<p>The easiest way to score rock-bottom prices is to let us find them for you. As they begin, check back here for links to the top deals we&rsquo;ve found.</p>



<h3 id="option-2-wade-into-the-fray-with-our-help">Option 2: Wade into the fray with our help</h3>



<p>The other option is to strike out on your own. It&rsquo;s not hard if you&rsquo;re prepared&mdash;you just need to set aside time for it. Even then, you can zip pretty fast through all websites, circulars, forum posts, and email newsletters if you follow these tips.</p>



<h4 id="make-a-plan-and-a-budget">Make a plan (and a budget)</h4>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Sample Trello board for Black Friday shopping 2022" class="wp-image-1371963" height="592" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/trello_bf.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Jotting down your planned purchases helps in knowing when to pull the trigger on a deal&mdash;and for keeping track of all the packages that come &nbsp;in.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>To actually save money&mdash;and not blow that cash on just more stuff&mdash;you need to make a plan. Whether it&rsquo;s in your head or written out concretely, know in advance what you plan to shop for, the price you prefer to pay, and the max price you&rsquo;re willing to pay.</p>



<p>This list will look different for everyone. For me, the price I prefer to pay usually involves a hefty discount, and my max price usually isn&rsquo;t too much higher. I also make note of products I use regularly and should stock up on, items I might need to replace soon, and stuff I&rsquo;ve considered buying if deeply discounted.</p>



<p>Bargain hunting doesn&rsquo;t always go predictably, of course. Some years, you&rsquo;ll nail nearly every major thing on your list. During other years, you&rsquo;ll find a deal on just a few things, but also unexpectedly snag five stackable 1-year licenses for Microsoft Office 365 Personal for $15 each. (Please bring that one back, Newegg.) But having a plan means you&rsquo;ll know exactly what to keep an eye out for, and what&rsquo;s worth zeroing in on.</p>



<h4 id="research-prices-in-advance">Research prices in advance</h4>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Keepa data for 5600G" class="wp-image-1371964" height="467" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/keepa2022.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Keepa is a site that shows detailed historical price data for products sold on Amazon. Camelcamelcamel is another popular alternative.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>Not all deals that crop up during Black Friday are good discounts. Many are mediocre and designed to lure you spending money because you think you&rsquo;re getting a bargain.</p>



<p>Doing research on the products you want to buy can save you some serious cash, whether or not you make a spending plan. A few different sites can help provide the background knowledge you&rsquo;ll need:</p>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://keepa.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-402850-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Keepa.com</a> or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://camelcamelcamel.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-402850-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Camelcamelcamel.com</a>:</strong> These sites show historical price information for products on Amazon. Because there&rsquo;s a graph showing the trend over time, you can tell how often a product goes on sale, what the most common sale prices are, and what the lowest price was.</li><li><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blackfriday.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-402850-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"><strong>BlackFriday.com</strong></a>: More retailers have begun releasing their circulars early, but for those that haven&rsquo;t, sites like BlackFriday.com publish scans of leaked Black Friday ads for major retailers (Best Buy, Target, Newegg, Fry&rsquo;s, Micro Center, etc.). While none of these prices are guaranteed to go live, these scans provide early reconnaissance on which retailers will have which products on sale, and roughly what the prices will be.</li><li><strong><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://slickdeals.net/&amp;xcust=2-1-402850-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Slickdeals.net</a>:</strong> This set of forums crowdsources deal-hunting. Frontpage deals are supposed to be the absolute <em>cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me</em> of the bunch, while a fire hose of daily deals lives in the Hot Deals forum. Search for a product name or model number to see any posts related to it. Not all products will have results (or relevant results), but sometimes you can find the last best price on a product and when that was. Keep your search term as simple as possible (just one or two keywords specific to the item) to improve your results.</li></ul><p>If you plan to take advantage of Amazon&rsquo;s Lightning deals, which don&rsquo;t reveal the sale price until the deal starts, doing this research in advance is particularly useful. When a Lightning deal goes live, you&rsquo;ll know immediately if it&rsquo;s worth your time.</p>



<h4 id="set-deal-alerts-on-slickdeals-and-amazon">Set deal alerts on Slickdeals and Amazon</h4>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/11/bffaq_slickdeals_2019-100816396-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="bffaq slickdeals 2019" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/11/bffaq_slickdeals_2019-100816396-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption><p>Using Slickdeals&rsquo; alert feature can help you catch deals that you might otherwise miss.</p></figcaption></figure></div>




<p>If you sign up for a free account on Slickdeals, you can set up to 200 different deal alerts that can ping you via email, the Slickdeals mobile app, private message through the site, and/or desktop browser notifications. (You&rsquo;ll receive a notice whenever a member posts a deal that matches your keywords.) These alerts can be customized based on popularity and forum.</p>



<p>Amazon offers a similar service for its Lightning deals, which are available for only a limited time on the site. (They expire at a certain time or when the allotted inventory runs out, whichever comes first.) If you use the Amazon app on your phone or tablet, you can get alerts when the deal starts by &ldquo;watching&rdquo; the deal.</p>



<p>You can also set deal alerts through <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://camelcamelcamel.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-402850-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Camelcamelcamel.com</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://keepa.com&amp;xcust=2-1-402850-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Keepa.com</a> for Amazon deals, but they don&rsquo;t always get sent in time to act on the deal. Still, setting them up doesn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>



<h4 id="sign-up-for-email-newsletters-at-specific-stores">Sign up for email newsletters at specific stores</h4>



<p>Email newsletters can be a good source of deals, for a few reasons.</p>



<p>Some deals are only available if you&rsquo;re already on the store&rsquo;s email list. Newegg, for example, often creates coupon codes that only work for email subscribers.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="newegg email list signup form" class="wp-image-1371967" height="500" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/newegg2022.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Signing up for a store&rsquo;s email newsletter can alert you to hot sales.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>Other sites offer codes for discounts and free shipping through their email newsletters that don&rsquo;t always show up on deal and coupon sites.</p>



<p>Then there are the places with niche items that rarely go on sale (like Apple products). Even if the product still stays at normal price during Black Friday, some vendors will at least provide a gift with purchase.</p>



<p>Note: If inbox clutter is a concern, you can use either a filter or a junk email address to collect all the email in one spot. You usually don&rsquo;t need to use the same email address at checkout for the code to work.</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MicroCenter bundle deal for 13900K" class="wp-image-1371968" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mc2022.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Micro Center often&nbsp;has CPU/motherboard bundle discounts. When combined with their insanely low in-store prices during Black Friday, you can save some serious cash.</p>

<p>Shopping for PC parts? Pay attention to the retailers that favor bundle and combo deals. That&rsquo;s typically Newegg and Micro Center, but on occasion other stores offer them as well.</p>



<p>You can save quite a bit this way&mdash;for example, Micro Center often offers a combo discount for buying a CPU and a motherboard at the same time. That&rsquo;s in addition to already-reduced prices on both components.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-free-shipping-during-black-friday">How to get free shipping during Black Friday</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1371969" height="564" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Most big-box retailers offer free shipping for orders over a certain threshold or free in-store pickup.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Over the last few years, free shipping has become more of a given&mdash;and before the pandemic, next-day and 2-day shipping were even dangled as an incentive. You should still expect to see free standard shipping (usually for orders over $35) and free curbside pick-up for purchases made at major retailers (as applicable). We recommend signing up for newsletters now, so that you&rsquo;ll get notified of any free shipping promotions between now and the end of December. You can unsubscribe after you&rsquo;re done with your shopping.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-return-black-friday-purchases">How to return Black Friday purchases</h2>



<p>Return policies vary across stores, but most U.S. retailers extend their windows for returns and exchanges for items purchased in November and most of December. Be sure to read the return policy for each site you shop at. One particularly novel promotion is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/promotions/nepro/22-1909/index.html&amp;xcust=2-1-402850-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Newegg&rsquo;s price-match guarantee</a>, which has returned for a third year: If you purchase an eligible item between November 1 through November 20 and it drops in price on or before November 26, you&rsquo;ll be automatically refunded the difference.</p>



<p>Also, before making a purchase, check to see if it&rsquo;s easy to return the item and if it will cost you anything (like a restocking fee or shipping). If you&rsquo;re not careful, you could lose money on the purchase should you end up not needing it.</p>
