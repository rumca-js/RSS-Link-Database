Sure, each year meant an increase in price. But there clearly were enough firms using Windows 7 to keep Microsoft in the business of patching the old OS.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3678853/for-windows-8-the-end-is-near.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.computerworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/3679070/apple-covid-19-will-hit-iphone-supplies.html#tk.rss_all", "title": "Apple: COVID-19 will hit iPhone supplies", "date_published": "2022-11-07 12:31:00+00:00", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p>Apple has warned that COVID-related disruptions mean it will not be able to meet demand for iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, forcing customers to wait longer to get hold of the new smartphones and undercutting sales in the current quarter.</p><h2><strong>iPhone production hit by new lockdowns</strong></h2>\n<p>The company confirmed this news in a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/11/update-on-supply-of-iphone-14-pro-and-iphone-14-pro-max/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">short statement on Sunday</a>.
