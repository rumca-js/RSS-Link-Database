<p>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse accomplished the impossible task of introducing us to not one but six Spider-Men, including, somehow, Spider-Ham. We're excited to see who will appear in the sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, and today we got one answer; Daniel Kaluuya (Nope, Black Panther) will join the cast as Spider-Punk, according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-daniel-kaluuya-spider-punk-1235256848/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p>Details on the story itself are light--Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) will once again team up with Spider-Gwen (Hailee Steinfeld) to fight a new villain. Kaluuya will voice Hobart "Hobie" Brown, better known as Spider-Punk. Spider-Punk first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man in January 2015. In the comics, Spider-Punk is an unhoused teen given powers via a spider irradiated by Norman Osborn's toxic waste dumping, who then leads the people of New York against Osborn.</p><p>Spider-Punk will be familiar to more than just comic fans, as his is one of many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/spider-man-remastered-suits-how-to-unlock-all-spider-suits/2900-2243/">variant suits</a> available in Insomniac's 2018 game. The Spider-Punk suit comes with the Rock Out special ability, which sends enemies flying with a soundwave from his spider-themed star-body guitar.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-casts-daniel-kaluuya-as-spider-punk/1100-6508979/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Beginning sometime in 2023, AMC Theaters and Zoom are coming together to allow audience members to video chat from the comfort of their local movie theater. The two companies announced the collaboration in a small press release that gave faint details, but <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/amc-theatres-zoom-1235425471/">Variety</a> is reporting at least 17 AMC locations across the United States will work together with Zoom to facilitate conference calls between "small, medium and large-sized groups" in different venues.</p><p>Additional services like food and beverage selections, possible movie viewings, and other meeting needs will also be available at an additional cost, the release also said.</p><p>It's hard to imagine that dazzling images on a huge silver screen just means choppy video of your friends or even your bosses if for some reason they decide to host a post-Wakanda Forever conference call. The hope for the collaboration is to enable companies with decentralized workforces and customer bases to meet for "cohesive virtual and in-person events and meeting experiences".</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amc-where-heartbreak-feels-good-will-now-let-you-get-fired-via-zoom-in-its-theaters/1100-6508978/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Where To Preorder God Of War Ragnarok Ahead Of Wednesday's Launch

<p>The wait is just about over. God of War Ragnarok <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-release-time-and-how-to-play-at-launch/1100-6508975/">releases this Wednesday, November 9</a> for PS5 and PS4. It's easily one of the biggest games of the year, so naturally it has multiple editions--four to be exact. Unfortunately, the two priciest editions--the Collector's and Jotnar--are currently sold out. It's possible that retailers will restock on launch day, but it's certainly not guaranteed. Even if you can't get your hands on one of those editions, it makes sense to <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/god-of-war-ragnarok-launch-edition-playstation-5/6513126.p?skuId=6513126&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=__ARTICLE_NAME__&amp;article_url=__ARTICLE_URL__&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value">preorder God of War Ragnarok,</a> </span> since you'll get some bonus content with the Launch Edition.</p><p>Though God of War Ragnarok is releasing on both PS5 and PS4, you'll definitely get the most out of the game on PS5. PlayStation is releasing God of War Ragnarok PS5 and PS5 Digital bundles that come with a voucher for the game. The PS5 bundle costs $560, while the PS5 Digital bundle goes for $460. You're saving 10 bucks versus buying the console and game separately.</p><h2>God of War Ragnarok Preorder Bonuses</h2><figure style="width: 1024px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4000727-godofwarbonus.jpg"><img alt="God of War Launch Edition bonsues" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4000727-godofwarbonus.jpg" /></a><figcaption>God of War Launch Edition bonsues</figcaption></figure><p>If you preorder any edition of God of War Ragnarok, <strong>you'll receive two in-game cosmetics: Kratos Risen Snow Armor and Atreus Risen Snow Tunic</strong>. These are "Launch Edition" bonuses, so the code will be in the box or added to your PlayStation account upon purchasing a digital version. Though there's a chance you can snag the Launch Edition in stores without preordering on November 9, your best bet is to preorder. After all, God of War Ragnarok will undoubtedly be one of the best-selling games of the holiday season.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-preorder-god-of-war-ragnarok-ahead-of-wednesdays-launch/1100-6504424/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Anyone who has ever played a Call of Duty game is likely all too familiar with a certain level of toxicity from other players. Hearing derogatory and horrific comments made over voice chat is not uncommon in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii/">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</a>. Activision has now outlined what it's doing to try to combat some of this behavior and clean up the battlefield.</p><p>Modern Warfare II features an "overhauled" in-game reporting system, Activision said in a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2022/11/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-II-anti-toxicity-in-game-reporting-system">blog post.</a> Players have new ways to report bad actors, while Activision's moderation teams are stepping up their game to help stamp out jerks.</p><p>"If a player is verified to be engaging in offensive voice chat, for example, our system upgrade now allows the moderation team to mute that player globally from all in-game voice chat features.

For this dimensions' Luka, the "truth" is he exists "to get Bayonetta to where she needs to be." Bayonetta's truth is never explicitly stated.

That's a far cry from its launch, where the most notable thing about it was that it housed every season of The Office, becoming the series' home after Netflix.</p><p dir="ltr">Getting those rights made Peacock an immediate competitor, and its agreements with WWE and NBC Sports further solidified its staying power. Couple that with a first-rate collection of films--a combination of modern originals and standby classics, thanks to the sheer size of the NBCUniversal library--and it's easy to see why it's such an enticing service. However, if there's one critique, it's that the content rotates so quickly—what launched today could be gone in two months or less.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="[Various] Sign up for Peacock">    <div class="buylink__container">                                                                                                                                                                                               <div class="buylink__item">                  <div class="buylink__image-container clickable">                                            <img alt="" class="buylink__image" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/3807476-peacock.jpg" />                                 <a href="https://imp.i305175.net/c/159047/828265/11640?&amp;utm_campaign=20200101evergreen&amp;cid=20200101evergreenpdaffil001&amp;u=https://www.peacocktv.com/&amp;subId1=[subid_value]"></a>                              </div>                   <div class="buylink__text">                      <p class="buylink__title text-bold">                        <a href="https://imp.i305175.net/c/159047/828265/11640?&amp;utm_campaign=20200101evergreen&amp;cid=20200101evergreenpdaffil001&amp;u=https://www.peacocktv.com/&amp;subId1=[subid_value]">Sign up for Peacock</a>           </p>                                                       <p class="buylink__deck">                          <a href="https://imp.i305175.net/c/159047/828265/11640?&amp;utm_campaign=20200101evergreen&amp;cid=20200101evergreenpdaffil001&amp;u=https://www.peacocktv.com/&amp;subId1=[subid_value]">Get 1-year of Peacock Premium for $20 until November 19.</a>             </p>                                              </div>                  <div class="buylink__links">                                                                                                                                                          <a href="https://imp.i305175.net/c/159047/828265/11640?&amp;utm_campaign=20200101evergreen&amp;cid=20200101evergreenpdaffil001&amp;u=https://www.peacocktv.com/&amp;subId1=[subid_value]">See at Peacock TV</a>                     </div>                         </div>                     </div> </div></div><p dir="ltr">If you're in the mood for action movies, Peacock has some pretty awesome options that will speak to the cinematic adrenaline junky you are.

And that's a shame, because the satire and action are both on point. Give this film a shot.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10.

As she gets smarter, she learns quicker and reads faster, but that quickly evolves into mind control, levitation, and moving through space-time.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>12.

This was post-World War II. And fears about the atomic bomb, two of which hit Japan, took physical form in a 50-meter tall, fire-breathing lizard known as Godzilla. Future movies softened the character into a sort of anti-hero. But this iteration embodied pure, existential terror.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>13. Furious 7</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4059586-furious7.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Starring: </strong>Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Director(s):</strong> James Wan</p><p>The seventh film in the Furious franchise depicts Dom and the gang coming out of retirement, to protect themselves from the brother of Owen Shaw. It is an enjoyable formula that's been given additional depth, because it is Paul Walker's last film. The filmmakers dedicated <em>Furious 7</em> to his memory, and they used a combination of CGI and stand-ins (Walker's brothers) to complete his role.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>14. You're Next</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4059600-yourenext.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Starring: </strong>Sharni Vinson</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Director(s): </strong>Adam Wingard</p><p dir="ltr">It's a home invasion movie with a twist--the main character is a capable survivalist who's game for everything the bad guys throw at her. But it's also a family drama, containing intergenerational dynamics and sibling rivalries that, in this context, are darkly comical.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>15.

X-Men: First Class</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4059599-x-men.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Starring: </strong>James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Rose Byrne, Jennifer Lawrence</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Director(s): </strong>Matthew Vaughn</p><p>The X-Men franchise lost all its steam with <em>The Last Stand</em>. And so, <em>X-Men: First Class</em> went back in time--back to when Charles and Eric were still young men, tracking down young mutants to train and teach. Some years later, this would lead to <em>X-Men: Days of Future Past</em>, which merged the two timelines together.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>18. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4059588-harrypotter.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Starring: </strong>Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Director(s): </strong>David Yates</p><p>None of the other Harry Potter movies, with their private school intrigue and detective/mystery tropes, could be classified as action. But the eighth and final film definitely qualifies. The filmmakers got all the plot and buildup out of the way in <em>Death Hallows: Part I</em>. <em>Part II</em> is wand battle after wand battle, plus the final showdown between Voldemort and Harry Potter. There are strong Potter movies and weak Potter movies, but one thing is for sure; the franchise stuck the landing.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>19. The Man From Nowhere</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4059596-manfromnowhere.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Starring: </strong>Won Bin</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Director(s): </strong>Lee Jeong-beom</p><p>This is about a former intelligence operative who causes bloody mayhem after the little girl who lives next door is kidnapped by a crime syndicate. If you haven't experienced violent Korean action movies before, this is a great place to start; <em>The Man From Nowhere</em> won numerous awards in Asia at the time of its release, with many nods for its cinematography and acting performances.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>20. Jurassic Park</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4059592-jurassic.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Starring: </strong>Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Director(s): </strong>Steven Spielberg</p><p><em>Jurassic Park</em> is one of Spielberg's most imaginative, awe-inspiring films. Based on the original novel by Michael Crichton, it takes its premise--"What if we could bring dinosaurs back to life?"-and runs with it, serving as both an aspiration and a cautionary tale. Plus, the special effects still look great. Spielberg had the wisdom and restraint to not go overboard, and he combined the practical and the CGI into something realistic.</p></h3></p><br />

As such, this remake will be the first time that it's available to a global audience. The last proper Front Mission game was 5: Scars of the War, which came out only in Japan in 2005--an English fan patch exists, however.

<p>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet fans might want to lock down their social media accounts, as just two weeks out from release, spoilers for the game have begun popping up online.

This isn't the first time that a mainline entry in the Pokemon series has leaked information out early, and Nintendo is usually <em>very </em>quick to respond in shutting down any information spillage from its unreleased games, but you'll want to start looking at muting keywords if you want to enter the Paldea region with a fresh perspective.</p><p>Leaking information on Pokemon games usually isn't worth the internet clout, as Nintendo won't hesitate to unleash its super-effective legal team on anyone that it catches poaching information from its games.

Packed with big explosions, well-choreographed fight sequences, one-liners galore, and just enough cheesiness to allow its films to age like fine wine, the '80s had it all.</p><p dir="ltr">Sandwiched between the gritty 1970s and the evolving special effects of the 1990s, the decade that gave birth to MTV, Cabbage Patch Dolls, and acid-washed jeans always delivered. Loaded with beefy stars, body oil, synthesizers, and mullets, action films from 1980-1989 were fast-paced, loved an underdog, and flat-out fun. Naturally, this made films from the decade teeming with some of the most stunning and enjoyable action scenes.</p><p dir="ltr">Here are our picks for the 20 moments that made some fun films more than three decades old still bingeable today, along with the time stamp to find their best moments.

At the 29-minute mark Murtaugh (Danny Glover) and Riggs (Mel Gibson) respond to a call about a jumper on the top of a building. Riggs handcuffs himself to the jumper, forcing the suddenly reluctant man off the building into a giant airbag below.

Taking over creative after Vince McMahon stepped down, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/triple-h-takes-over-wwe-as-leadership-roles-change/1100-6505828/">Paul "Triple H" Levesque</a> has pumped new life into the wrestling promotion, and part of the way he's done that is to bring back beloved wrestlers that were let go in the past two years. Most recently, Emma (known as Tenille Dashwood outside of the company) returned to the company on an episode of Smackdown. In addition to her, Bray Wyatt, Luke Gallows, and Karl Anderson have all found their way back to WWE.</p><p>There's been a lot going on in WWE the past few years. Over 100 wrestlers were released from the company, and some whose contracts were up decided to step away from the company. In the wake of all these releases and budget cuts, the head of WWE, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-ceo-vince-mcmahon-retires-amid-scandal/1100-6505790/">Vince McMahon, stepped down from his position</a> and retired after it was found <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vince-mcmahon-has-paid-more-than-12-million-in-hush-money-investigation-shows/1100-6505254/">he paid millions in hush money to women</a>. That led to the previously mentioned changes in leadership.</p><p>And changes are already happening since the new leadership took over. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paul-levesque-wants-to-create-more-moments-like-brock-lesnar-on-a-tractor/1100-6506513/">Levesque is hoping to make to create more memorable moments</a>--like Brock Lesnar driving a tractor to the ring. One of the ways WWE is beginning to do that is to bring back some of the talent WWE let go over the past two years.</p><p>Starting at Summerslam 2022, a week after the change in leadership at the company, we saw that, and it will undoubtably continue, so we're keeping track. And throughout the rest of the year, we'll be updating the returns to WWE. But for now, check out the released wrestlers WWE rehired after Vince McMahon left.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>B Fab</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4022048-bfab.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Released:</strong> November 19, 2021</p><p><strong>Redebuted:</strong> August 12, 2022 (Smackdown)</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ashante Adonis</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4022047-ashante_thee_adonis_bio--3a848fc8102db3a930299bc7e99c1b6b.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Released:</strong> November 19, 2021</p><p><strong>Redebuted:</strong> August 12, 2022 (Smackdown)</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Top Dolla</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4022053-topdolla.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Released:</strong> November 19, 2021</p><p><strong>Redebuted:</strong> August 12, 2022 (Smackdown)</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dakota Kai</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4022049-dakotakai.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Released:</strong> April 29, 2022</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Redebuted:</strong> July 30, 2022 (Raw)</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dexter Lumes</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4022050-dexter.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Released:</strong> April 29, 2022</p><p><strong>Redebuted:</strong> August 8, 2022 (Raw)</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Karrion Kross</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4022051-karrion.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Released:</strong> November 4, 2021</p><p><strong>Redebuted:</strong> August 5, 2022 (Smackdown)</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Scarlett</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4022052-scarlett.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Released:</strong> November 4, 2021</p><p><strong>Redebuted:</strong> August 5, 2022 (Smackdown)</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Johnny Gargano</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4024804-untitled-22.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Left WWE:</strong> December 7, 2021</p><p><strong>Redebuted:</strong> August 22, 2022</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Braun Strowman</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4031049-untitled-1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Released:</strong> June 2, 2021</p><p><strong>Redebuted:</strong> September 5, 2022</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Candice LeRae</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4046441-candice.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Left WWE:</strong> May 6, 2022</p><p><strong>Redebuted:</strong> September 26, 2022</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bray Wyatt</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4046440-bray.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Left WWE:</strong> July 31, 2021</p><p><strong>Redebuted:</strong> October 8, 2022</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Karl Anderson</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4046442-karl.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Left WWE:</strong> April 15, 2020</p><p><strong>Redebuted:</strong> October 10, 2022</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Luke Gallows</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4046443-luke.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Left WWE:</strong> April 15, 2020</p><p><strong>Redebuted:</strong> October 10, 2022</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Emma</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4059479-emma.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Left WWE:</strong> October 29, 2017</p><p><strong>Redebuted:</strong> October 28, 2022</p></h3></p><br />

## Hearthstone "March Of The Lich King" - All The Cards Revealed So Far

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4059389-deathknightheroart.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Hearthstone's next expansion will add one of the most requested classes to the game at last. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hearthstone-next-expansion-march-of-the-lich-king-finally-adds-the-death-knight-class/1100-6508753/">March of the Lich King</a> will include 145 new cards, alongside 68 new Death Knight cards to define the new class. The core Death Knight cards will be added for free for all players, while the rest of the new cards will be obtainable through packs.</p><p>That's not the only big new addition to the card pool. March of the Lich King will introduce Signature cards, a new level of rarity that includes special card art. Each expansion will include its own look for the Signature cards. You can't craft or disenchant them. March of the Lich King will include 18 Signature cards.</p><p>The new Death Knight's cards look very different than the norm, too, thanks to one of its unique mechanics. Death Knights use a special Rune system to determine their special abilities from three types: Blood, Frost, or Unholy. Each rune takes up one of three slots, letting you build 10 different combinations. For example, you could slot in two Blood and one Frost rune, letting you use Level 2 Blood spells and Level 1 Frost spells. Or you could place Blood in all three Rune slots to use the most powerful Blood spells, but you'd be unable to use any Frost or Unholy spells.</p><p>The Death Knight will also have a unique corpse counter, which acts as a resource for some spells. Every time a minion dies it adds another body to the Lich King's corpses, which can then be tapped to cast your abilities.</p><p>March of the Lich King is coming on December 6, with card reveals scheduled to come regularly until the release date. Preorders are now available for March of the Lich King bundles. In the lead-up to the launch, Blizzard has brought back all of the cards from the previous Death Knight-themed expansion, Knights of the Frozen Throne. You can also login now to claim a free card from the upcoming expansion, the neutral legendary spell The Sunwell, which you can put into your decks now.</p><p>You can check out all of the cards we've seen so far below.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Acolyte of Death</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4059390-acolyteofdeath-80089_normal.png" /></p><br />

<p>2009's Avatar is the highest-grossing movie of all time, but writer-director James Cameron isn't sure his sequels, including Avatar: The Way of Water and Avatar 3, will find an audience.

## Review Roundup For Sonic Frontiers

<p>3D Sonic games don't usually have a good track record, but Sega is aiming to change that with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-frontiers/">Sonic Frontiers</a>. A bigger and more ambitious Sonic game in which the blue blur finds himself stuck on an island inhabited by dangerous mechanized threats, Sonic Frontiers reviews is out November 8, and reviews have gone live ahead of its launch.</p><p>So far, most reviews have painted a picture of a flawed but charming game that might just be the best 3D Sonic adventure in a very long time. "Sonic Frontiers marks a bold new direction for the series, meshing traditional Sonic action with an open-ended approach to progression and exploration across its semi-open world," Richard Wakeling said in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-frontiers-review-sonic-is-that-you/1900-6417995/">Sonic Frontiers review</a>.</p><p>A number of reviews have praised the game for how it shakes up the standard Sonic formula, although the camera, controls, and a few annoying mid-level bosses have been criticized. The good news according to critics is that Sonic Frontiers runs closer to Sonic Adventure than it does the infamously terrible Sonic '06, and as a template for what Sega can do in future games, it's a solid step forward for the company's iconic mascot.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-sonic-frontiers/1100-6508958/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Bungie Is Adjusting A Destiny 2 Weapon Type Sooner Than Expected

<p dir="ltr">Bungie was planning to roll out some changes to Destiny 2's Linear Fusion Rifles as part of its upcoming Season 19, but the developer has decided to fast-track them with a hotfix. While the full patch notes will be available on Tuesday, it's pretty clear that these changes represent a fairly substantial nerf for these precision laser rifles.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">We are making some adjustments to Lineal Fusion Rifles. These were initially planned for Season 19 but have been brought forward to Hotfix 6.2.5.3, launching 11/8. The changes are as follows:</p>  — Bungie Help (@BungieHelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1588581053048180736?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">November 4, 2022</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">According to Bungie, these Linear Fusion Rifle shifts include increasing the flinch and settle type in PvP, reducing the settle time in PvE, and reducing the aim-assist cone size for special ammo. This essentially means that these rifles will be slightly more difficult to use in PvP, as getting hit will scramble your aim more than it used to. However, these weapons should be slightly easier to use in PvE.</p><p dir="ltr">As the Destiny 2 subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/ym4s15/linear_fusion_rifle_nerf_coming_on_tuesday/">shows</a>, this is apparently a follow-up to a recent change that affected the flinch of sniper rifles, but not Linear Fusion Rifles. The response to the patch seems mostly positive, as players consider two LFRs--Arbalest and Lorentz--to be overpowered in the current PvP meta, since they're capable of one-shotting unaware opponents with a well-placed headshot.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-is-adjusting-a-destiny-2-weapon-type-sooner-than-expected/1100-6508957/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">This December, Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dragonlance - Shadow of the Dragon Queen hits stores. Long title aside, this is the first time Dragonlance content enters Fifth Edition, so that's a pretty big deal. This is a book that will bring your characters to war. Additionally, alongside the book, there's an accompanying board game, but how does that all work?</p><p dir="ltr">At a press conference for the upcoming game, GameSpot got an inside look at the functionality of the board game--titled Warriors of Krynn. It can be purchased alongside the Shadow of the Dragon Queen sourcebook or separately.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">The biggest question is "Do you have to use the book and the game with each other?" In short, you don't have to. However, using the two together can add some fun to the gameplay. Game designer Rob Daviau told press that it's a supplement to Shadow of the Dragon Queen, but it isn't necessary.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-the-dungeons-dragons-dragonlance-book-and-board-game-function/1100-6508946/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>After a long wait, God of War Ragnarok officially launches on PS5 and PS4 on November 9, a date which just so happens to be shortly after the world ends. According to Norse legends that is, as a total lunar eclipse has been forecast for this week.</p><p>As spotted by Twitter and TikTok user <a href="https://twitter.com/EmManuDoll">EmManuDoll</a>, the celestial event is a rare occurrence in which Earth, the sun, and the moon are aligned with each other. This creates a phenomenon known as a Blood Moon, which in ancient Norse mythology, signals the beginning of the end of the world. As EmManuDoll, the Blood Moon was seen as a sign that the wolves Skoll and Hati had succeeded in capturing the sun and the moon, devouring them and beginning the cycle of Ragnarok.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/SonySantaMonica?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">@SonySantaMonica</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">@PlayStation</a> - can you confirm this for me? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GodofWarRagnarok?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#GodofWarRagnarok</a> <a href="https://t.co/6thTulTE6S">pic.twitter.com/6thTulTE6S</a></p>  — 🏳️‍🌈❤𝕄𝕒𝕟𝕦𝔻𝕠𝕝𝕝❤🏳️‍🌈 (@EmManuDoll) <a href="https://twitter.com/EmManuDoll/status/1588763374854500352?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">November 5, 2022</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The Blood Moon will enter its umbra phase visible on November 8 (around 02:17 AM PT / 05:17 AM ET if you want to set an alarm clock) <a href="https://www.space.com/blood-moon-lunar-eclipse-november-2022-what-time">according to NASA</a> and the event will last for 85 minutes.

<p>The wait is over. A full trailer has arrived for Glass Onion, the sequel to Knives Out, and we finally have a good idea of what Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc is up against for the next murder mystery.</p><p>Directed by Rian Johnson, the follow-up to the smash hit 2019 film will arrived on Netflix on December 23--and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery-will-spend-one-week-in-theaters/1100-6508097/">in theaters for one week only on November 23</a>. The latest trailer is almost three minutes long and gives you a pretty good idea of what the movie is about. Is there a murder? Of course there is. Is there a colorful cast of characters? Yep. Will Blanc have to solve this crime while chaos happens all around him? Yes. Check out the Glass Onion trailer below.</p><div>          </div><p>In the trailer, Miles Bron (Ed Norton) invites a group of people, including Blanc, to Greece to solve his murder--which is supposed to be a game. However, someone actually dies during this event, and of course, it's up to Blanc to solve the mystery once again.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery-trailer-features-murder-intrigue-and-bautistas-pecs-popping/1100-6508950/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Microsoft is reportedly exploring new ways to make its Xbox Series X|S console more energy-efficient, as the company sent out a recent questionnaire to members of the Xbox Insider program.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-exploring-energy-saving-graphics-modes-for-xbox-and-windows-games">Windows Central</a>, the company is exploring a list of potential graphical options across PC and console, by dialing back certain graphical features in games. The survey asks if participants would be willing to play games with reduced graphics--such as lower resolutions and frame rates--in return for reduced power consumption from an Xbox console or PC. This feature could potentially applied to games that are active or inactive, and Microsoft wants to know how users would like these features to be branded, with examples such as "eco-saving" and "energy-saving" listed.</p><p>There's no concrete number for just how much power a user would be able to save if they switched their game from a regular quality or performance mode option for one with an energy-saving setup, but this proposed idea follows on from several other green ideas that Microsoft has implemented during its current Xbox cycle.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-energy-saving-graphics-modes-reportedly-being-explored-by-microsoft/1100-6508943/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Guzzlord is making its debut in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/">Pokemon Go</a> Gyms near you for its first appearance in five-star raid battles. This Ultra Beast is the headliner of Pokemon Go’s first “Greedy Gluttons” event, with more information to come about the full details of that event.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Guzzlord Raid Schedule</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Guzzlord will appear as the only five-star raid boss in Pokemon Go starting at 10 AM local time on November 8, 2022 and will remain available to battle until the same time on November 23. Raids do not generally follow a set schedule, and Guzzlord raids will appear randomly at Gyms around the world during this time period, but you will receive a notification from the game when a raid is about to begin nearby. Like other Ultra Beasts, Guzzlord raids will be signified by an Ultra Wormhole appearing on top of a Gym instead of a typical raid egg.</p><p dir="ltr">Your best chance to find Guzzlord raids is during the Raid Hours in which the Junkivore Pokemon will be featured. Every Wednesday from 6 PM to 7 PM local time, the majority of Gyms host five-star raids for Trainers to work together to take down. Guzzlord will be the featured raid boss in the raid hours on November 9 and 16, 2022.

## Sonic Frontiers First 20 Minutes of Gameplay

## Sonic Frontiers Review - Sonic, Is That You?
 - [https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-frontiers-review-sonic-is-that-you/1900-6417995/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-frontiers-review-sonic-is-that-you/1900-6417995/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)

<p dir="ltr">From the moment it was first revealed, it was clear that Sonic Frontiers is quite unlike any of its predecessors. Sonic's 3D adventures have been more miss than hit throughout the blue hedgehog's 31-year existence. For every Sonic Generations, there's been a Sonic Boom or Sonic '06 leaving behind a bitter taste and further diluting the speedy mascot's appeal. Each new game has offered some variation on the Sonic formula, hoping to catch lightning in a bottle and finally give the series a consistent direction moving forward, but none have succeeded--at least until now. Sonic Frontiers is that game.</p><p dir="ltr">It certainly has its flaws and still maintains many of the familiar elements you'd expect to find in a game starring the eponymous hedgehog, but it's in the differences where Sonic Frontiers stands out and occasionally excels, making it the best 3D Sonic game in more than a decade.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest and most notable change is the shift to a semi-open world. Sega calls Frontiers "open-zone," meaning the game is split into multiple islands that Sonic is free to explore. Each zone has its own aesthetic, from verdant rolling hills to arid desert plains and a simmering volcanic island floating above the clouds, meshing together natural beauty with ancient alien temples, grind rails, and bounce pads. It's a curious amalgamation but one that works well enough within the game's sci-fi conceit. The environments are also part of a striking tonal shift for the series. The vibrant primary colors of classic Sonic levels like Green Hill Zone have been replaced by a color palette that's low on saturation and high on pastel hues. The obvious inspiration here is The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, not just in the way Frontiers looks, but in its use of music and the shift to open-ended world design. It doesn't play anything like Link's five-year-old adventure, but you can see how Sonic Team was influenced by it throughout.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-frontiers-review-sonic-is-that-you/1900-6417995/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Starfield Won't Be Skyrim In Space, Xbox Games Boss Says

<p>Starfield looks set to contain a number of classic Bethesda gameplay elements, but don't expect this game to be a big-budget Skyrim in space. Speaking on the Friends Per Second vlogcast (featuring GameSpot's Lucy James), Xbox Games boss Matt Booty briefly discussed progress on the game and how Bethesda is pushing the envelope on a game that mixes "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-aesthetic-aims-to-be-nasa-punk/1100-6500847/">NASA-punk</a>" designs with traditional genre elements such as ship-building, space combat, and world exploration under game director Todd Howard.</p><div>          </div><p>"I'm confident that he's not going to sit still on what was built before. It's not his approach to come in and reskin something," Booty said. "There's going to be an awful lot of things that move forward with this game. I think there's going to be an awful lot of new stuff that Bethesda fans and Todd Howard fans have not seen, brought to the game. I know just from checking in with them the team is hard at work to get that thing all buttoned up and put together. I'm fortunate enough to be involved in the status reports and things, and it's just fun watching them iterate through that level of polish on the game right now."</p><p>One Bethesda trademark that you can expect in Starfield <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-will-have-classic-bethesda-style-dialogue-options-todd-howard-says/1100-6508223/">are dialogue options</a> that harken back to older games from the company. The big difference here is that players can use Starfield's persuasion system to push a conversation in a direction that favors them. Players will have a specific number of turns and persuasion points from which to select various dialogue options as they attempt to convince NPCs to give in to their demands.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-wont-be-skyrim-in-space-xbox-games-boss-says/1100-6508940/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A new Fable game from Forza Horizon developer Playground Games sounds like an odd match-up, but according to Xbox Game Studios boss Matt Booty, the developer brought key elements to its vision that managed to erase any skepticism he had. Speaking on the Friends Per Second vlogcast (featuring GameSpot's Lucy James), Booty explained that Playground Games brought a mix of high quality, crafting, and attention to detail to its Fable pitch, as well as plenty of love for the franchise.</p><div>          </div><p>"They had a particular passion for the IP, and they also demonstrated that they understand what the heart and soul of Fable is about, and how they can bring it forward for today's sensibilities," Booty said. "Some of the things that I've seen are so encouraging. They've got a great technology base and they've just got such a demonstrated commitment to crafting quality. During some of the first reviews, I shared a little bit of skepticism, but they've since put that to rest and I'm excited for everybody to see it when we're ready to show stuff."</p><p>The Fable franchise has been in limbo since the last entry in the series, the free-to-play digital collectible card game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fable-fortune/">Fable Fortune</a>, was released back in 2018. At one point the series looked set to make a comeback with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fable-legends/">Fable Legends</a>, a co-op action-RPG where a team of players would explore dangerous locations while another player acted as the dungeon-master, but this project <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-dev-lionhead-officially-closes/1100-6439331/">was canceled in 2016 when developer Lions Head was closed down</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-boss-says-new-fable-is-being-developed-by-a-team-that-brings-quality-and-passion-to-the-series/1100-6508939/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Since then, the developer has been slowly rebuilding while dealing with the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic, as Xbox Studios boss Matt Booty explained in a recent episode of Friends Per Second (which also features GameSpot's Lucy James).</p><div>          </div><p>"I think one of the most difficult things of the last few years has been filing a big game on the scale of a Halo or a Battlefield during the conditions that we had. Number two has got to be starting up a new studio," Booty said, explaining how The Initiative has gone through an employee reboot as of late. "Number two has got to be starting up a new studio. You don't have the shared history, you don't have the people that have worked together for five and ten years. We were doing a lot of of experimenting with remote and hybrid, how we could attract talent, some of it worked, some of it didn't. It has been less leadership changes and more just the work of building a studio. It's a brand new studio."</p><p>Tomb Raider studio Crystal Dynamics (and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-sells-tomb-raider-deus-ex-studios-and-ip-rights-to-embracer-group/1100-6502977/">one of the latest acquisitions of Embracer Group</a>) <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-will-still-co-develop-perfect-dark-reboot-after-embracer-group-acquisition/1100-6502979/">is also helping out on Perfect Dark alongside The Initiative</a>, with Booty describing the partnership as co-development and not outsourcing.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-xbox-boss-gives-a-new-update/1100-6508938/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
