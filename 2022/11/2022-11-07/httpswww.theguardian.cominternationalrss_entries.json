He vibed the sort of age, where you can\u2019t see things without glasses. He described how he met Maria Alyokhina (who also goes by Masha Alekhina), one of the founding members of the band who was first imprisoned in 2012 and then under constant surveillance, harassment, house arrest, arrest-arrest and persecution, until she escaped from Russia to Iceland earlier this year. When her sentence was handed down 10 years ago, he said, it was the first time in his life he had witnessed the political imprisonment of artists.</p><p>This was a useful bit of context, or rather, a glass of cold water to the face, after years of somnambulance: no one is laughing at Vladimir Putin now, of course, but for years, he was almost a figure of fun, with his bare-chested, horse-riding photoshoots and florid turn of phrase. On the world stage, he was the uncle who might say dodgy things, but got invited anyway: what was the worst that could happen? This indulgent, pretty feckless view of Putin was overlaid by the sense that Russia merely did things differently; perhaps the state was a bit thin-skinned and hotheaded, maybe it didn\u2019t prioritise human rights as much as one would like, but this was a cultural thing, probably related to the weather.

This column began decades ago, when I decided I was afraid of pressure cookers. Raking back though unreliable memories, it isn\u2019t clear why, exactly, I was afraid. We didn\u2019t have one at home, and relatives who did weren\u2019t using them any more by the time we were growing up. There was no incident in the house next door, no scaremongering public-information film that had lodged itself in my mind. Unexplained fear became a quiet hang-up to which I clung even as pressure cookers evolved dramatically. Some of the best cooks I know told me to get over it.</p><p>Actually, this column began with a French physicist, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Papin\">Denis Papin</a>. Born near Blois in 1647, he studied medicine before moving to Paris, where he assisted the Dutch physicist Christian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-197023,00.html\">Huygens</a> in building vacuum pumps. Later, in England, Papin worked with the physicist <a href=\"https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/robert-boyle\">Robert Boyle</a> \u2013 whose pressure and volume of gas theory is known as Boyle\u2019s Law \u2013 and built air pumps for the Royal Society of London. Papin\u2019s research explored the relationship between boiling temperature and the surrounding pressure. When you cook in an ordinary pot at atmospheric pressure, water boils at 100C until it escapes as steam. Inside a sealed vessel, however, the trapped steam molecules move faster, increasing the surrounding pressure, which means the water boils at 121C. In 1679, Papin demonstrated a sensational invention: a closed vessel with a tight-fitting lid in which steam under pressure was used to cook food and soften bones; his \u201cdigesting engine\u201d. One featurewas a small, weighted piston that moved up and released steam; a pressure-relief valve \u2013 and the original model for all modern pressure-cookers.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/nov/07/how-rachel-roddy-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-pressure-cooker\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/07/the-box-review-mexican-teens-search-for-missing-father-attains-tragic-status", "title": "The Box review \u2013 Mexican teen\u2019s search for missing father attains tragic status", "date_published": "2022-11-07 11:00:59+00:00", "description": "<p>Hatz\u00edn Navarrete makes an impressive debut as a boy searching for the truth about his parent in a hostile world</p><p>Hatz\u00edn is an adolescent kid from Mexico City, first met arriving in northern Mexico near the US border.

Offered a box and an identification card with a barely discernible photo of the dead man, Hatz\u00edn sets off on the long journey back, but changes his mind and jumps off the bus when he sees a man who looks like the picture on the ID card.

No wonder many new parents resent the cult of compulsory joy</p><p>Of all the phrases parents tell me they dislike, \u201ccherish every moment\u201d is the winner. Time is a strange thing when you are caring for small humans, and, as I thought about it this week, it is this phrase that keeps coming back to me. It\u2019s the idea that by feeling any negative emotion, you are somehow squandering time. I have been told by parents with postnatal mental health issues that this unrealistic phrase \u2013 often said by older people \u2013 has made them feel deep shame. Time is precious, and to not feel constantly delighted by your child is a terrible waste.<br /><br />I don\u2019t feel shame, but I\u2019ll confess that the occasional suggestion that this column is overly negative has wounded me. I\u2019ve been writing it in real time these past eight months \u2013 I wrote notes for my first column while in hospital, the sounds of women in labour all around me \u2013 and though there have been struggles, there have also been immense, intense highs. My son still feels miraculous to me. But writing as it happens means real, living feelings land on the page, some dark, some light. There\u2019s no time to try to temper reality in retrospect to make it seem like it\u2019s always plain sailing.<br /><br />When I see new parents out and about with newborns, I feel solidarity but also a strange mix of other emotions. He was once so small and curled like a bug \u2013 how could that time have passed so quickly? Why did I not realise how short those days would be? At the time they felt unceasing; in the whirl of feed, sleep, feed, sleep I could not see an end to them. The baby and I were still one, and would cease to be. He would open his eyes to the world and look beyond me, and I would be gifted a whole new phase, while mourning that which came before. At the time, the shock of his premature<strong> </strong>arrival left little room for reflection \u2013 but had you asked me, I\u2019d have maybe said that I felt that the time in the third trimester, when the baby should have still been safe inside me, had been lost, or even stolen. Now I say I got five extra weeks of him. What a gift, this time travel.<br /><br />When you are raising a child, it isn\u2019t that the hard parts aren\u2019t hard, but that time marches on so indefatigably that they almost mystically fade. Older people, I think, understand this, which is why they often can\u2019t remember when you ask them about specific aspects of parenting, such as my mum not recalling when she moved on from giving me purees, or how they coped with certain difficulties. (In case it sounds as though her memory is going, she just recited TS Eliot to the baby: \u201cI have measured out my life with coffee spoons.\u201d I could measure the last year of mine in formula scoops, I thought.)</p><p>Women have said to me that they suspect this amnesia might be evolutionary, otherwise no one would have a second child. Time makes you sentimental, and pain fades in the memory, with sleeplessness rendering whole stages \u2013 where the passing of time felt like treacle \u2013 a blur. I\u2019m starting to understand that. The hell of establishing breastfeeding felt, at the time, all consuming. I doubt I\u2019ll ever fully forget it, but thinking about it now is like watching a film about someone else, while sitting a great distance from the screen.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/07/cherish-moment-motherhood-baby-new-parents\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/07/southampton-sack-ralph-hasenhuttl-as-manager-with-club-in-relegation-zone", "title": "Southampton sack Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl as manager with club in relegation zone", "date_published": "2022-11-07 10:40:22+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>Hasenh\u00fcttl dismissed following 4-1 home defeat by Newcastle</li><li>Southampton hopeful of appointing Nathan Jones from Luton </li></ul><p>Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl has been sacked as Southampton\u2019s manager following a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/06/southampton-newcastle-premier-league-match-report\">4-1 home defeat by Newcastle</a> on Sunday left the team in the Premier League relegation zone.
