A LOT of time. Politics stands still until polls close and there is nothing left but counting, prognosticating, and waiting to see what shenanigans the left tries to pull. But perhaps I've said too much... for Facebook. We won't have those problems on Rumble.</p><p>There are few better ways to pass the time than with music. In my past life as a member of the cursed consultant class, Election Day usually meant a lot of traveling followed by a lot of drinking and refreshing of board of election websites. These are a bunch of songs I used in my travels to get pumped.</p><p>If you are expecting an uplifting collection of tunes singing the praises of the American political process, this is not the playlist for you. To the extent any of these songs are political, it's a more cynical outlook of politics and politicians. The first two lines of the first song are <em>"What became of everyone I used to know/Where did our respectable convictions go?"</em> </p><p>It's also a lot of artists I'm sure don't appreciate having their name mentioned on the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website. But we don't appreciate them all having dumb political opinions.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"></div><p>Enjoy. Rest up. And we'll see you at 8:00 PM eastern for <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/midterm-election-2022-crowderelectionstream" target="_self"><strong>Crowder’s 2022 Midterm Election Livestream</strong></a>.

## Can Republican Lee Zeldin pull off the upset and become New York governor?

That's the question I get asked by neighbors, little league parents, and randos on the Internet. People expect me to know these things and appreciate my insight for reasons I never quite grasped.</p><p>A Republican hasn't pulled it off since the 90s. The last three to try got shellacked. But there have been a number of polls that, at the very least, show Zeldin within striking distance if not ahead. As for whether he can pull off the upset or not... I'm not going to tell you.</p><p>It's not that I don't have a gut feeling and/or thoughts on the matter. It's that I don't want to say the words out loud. To quote the greatest political mind of this or any other generation...</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="d32c6" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32056513&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>What I <em>WILL</em> do is share with you two anecdotal points from events that have stood out to me. You are free to draw your own conclusions from there.</p><p><strong>1. Ron DeSantis came to campaign for Zeldin.</strong> Glenn Youngkin too. I've worked on enough statewide campaigns in New York to know it's hard enough to get someone to sign off on letting you use their name for a fundraising email. Zeldin got AMERICA'S GOVERNOR to campaign for him. Ron DeSantis left his own state -- in the middle of his own reelection campaign -- to help Lee on his. One could be inclined to assume that Gov. DeSantis saw data that led him to believe it would be a worthwhile trip. If, you know, one was inclined to make that assumption.</p><p><strong>2. New York City.</strong> We discussed the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/new-york-governor-2022" target="_blank">early voting numbers last week</a>. NYC turnout is WAY DOWN both from where it was two years ago and compared to the rest of the state this year. Democrats are in a panic and are calling in all reinforcements to the only two counties Democrats care about in New York. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kathy-hochul-hillary-clinton" target="_blank">Hillary Clinton</a>. Kamala. The Bidens. Bill Clinton did five minutes<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-clinton-crime" target="_blank"> yucking it up with Hochu; about New Yorkers concerned with crime</a>. Hochul's NYC supporters are in such a panic, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lee-zeldin-supporter" target="_blank">they are assaulting Zeldin's supporters</a>. That's not what winners do.</p><p>These are things that stand out to me. If they stand out to you to the point you tempt the wrath of the whatever by saying so out loud, I can't stop you. I can only ask you to be mindful of the rest of us. Because while I won't say out loud if I think Lee Zeldin will win, I sure as hell want him to.</p><p><p>

## Editor's Pick: This Election Day, make every Democrat who harmed our kids’ education pay

Bethany "Grandma Killer" Mandel, who is in all our prayers after getting into a bad car accident. Mary Katherine Ham, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/angry-parent-explains-mad" target="_blank">who did her best to warn people last year</a>. And Karol Markowicz, who reminds voters it's now their turn.</p><p>Karol is one of the many, many, many former NYers who left the anti-science streets of New York City for the freedom-loving land of Flordia. She was lucky that she was able to move. Many families in America were not. But as Karol says <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/11/06/this-election-day-make-every-democrat-who-harmed-our-kids-education-pay/" target="_blank">in her must-read New York Post piece</a>, those families have their chance on Tuesday.</p><blockquote>What is possible is electoral punishment. Every Democrat who listened to Weingarten as if she were some kind of authority and not just a thug using a calamity to collect riches for her members should be held responsible Tuesday. Every politician who urged lockdowns past spring 2020, when we knew their pointlessness and damage, has to be voted out.<br /><br />Every elected official who forced masks on children while pooh-poohing the scarring it would invariably cause has to go. As late as last month, New York City children who hadn’t gotten the COVID vaccine could not participate in sports. Anyone who supported this barbaric targeting of kids must be held liable.<br /></blockquote><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

## Get the popcorn: Elon Musk makes a MAJOR midterm endorsement that leftists are gonna go berserk over

We owe the New York Times an apology. When the unbiased NYT reported Elon Musk was a chaos agent, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-nyt-chaos-agent" target="_blank">we accused them of writing a hit piece</a>. Turns out, their sources may have been more accurate than LwC assumed. Musk is a chaos agent.</p><p>It's the only way to explain this tweet, today:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">To independent-minded voters:<br /><br />Shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties, therefore I recommend voting for a Republican Congress, given that the Presidency is Democratic.<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1589639376186724354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Musk addressed his fellow independent-minded voters: "Shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties, therefore I recommend voting for a Republican Congress, given that the Presidency is Democratic."</p><p>We go now live to... well, every democrat operative and journalismer everywhere.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="f414c" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32054636&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Our dude can't stop...</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Hardcore Democrats or Republicans never vote for the other side, so independent voters are the ones who actually decide who’s in charge!<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1589644018727936001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>WON'T stop...</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">If you don’t like Twitter anymore, there is awesome site called Masterbatedone <a href="https://t.co/Jl7lpC5oEu">pic.twitter.com/Jl7lpC5oEu</a><br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1589646682710417408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Obviously, everyone here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website agrees with the Chief Twit. Now so much about the "independent-minded' part. We agree on the part about yeeting democrats out of office and skinny-dipping in their tears.</p><p>We're also not surprised. Musk said earlier this year he was voting Republican. He cast his first vote for a GOPer ever when he <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mayra-flores-texas-elon-musk" target="_blank">voted for Rep. Mayra Flores</a>. Elon also endorsed <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-responds-elon-musk" target="_blank">America's Governor Ron DeSantis</a> should DeSantis (God willing) decide to run for president.</p><p>All that aside, Musk made his midterm endorsement after going goblin mode (which I think is what the kids call "beast mode" these days) on various leftists so hard, they're all very emotional right now. This tweet will push them over the edge.  And I'm starting to run out of popcorn.</p><p><p>

## Stacey Abrams blames her low poll numbers on black men, claims they lack ability to see through 'misinformation'

Or, being expected to lose. Remember, you don't want to tempt the wrath of the whatever from high atop the thing. But <em>IF</em> democrats lose, it won't be their own fault because it never is. It's always a voting bloc to blame for not understanding how awesome the left is. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sonny-hostin-roaches" target="_blank">White women were already catching heat</a>. It turns out black men could be to blame too! That's according to celebrity election-denier Stacey Abrams.</p><p>Abrams was asked why she was doing so poorly in the polls. She blames black men for not knowing any better.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Stacey Abrams explaining her poll numbers: "Unfortunately, this year, black men have been a very targeted population for misinformation.

</p><p>In 2018, Abrams got 96% of the African-American vote. Polls now have her at only 82%. She blames black men and all the alleged "misinformation" they fall for. Or, it could be black men, white women, and every other American share the same concern: the economy.</p><p>While Stacey Abrams <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/stacey-abrams-men-control-bodies" target="_blank">is talking about abortion</a>, Gov. Brian Kemp is talking about the economy. And while Stacey Abrams' fix for the economy <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/stacey-abrams-inflation-abortion" target="_blank">is more abortions</a>, Kemp's fix is more jobs.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I think there's a pretty simple reason Kemp might be doing better with black men than he did in 2018. A few days ago he was at the groundbreaking of a Hyundai electric vehicle plant outside Savannah, the largest economic development in GA history. It's jobs.<br />— Zaid Jilani (@ZaidJilani) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZaidJilani/status/1589116102638211077?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>I would never speak on behalf of black men. I am not of the community, and unlike white liberals don't feel it's my place to tell them how they are supposed to act and feel about things. Though, I know that I personally don't appreciate it when leftists blame white men for their own shortcomings. If I were to guess, that's something we all have in common.</p><p><p>

The crime-denier is at risk of losing IN NEW YORK, so she needs to call in every Democrat available to try and save her. That includes disgraced former president, and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jeffrey-epstein-bill-clinton-girls" target="_blank">Jeffrey Epstein associate</a>, Bill Clinton. Who then *checks notes* mocks voters' concerns about crime.</p><p>Side note: Hochul also said at a Sunday rally with Joe Biden that Democrats have a "messaging" problem.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="instagram-media"><div style="padding: 16px;"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CkoVC6jt-jh/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;" target="_blank"> <div style="display: flex;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"></div> <div style="display: flex;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;"></div></div></div><div style="padding: 19% 0;"></div> <div style="display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;"></div><div style="padding-top: 8px;"> <div style="color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style="padding: 12.5% 0;"></div> <div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;"><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div style="margin-left: 8px;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;"></div> <div></div></div><div style="margin-left: auto;"> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;"></div></div></a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CkoVC6jt-jh/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">A post shared by Lee Zeldin (@leezeldin)</a><br /></div></blockquote> </div><blockquote>Lee Zeldin makes it sound like Kathy Hochul gets up every morning, goes to the nearest subway stop, and hands out billy clubs and baseball bats before everybody gets on the subway.</blockquote><p>If you listen closely, you can hear Kathy Hochul laughing about it.

## Here we go again: Dave Chappelle announced as this week's SNL host and leftists are freaking out

It started the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/snl-savages-nyc-liberals-watching-2016-election" target="_blank">Saturday after the 2016 election</a>, where because <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chapelle-giving-trump-chance" target="_blank">Chappelle didn't sh*t on Trump</a>, leftists assumed that made him a Trump supporter. </p><p>The comedian has since squared off against the left's #1 pound-for-pound most marginalized group. Suddenly, saying common sense things about election results isn't the worst thing Chappelle has ever done. </p><p>Leftists are freaking out that SNL would give "someone" "like" Chappelle a platform. <a href="https://twitchy.com/samj-3930/2022/11/06/haters-screeching-over-dave-chappelle-hosting-snl-screech-more-when-redsteeze-retweets-them-and-lol/" target="_blank">Twitchy</a> has a rundown of all the hate. Since AP Journalisming standards say <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/scooby-doo-velma-video-game" target="_blank">you only need three examples</a> of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-jk-rowling" target="_blank">idiots having the same opinion</a> to write about it, these are my favorites.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Why are we giving this man a platform?<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ProtectTransKids?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ProtectTransKids</a> 🏳️⚧️🏳️⚧️🏳️⚧️ <a href="https://t.co/DrVqeiWmnx">https://t.co/DrVqeiWmnx</a><br />— Tom Soares (@tommyverse) <a href="https://twitter.com/tommyverse/status/1589118428014841856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Because Chappelle is the best to ever do it. And because SNL is considered to still be a comedy program.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Sorry, but Dave Chappelle’s a terrible choice for a host…like, you mean to tell me that you most likely know about his transphobia all too well (since it was quite hard to ignore given how it was all over the news, after all) and yet you still plan to let him host? Shame on you! <a href="https://t.co/noJrPdR0G9">https://t.co/noJrPdR0G9</a><br />— Em | #COVIDIsNotOver | VOTE ON 11/08, AMERICA | ψ (@EmilyAllsMusic) <a href="https://twitter.com/EmilyAllsMusic/status/1589119782313693184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>I am sure SNL producers watch the news and know all about the controversy you mention. They also know "oooh...that controversy will create ratings."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">hey <a href="https://twitter.com/nbcsnl?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nbcsnl</a>, isn’t one of your new cast members a non-binary person? i wonder how they feel about this. <a href="https://t.co/EA99MtizHc">https://t.co/EA99MtizHc</a><br />— madeleine (@dungeonturge) <a href="https://twitter.com/dungeonturge/status/1589133823056703488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>This is an educated guess. I don't know the non-binary cast member personally. Or, even know their name or who you are talking about. But I'm guessing what they would think about it is "oh my God, Dave Chappelle, I'm such a big fan."</p><p>Here's a bonus tweet, because they managed to work Elon Musk gutting Twitter into it. Though now that I read it over, I think it could be sarcasm. Either way, it has me LOLing.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Twitter used to have an entire department that would currently be rallying the twitter mob and pressuring corporations to pull their ads. <a href="https://t.co/ZLAoBZ3UQy">https://t.co/ZLAoBZ3UQy</a><br />— Rosie's No Amnesty Policy (@DarnelSugarfoo) <a href="https://twitter.com/DarnelSugarfoo/status/1589121330972364802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>I'm not saying Chappelle hosting will get me to watch SNL. I'll wait until the following morning as I review clips for clickbait like a normal person. The outrage is enough to sustain us all throughout the week. Outrage, that will only grow worse after Tuesday and slacktivists need a new target.</p><p><p>

Lee Zeldin was choked while she was peacefully protesting outside of a Gov. Kathy Hochul rally. Crime-denier Hochul is in a panic she, a Democrat, could lose tomorrow and is attempting to drive voter turnout in New York City <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kathy-hochul-msnbc" target="_blank">after ignoring voters' concerns about crime</a>. Citizen journalist Viral News NY caught the incident on camera.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Breakingnews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Breakingnews</a> <br />A fight breaks out during the <a href="https://twitter.com/GovKathyHochul?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GovKathyHochul</a> rally in NYC between Hochul supporters and Zeldin supporters <br />For licensing email viralnewsnyc@gmail.com <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NEWS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NEWS</a> <a href="https://t.co/TPzI4nDi43">pic.twitter.com/TPzI4nDi43</a><br />— Viral News NY (@ViralNewsNYC) <a href="https://twitter.com/ViralNewsNYC/status/1589011987652313090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Unclear is if the man was a Hochul supporter standing outside a Kathy Hochul rally. Had the roles been reversed -- a Hochul supporter choked outside of a Zeldin rally -- corporate media wouldn't wait for confirmation before blaming every Republican everywhere. They'd also report how it was a white man choking a voter of color. The fact the Zeldin supporter was a voter of color and the (alleged) Hochul supporter was a white man won't get as much cable news play.</p><p>The woman, Angelica Torres, says she "never wanted to get physical with anyone.

Zeldin addressed the matter, issuing a statement "I have always condemned political violence of any kind, and Kathy Hochul must do the same. Her continued silence on her supporter choking out a woman simply exercising her First Amendment rights makes her complicit in this attack."</p><p>There has been an increase in attacks on Republicans, thanks in part to the extreme rhetoric coming from Biden-Hochul Democrats. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-speech-wednesday" target="_blank">A republican New Hampshire</a> senate candidate was assaulted on his way to a debate. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-speech-illinois-voicemail" target="_blank">A republican gubernatorial candidate in Illinois</a> was threatened to be skinned alive.

He also claimed, without evidence, that the GOP is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cnn-chyron-georgia" target="_self">trying to suppress the rights of voters</a>.</p><p>We have also seen Joe Biden, believed to be the most divisive president this decade, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/extreme-rhetoric-democrats-2022" target="_self">lash out at half the country</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/filibuster-jen-psaki-peter-doocy" target="_self">claim they're racist </a>for <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-tulsi-gabbard" target="_self">disagreeing with him on legislation</a> or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/slavery-doocy-jean-pierre-kamala" target="_self">Supreme Court decisions</a>. Now supporters of his opponents are getting attacked in the streets.</p><p>Joe Biden and Kathy Hochul should denounce these violent acts by their supporters before someone gets hurt. I wouldn't count on them having the courage to do so.</p><p><p>
