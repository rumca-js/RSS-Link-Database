<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Graphics card prices may be falling at last, but they still can&rsquo;t beat the value of gaming consoles. Especially not when you can get up to 1440p gaming at a stunningly low price, thanks to a deal on the Xbox Series S. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.target.com/p/xbox-series-s-8211-holiday-console/-/A-86908930&amp;xcust=2-2-1384352-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Right now at Target</a>, $250 gets you the console <em>and</em> a bonus $50 Target gift card.</p>



<p>If you shop at Target often (i.e., you&rsquo;d spend $50 on groceries or other goods in the future as a matter of course), this makes the effective price of the Xbox Series S just $200. That&rsquo;s 33 percent off the MSRP and a smoking price. You can make it sweeter too, if you have a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.target.com/redcard&amp;xcust=2-2-1384352-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Target Red Card</a>&mdash;you can stack your usual 5% discount on top of this special.</p>



<p>In the box you&rsquo;ll get the console, plus a controller, power cable, and HDMI cable. As Microsoft&rsquo;s entry-level Xbox Series machine, the S has a smaller 512GB SSD and 10GB RAM, and lacks an optical drive. But it still plays games at high-quality 1080p and 1440p gaming, which is plenty for diving into the latest titles. Plus, given its all-digital nature, it pairs nicely with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397667/get-3-years-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-tip.html">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>



<p>Target lists this deal as available until Saturday, November 19th, and it&rsquo;s online only. The $50 gift card will be applied when the console ships or you pick it from the store. But as with all great deals, don&rsquo;t sit on this if you&rsquo;re interested, as it could end early if stock runs out.</p>

Not only does the Acer Aspire Vero 14 laptop deliver zippy performance, but it&rsquo;s also made out of recycled materials. According to Acer, it consists of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.acer.com/ee-en/laptops/aspire/aspire-vero&amp;xcust=2-1-1383613-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">30% post-consumer recycled materials</a>.

<p>The Vero has an Intel Core i7-1255U CPU, Intel Iris Xe graphics, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of NVMe PCIe SSD storage. That&rsquo;s plenty of oomph for web browsing, watching Netflix, storing photos, and so on. If you want to check out specific benchmarks, take a gander at <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1358891/acer-aspire-vero-14-review-from-trash-to-treasure.html">our review</a>, in which we rated the Vero four out of five stars. Battery life is a real standout, though. The Vero flew right past the 10 hour mark in our extensive battery test, which is nothing to sneeze at.</p>



<p>You really can&rsquo;t go wrong with the Vero. It offers decent performance as well as impressive battery life. The deal price is absolutely killer, too.</p>

</div>


<p>VPNs and ad blockers help you surf the web privately so that websites and advertisers can&rsquo;t track your online activities to learn where you go and what you do. You&rsquo;ll find a plethora of VPNs and ad blockers with different price tags and degrees of effectiveness, but one program worth trying is Windscribe. Defined as a VPN with ad and tracker blocking at its core, Windscribe adds other privacy features of value and attempts to make the whole process as simple and seamless as possible.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: This review is part of our ongoing roundup of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html">the best VPNs</a>. Go there to learn about competing products, what to look for in a VPN, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="windscribe-pro-features">Windscribe Pro: Features</h2>



<p>Windscribe is available for a variety of platforms. Beyond the desktop versions for Windows, macOS, and Linux, there are mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Blackberry OS. Browser extensions are accessible for Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. There are even versions for certain smart TV systems and for router configurations. For this review, I focused on the Windows version&mdash;which supports Windows 7, 8, 10, and 11&mdash;and on the browser extensions.</p>



<p>With the Windows program and browser extension working as a team, Windscribe provides several benefits. Working silently in the background, the VPN keeps your web traffic private using standard protocols such as WireGuard, IKEv2, and OpenVPN. For its lineup of VPN servers, Windscribe offers access to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://windscribe.com/status&amp;xcust=2-1-407657-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">112 city locations across 69 different countries</a>. A feature dubbed <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://windscribe.com/features/robert&amp;xcust=2-1-407657-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">R.O.B.E.R.T.</a> is a customizable DNS and IP level blocker for the Windows client capable of blocking ads, trackers, malware, and objectional websites (gambling, adult content, crypto mining, etc.). Additionally, a MAC address spoofing tool can disguise your PC&rsquo;s hardware address.</p>



<p>Plus, more advanced options are available. A <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://windscribe.com/features/port-forwarding&amp;xcust=2-1-407657-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">port forwarding feature</a> lets you securely access your home computer, network, or NAS remotely via a Windscribe connection. A <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://windscribe.com/features/config-generators&amp;xcust=2-1-407657-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Config Generator</a> helps you create configuration files for different VPN protocols. And though the IP address assigned to your computer will change dynamically, there is an option to upgrade to a static address.</p>



<h2 id="windscribe-free-vs-pro-edition">Windscribe Free vs. Pro edition</h2>



<p>As with many internet and security products, Windscribe comes in a free edition as well as a subscription-based Pro mode. The free flavor restricts the number of VPN locations and the amount of bandwidth you can use. By default, you&rsquo;re granted 2GB of bandwidth per month. Adding and confirming your email address boosts that to 10GB per month. Otherwise, the free plan imposes no speed or performance caps.</p>



<p>The Pro flavor grants you access to all the VPN city locations around the world as well as unlimited bandwidth. This plan also offers three different options depending on what you need and how much you want to pay. The less expensive Pro subscription costs $5.75 per month when billed annually, while the more expensive one costs $9 per month when billed monthly. Feature-wise, though, the two are exactly the same.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.windscribe.com/vpn-build-a-plan/&amp;xcust=2-1-407657-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Build-a-Plan</a> option lets you pay only for what you use via an a-la-carte approach. Don&rsquo;t need or want access to all the accessible VPN servers? You can limit the scope to just certain server locations. For example, you could buy access to all 35 VPN server locations in the US for $1. For each country you add, you get an extra 10GB of data per month. You can also grab unlimited data for your plan for another $1 a month. Ultimately, you need to spend at least $3 per month if you opt to build your own plan.</p>

</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Windscribe</p></div>



<h2 id="windscribe-pro-installation">Windscribe Pro: Installation</h2>



<p>The Windscribe setup process is smooth and helpful. After installing the software, clicking the <em>Get Started</em> button takes you to the website to create a free account if you haven&rsquo;t yet done so. After supplying your username, a password, and an optional email address, return to the software to sign in with your new account.</p>



<p>By default, the Windows client picks the best VPN server based on location and availability, though you can easily change this. Select the country or region you wish to use, such as the U.S., the UK, Canada, Italy, Australia, Japan, or South Korea. Then pick a specific city, such as New York in the U.S. or Rome in Italy. Your VPN server and IP address change based on your selection. Choosing your VPN server this way can improve performance and let you access region-specific websites, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, and BBC iPlayer.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img alt="Windscribe VPN screen" class="wp-image-1379739" height="571" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Figure-2-Windscribe-Pro-Review.png" width="294" /><figcaption><p>Windscribe offers VPN servers in 112 cities across 69 different countries.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Windscribe</p></div>



<p>Once your VPN server is set, a performance graph shows the speed of your connection. In case you&rsquo;re disconnected from the server, a firewall switch is available should you need to block all connections to your PC. Plus, settings are accessible to determine if and how the VPN automatically launches, how the list of VPN locations is sorted, whether the firewall kicks in automatically or manually, and whether you wish to spoof your PC&rsquo;s MAC address.</p>



<h2 id="windscribe-pro-browser-extension">Windscribe Pro: Browser extension</h2>



<p>You must be wondering: Why use a browser extension when you&rsquo;ve already got the Windows client? Windscribe explains the reasons in this <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDZvxXEN3mI&amp;xcust=2-1-407657-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">handy YouTube video</a>. In a nutshell, the extension is designed to reduce your online footprint among advertisers and tracking sites, shield your online activities from your ISP, and speed up your browsing by eliminating online ads and trackers. The browser extensions rate highly, with the ones for Firefox, Chrome, and Edge mostly garnering five stars from users.</p>



<p>The extension offers a short tutorial to show you which buttons control which features. As you can with the Windows client, you&rsquo;re able to turn the extension&rsquo;s VPN on and off, allow it to select the best VPN server or choose one yourself, and control what gets blocked&mdash;ads, malware, social network sites, cookies, and more. Plus, you can whitelist specific sites that you don&rsquo;t want affected by the blocking.</p>

<h2 id="windscribe-pro-help-and-support">Windscribe Pro: Help and support</h2>



<p>To help you with the software, Windscribe offers tips and instructions along the way right when you need them. There&rsquo;s no live phone support, but there are several other options. For self-help, you can turn to online setup guides, a Knowledge Base, and an FAQ. And if you need technical support, you can submit a ticket, talk to a chatbot named Garry, or consult Windscribe&rsquo;s subreddit.</p>



<h2 id="windscribe-pro-security-and-privacy">Windscribe Pro: Security and privacy</h2>



<p>Based in Canada, Windscribe is a small operation founded in 2015 by Yegor Sak. Canada is a member of the Five Eyes Alliance, an organization in which member countries promise to share intelligence data with each other. But that hasn&rsquo;t yet affected Windscribe. The company&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://windscribe.com/transparency&amp;xcust=2-1-407657-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">transparency report</a> shows that it has rejected all requests for user information from government agencies due to a lack of relevant data.</p>



<p>Windscribe has also managed to avoid most security breaches and related problems. But there was an incident in 2021 in which Ukrainian authorities seized Windscribe VPN servers in the country and were able to access the private key as the servers were unencrypted. In response, Windscribe implemented a diskless setup with RAM nodes to better secure data and increased staff to address these types of threats. A <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.security.org/privacy-guide/windscribe/&amp;xcust=2-1-407657-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">privacy report from Security.org</a> gave Windscribe a grade of 7.7 out of 10, giving a thumb&rsquo;s down to the lack of advanced authentication methods and software updates but applauding the privacy policy and the encryption of user data both in transit and at rest.</p>



<h2 id="windscribe-pro-performance">Windscribe Pro: Performance</h2>



<p>Overall, Windscribe worked smoothly. Website loading and performance were generally good with both the Windows client and the browser extension enabled. Browsing to sites such as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://ipleak.net/&amp;xcust=2-1-407657-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">IPLeak</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dnsleaktest.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-407657-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DNS Leak Test</a> confirmed that my actual IP address was obfuscated by the one assigned by a Windscribe VPN server. And with R.O.B.E.R.T. in charge, ads and certain types of websites that I included in the block list were easily blocked. Using region-specific VPN servers, I was able to connect to and stream content from Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and other services, a feat that other VPN products can&rsquo;t always achieve.</p>



<p>I did run into one hiccup. When opening a link with my default web browser, the Windscribe extension wouldn&rsquo;t always load quickly enough to activate. In that case, I&rsquo;d receive a dialog box for a proxy server prompting me to sign in with a username and password. Cancelling the dialog box and refreshing the page allowed me to use the linked site normally, but the interruption still proved frustrating.</p>



<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>



<p>Windscribe is a simple yet effective VPN and ad blocker that does its job well. The Windows client and the browser extensions make for a powerful team that will protect your privacy and block annoying ads and objectionable content as you browse the web. And with the free version of Windscribe already being so good, you can always start there and then jump to the Pro edition if you need more capability.</p>

## Donâ€™t get scammed: Why you canâ€™t trust Elon Muskâ€™s Twitter right now
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1381758/dont-get-scammed-why-you-cant-trust-elon-musks-twitter-right-now.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1381758/dont-get-scammed-why-you-cant-trust-elon-musks-twitter-right-now.html)

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>If you don&rsquo;t use Twitter often, you may be unaware of how the site has dissolved into organizational chaos. But it&rsquo;s a mess right now&mdash;and dangerous as a result.</p>



<p>Prior to the company&rsquo;s sale to Elon Musk, Twitter had a verification process that confirmed the identity of account owners. If the program found you to be who you claimed, a blue checkmark (or gray for the dark mode theme) would appear next to your name. It helped reduce harassment of highly public figures, and allowed users to easily recognize official accounts held by government agencies, newspapers, medical professionals, airlines, large corporations, and other sources of vital information.</p>



<p>But last week, a major (and hugely confusing) change rolled out to the system. The tweak? The verification part got dropped&mdash;but Twitter didn&rsquo;t actually <em>tell </em>people that the badge meant something different now, with no emails or notifications being sent to all users. So here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="that-word-doesnt-mean-what-you-think-it-means">That word doesn&rsquo;t mean what you think it means</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Twitter Blue subscription info (Nov 16 2022)" class="wp-image-1381762" height="435" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/twitterblue.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>The move allows subscribers to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue&amp;xcust=2-1-1381758-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Twitter Blue</a>, the company&rsquo;s optional paid membership, to gain a blue checkmark. No identity vetting is performed. You simply pay $8 per month and get the same scalloped badge as entities as government officials and media outlets.</p>



<p>Sold by Musk as a democratization of the verification process, the revamped feature sparked pandemonium. On November 9th, the first day of the launch, users quickly demonstrated that any account could spoof a verified one with little work. They picked a similar handle as the official account, wrote out their name exactly the same, used the same avatar and cover image, and paid $8 for Twitter Blue. Then they got to work writing whatever they wanted.</p>



<p>A flood of hoax tweets hit the site. The most headline grabbing of them came on day two from a fake account imitating drugmaker Eli Lilly, claiming that insulin would now be free. The pharmaceutical&rsquo;s stock temporarily dropped in response, dragging down its market cap by billions.</p>



<p>In response, Twitter played with different mechanisms to quash impersonations. Some adjustments hit the site, disappeared, and reappeared within hours, like an additional label of &ldquo;Official&rdquo; to verified accounts. The situation remains tumultuous, with constant tinkering to the site promised by Musk on his own (verified) account. The only thing not changing is Twitter&rsquo;s adherence to its new policy.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Elon Musk tweet Nov 9 2022" class="wp-image-1381777" height="601" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/musktweet.png" width="907" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<h2 id="youre-on-your-own">You&rsquo;re on your own</h2>



<p>Without a trustworthy verification process in place, users now have to be responsible for filtering through all the noise. It&rsquo;s a high burden too, requiring constant vigilance and an awareness of the latest methods for spotting genuine accounts among copycats&mdash;again, none of which are being clearly communicated by Twitter to its users.</p>



<p>And no end to this additional work is in sight. Bedlam likely will continue for a while at Twitter. Beyond the verification changes, the company is undergoing extreme internal upheaval. A mass layoff wiped over 50 percent of its workforce, with thousands of additional firings following in the days after. The company has much fewer workers to lean on and has experienced a sizable loss in institutional knowledge.</p>



<p>So how do you stay safe on Twitter? The easiest solution is to just stay away until things settle down at last. That will keep you from accidentally falling for tweets or private messages from fake accounts.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="White House contact page" class="wp-image-1381789" height="745" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/whitehouse-mrk.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Official websites are the best way to find an organization&rsquo;s Twitter info.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>But if you can&rsquo;t bear more traditional methods of getting up-to-the minute news or contacting companies, then you&rsquo;ll have to take extra steps to protect yourself. Currently, you can click on a blue checkmark to see what type it is: if it&rsquo;s from subscribing to Twitter Blue or having undergone the old verification process. But since that method may not stick, you can more reliably start with a known person&rsquo;s or company&rsquo;s website to find their Twitter account information and use those links. And when on Twitter, be mindful of the information you share. The site is now like any other unregulated medium (e.g., email or text message)&mdash;don&rsquo;t reach out or reply to any one without being sure of who they are first. There are likely to be a lot of crypto and banking scams under this new system of &ldquo;verification.&rdquo; Companies that have pulled advertising since the change in ownership could also end up leaving the service all together.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1381818" height="1041" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image-3.png" width="908" /><figcaption>Some of the mayhem sported a hefty dose of humor. Classic Twitter.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In short, be wary when on Twitter. Stay for the memes and jokes; head to your phone and web chat for sensitive customer service needs. Don&rsquo;t expect Twitter to keep you up to date on how to successfully navigate its changes. Its communication team got axed entirely during the mass layoffs.</p>

Its popularity has made USB-C a common sight on new monitors. A USB-C monitor can easily connect with a wide range of devices, from laptops to smartphones; and some USB-C monitors can even charge a connected device while in use.</p>



<p>The details of USB-C can be confusing, however, and pricing for USB-C monitors is often higher than that for monitors that lack the interface. Our guide to the best USB-C monitors will help you pick the right display for your needs.</p>

<p>The Dell U3223QE, which <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">ranks as our best monitor overall</a>, is an excellent USB-C monitor with a huge range of connectivity. It also packs a cutting-edge IPS panel with alluring image quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Connectivity is excellent. The monitor has a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and up to 90 watts of Power Delivery for charging a connected device. It also drives a USB hub with a total of five additional USB-A ports, ethernet, and DisplayPort-out. That&rsquo;s enough to connect a wired mouse, keyboard, and display&mdash;and still have several ports left over for external drives or your smartphone.</p>

<p>This monitor is among the precious few with an IPS Black display panels. As the name implies, this technology improves black levels, offering roughly twice the contrast ratio of competing monitors with IPS panels. Very few monitors have this panel, so it gives the Dell U3223QE a significant edge over its competitors. The monitor also has 4K resolution and superb out-of-the-box color accuracy.</p>

<p>This monitor has a smaller twin, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dell-UltraSharp-U2723QE-27-16/dp/B09TQZP9CL?ots=1&amp;tag=pcworld02-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">Dell U2723QE</a>, which packs the same features and IPS Black panel at a lower price. It&rsquo;s a good choice if you don&rsquo;t want a huge 32-inch monitor or do want a USB-C monitor on a more modest budget.</p>

<p>The NZXT Canvas S27Q is the go-to choice if you want a USB-C monitor and don&rsquo;t need a wide range of USB-C hub connectivity. Its more threadbare feature set helps NZXT deliver USB-C connectivity and superb image quality for less than $300.</p>

<p>This monitor has a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode, meaning it can handle video input. It lacks Power Delivery, however, so the USB-C port won&rsquo;t charge a connected laptop or tablet. The USB-C port connects to two additional USB-A ports. On the plus side, this monitor has two HDMI-in ports and one DisplayPort-In, for a total for four video inputs. Most affordable monitors have just two or three.</p>

<p>The NZXT Canvas S27Q is a 27-inch 1440p monitor with an IPS panel and a refresh rate of up to 165Hz. It also supports AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync, which is good news for gamers.</p>

<p>The monitor has excellent image quality and scores particularly well in color performance and accuracy. It can go toe-to-toe with competitors priced $100 to $200 above it, so it&rsquo;s a great choice if you want maximum value for your money.</p>

<p>The Asus ProArt PA348CGV is a spectacular ultrawide USB-C monitor. It manages to serve a huge range of people, from gamers to prosumers and professionals, without letting anyone down.</p>

<p>This monitor has a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and up to 90 watts of Power Delivery, so it can charge a connected laptop or table. The USB-C port can drive up to four additional USB-A ports, offering a wide range of physical connections. It doesn&rsquo;t support ethernet or video-out, however, so some owners will still need an additional adapter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Image quality is superb. Color accuracy is excellent, the color gamut is wide, and maximum brightness is high. The monitor&rsquo;s 34-inch panel has a resolution of 3440&times;1440, which is roughly equivalent to a 27-inch 1440p monitor and looks sharp in everyday use. The monitor has a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz and supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, which is good news for gamers.</p>

<p>The ProArt PA348CGV is reasonably priced, as well, at $729.99&mdash;not a bargain, but lower than most ultrawide monitors with similar features. Its price, wide range of features, and excellent image quality make the ProArt PA348CGV a great USB-C monitor for gamers and content creators.</p>

<p>The LG DualUp 28MQ780-B is a USB-C monitor with a unique 16:18 aspect ratio that&rsquo;s almost exactly square. It can rotate into a 18:16 aspect ratio if you&rsquo;d prefer. The monitor is much taller than most monitors and, as a result, has an adjustable stand that clamps to the rear of your desk instead of a normal desktop stand.</p>

<p>The monitor&rsquo;s odd form factor is ideal for viewing large, complex documents and can be useful for editing portrait or square photos. It&rsquo;s also well suited for use as a second monitor alongside a large 32-inch display.</p>

<p>The DualUp 28MQ780-B has a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 90 watts of Power Delivery, so it can charge a connected laptop or tablet. The USB-C port can extend connectivity to two additional USB-A ports. Unfortunately, the monitor lacks ethernet or video-out, so some owners may need an additional adapter.</p>

<p>What about image quality? It&rsquo;s great. The monitor has great color accuracy, a wide color gamut, and respectable sharpness thanks to its resolution of 2560&times;2880. Just be warned: The odd aspect ratio makes it a strange fit for gaming and movies. This is a monitor built for work, not play.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-usb-c-monitor">What to look for in a USB-C monitor</h2>



<p>Many features desirable in a USB-C monitor are the same as on any other display. A sharp, vivid, bright, and contrast-rich screen is best. However, shoppers who want to buy a USB-C monitor should keep an eye on details only relevant to USB-C.</p>



<h3 id="power-delivery">Power Delivery</h3>



<p>USB-C Power Delivery provides power over a USB-C cable. It&rsquo;s not part of the core USB-C specification, so devices with USB-C (including monitors) don&rsquo;t always support it. Power Delivery can pack up to 240 watts, but most USB-C monitors provide just 65 to 90 watts. It&rsquo;s a perfect fit for those who own a thin-and-light laptop, 2-in-1, or tablet.</p>



<p>Power Delivery is inadequate for some devices, such as gaming laptops, which consume more power than current USB-C monitors can provide. These laptops may still charge when left at idle but will charge slowly (or even discharge the battery) when in use.</p>



<h3 id="ethernet">Ethernet</h3>



<p>Wired ethernet is a desirable feature in a USB-C monitor. Many modern laptops lack a physical Ethernet port, so its inclusion on a monitor is convenient. It can improve the speed and reliability of a connected device&rsquo;s internet connection.</p>



<p>While useful, this is an expensive feature available only on premium models. The Dell U3223QE is the only USB-C monitor on this list with ethernet support.</p>



<h3 id="displayport-alternate-mode">DisplayPort Alternate Mode</h3>



<p>DisplayPort Alternate Mode is a feature available to USB-C that handles video as if the USB-C cable was a DisplayPort cable. It supports all the features you&rsquo;d expect from DisplayPort including high refresh rates and adaptive sync.</p>



<p>A monitor without this feature won&rsquo;t accept video over USB-C, meaning you&rsquo;ll have to connect both USB-C and a separate video input. All the monitors on this list support DisplayPort Alternate Mode.</p>



<h2 id="how-we-test-monitors">How we test monitors</h2>



<p>PC World&rsquo;s monitor guides are the result of independent tests by PC World staff members and freelance technology journalists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We test each monitor with a SpyderXElite color calibration tool. This tool can measure a monitor&rsquo;s brightness, contrast, color gamut, color accuracy, uniformity, gamma, color temperature, and other important aspects of display quality. Using a tool that measures objective quality helps us objectively compare dozens of monitors.</p>



<p>Our tests of USB-C monitors also consider the range of USB-C connectivity and features available. We prefer to see a USB-C monitor with a complete range of physical connectivity including ethernet and at least 90 watts of Power Delivery, but these desirable features are balanced against the monitor&rsquo;s price.</p>

## Qualcomm dubs Nuvia CPU â€˜Oryon,â€™ on track for 2023

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Qualcomm subtly adjusted its marketing strategy for its PC compute business on Wednesday, naming its next-gen CPU &ldquo;Oryon&rdquo; and claiming that the company&rsquo;s goal was to &ldquo;bring the best of the smartphone to your laptop.&rdquo; Qualcomm didn&rsquo;t announce a new PC CPU chipset, however.</p>



<p>Qualcomm wasn&rsquo;t expected to show the fruits of its Nuvia acquisition, revealing earlier this year that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/695069/qualcomm-signals-delay-in-nuvia-processor-development.html">the chips are due in late 2023</a>. It might be a small thing, but Qualcomm executives said that the Oryon chips would ship in 2023, <em>sans</em> the &ldquo;late&rdquo; qualifier.</p>



<p>Qualcomm executives didn&rsquo;t address an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1063248/arm-qualcomm-suit-stresses-windows-on-arms-future.html">unexpected lawsuit by the company&rsquo;s IP provider, Arm</a> Ltd., against Qualcomm earlier this year. That would seem to put Qualcomm&rsquo;s development of its next-gen Nuvia / Oryon chips in jeopardy. Qualcomm executives didn&rsquo;t show any performance estimates of the new Oryon cores, and seemed reluctant to talk about them&mdash;perhaps restricted by Qualcomm&rsquo;s legal department.</p>



<h2 id="ai-powered-experiences-within-windows">AI-powered experiences within Windows</h2>



<p>In any event, Qualcomm executives seemed eager to emphasize the new &ldquo;experiences&rdquo; that come with Arm chips, powered by artificial intelligence. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379806/qualcomm-prioritizes-ai-in-snapdragon-8-gen-2-smartphone-chip.html">Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 smartphone chips</a> include a new &ldquo;Hexagon link&rdquo; that helps the Snapdragon accelerate AI functions, and the Snapdragon chips&rsquo; AI functions help power everything from improved photos to better connectivity.</p>



<p>On the PC, Snapdragon chips have struggled to keep up with X86 chips from AMD and Intel in terms of raw performance and compatibility. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357826/microsoft-surface-pro-9-5g-review-an-arm-tablet-worth-buying.html">We liked the recent Surface Pro 9 (5G)</a>, which features Qualcomm&rsquo;s co-designed Microsoft SQ3 chip, but buying a Windows on Arm PC has always come with an understanding: Stick close to the core group of Office/Microsoft 365 apps and Edge, and the device will do its best. (In the SP9 (5G)&rsquo;s case, we believe the performance on those apps is enough to recommend it.) But go too far afield into other, X86 apps, and the performance will suffer.</p>



<p>What the SQ3&rsquo;s AI processor can offer, however, is Windows Studio Effects, a set of AI-powered &ldquo;experiences&rdquo; that range from noise filtering to background blurring, plus an AI-powered technique where your eyes will appear to be always on the screen during video calls. Those effects require a dedicated AI core, which only Qualcomm can provide right now. (Intel&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1076150/intel-confirms-ai-improvements-will-come-in-meteor-lake.html">upcoming &ldquo;Meteor Lake&rdquo; chip</a> may close that AI gap, however.)  Adobe also announced a further collaboration with Qualcomm, to write more native Arm apps for its Creative Cloud suite.</p>



<p>The message? AI will overcome any shortcomings Qualcomm has in terms of CPU performance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our vision is to drive the convergence of mobile and PC, bringing the best of the smartphone to your laptop,&rdquo; said Kedar Kondap, senior vice president and general manager of Compute and Gaming at Qualcomm, in a statement.</p>



<p>Kondap brought Gerard Williams, senior vice president of engineering from Qualcomm, on stage with him at the Snapdragon Summit in Maui to talk about Oryon&mdash;a presentation that lasted about a minute. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Qualcomm Oryon Summary" class="wp-image-1382796" height="581" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Snapdragon-compute-summary.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>A summary of the Qualcomm Oryon announcement.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>&ldquo;Qualcomm Oryon is the first part of this journey, and the best-in-class CPU will revolutionize the industry with fast, powerful, and efficient performance for a new era of premium tier Windows PCs,&rdquo; Williams said. &ldquo;Even better, Qualcomm Oryon will play a key role in our one-technology roadmap and power Snapdragon across multiple platforms, and device categories. From mobile, to XR, to compute, and more. I cannot wait for you to experience this new technology, which is on target for customer delivery in 2023.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Williams then introduced a series of video endorsements from Asus, Acer, Lenovo, and Samsung&mdash;though whether those companies will ship PCs based upon Oryon, they didn&rsquo;t say. Guess we&rsquo;ll have to wait until 2023 to find out.</p>
