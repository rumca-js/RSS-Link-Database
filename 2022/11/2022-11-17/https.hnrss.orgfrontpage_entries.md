## Ask HN: What's a good business model for selling standalone software
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33645489](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33645489)

<p>Hello all!<p>We are selling standalone boring, mainly desktop (although it runs on beefier laptops as well) software. It's for Windows and written in boring technologies (C99 for the engine and C# for GUI).
We are considering various business models when it comes to selling it in the future as our current one causes a lot of problems. Some options and thoughts I have about them right now:<p>1)What I call a "classical model" which we tried so far: release 1.0 version, sell it for a fixed price. Continue to support it for a while with bugfixes/features. At some point move to developing 2.0 version, sell it again (giving discounts for current 1.0 customers).<p>Advantages: simple, the customers can use software they purchased forever<p>Disadvantages: at some point you need to start collecting features/development for the next version. This means you will not be shipping new things for a while and "sit" on developments in house. This creates numerous problems, the most severe are: I)you are releasing all the new things at once making the release period hell as all the bugs/suggestions/problems hit you at one point in time and II) you can't give customers what they want/need immediately even if they want to pay for it right now as you need a significant improvements for the next version. III) You don't get quick feedback from the customers (only from testers which will always be less complete) about the things you are working on. It may turn out you have spent a few months working on something people don't really want or they want it in a different way.<p>2)Pure subscription.<p>Advantages: I)Everyone is on the newest version all the time II)Everyone can cancel/renew at any point III)Incentives aligned: developers can ship new stuff immediately, no reason to sit on new developments<p>Disadvantages: you can't purchase software and "own it". I like the idea that software once purchased can be run in 3-5-10 years from now and it's not developers' business when/how you choose to run it.<p>3)Some mix of the above. For example one time purchase and then subscription for updates.<p>Potential problems:<p>I)Difficult to determine what happens to people who cancel subscription (do they get the latest version at the time - that's difficult to support, what they need to pay if they renew in a few months?)<p>II)What happens when someone want to jump from subscription to one-time payment + updates?<p>III)It's seems to be recipe for a situation where there are 100s of "current versions" people are running and that's very difficult to support. It would be nice if everyone is on a newest one (or some ancient one that doesn't need support anymore).<p>It seems like it's very difficult to choose a business model that let people "own" the software but which also keeps incentives for the developers to ship new developments regularly. I guess that can be worked around with frequent release schedule (so you don't sit on stuff for too long) but that's very difficult to accomplish in a small development team.<p>I also think in case of various subscription/subscription hybrid ideas it's very important to be very clear about the policy towards people who cancel/want to renew after some time.<p>Any advice/suggestions are much appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi HN! We’re Sanket and Pranav, co-founders of Dots (<a href="https://dots.community" rel="nofollow">https://dots.community</a>). We help people manage large communities on Discord by automating common tasks like onboarding new members and providing insights on your most valuable members.<p>Companies are increasingly interacting with their customers through communities on Slack and Discord. This trend will continue, because building a strong community around your product is a moat, leading to better retention and revenue. However, while Slack and Discord are great communication tools, they aren’t designed for community teams to engage with thousands of members at a personal level.  Moreover, community leaders don't have a good idea of who their members are. We solve these problems by letting them automate common tasks and by giving them visibility into what’s going on in their communities.<p>There’s a ton of repetitive manual work required to build a great community. Often, community leads spend hours kicking bots/toxic members or answering FAQs, ending in burnout. Specifically on Discord, mods of busy servers are patching together 10 bots or building custom bots to improve the UX of their server. This is confusing for community members too.<p>Dots is a no-code automation builder that helps mods build great experiences in their Discord servers. Specifically, the product consists of:<p>- <i>a no-code bot builder:</i> You can pick a trigger (e.g when a user joins a community, or when they click a button), and define various actions to fire off after (e.g. send a message, send a survey)  You can think about it like Typeform for Discord on steroids;<p>- <i>member analytics:</i>  Tag members into segments directly from Discord and identify key community members (or members about to churn)<p>Discord allows community leaders to build complex rules and member hierarchies. However, most mods lack the ability to code their own bots. A niche market of consultants and developers has cropped up to help customize communities, but our product lets the admins build what they need for themselves.<p>Here’s a quick 3 min demo on creating an automation flow: <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/67334ccee36f417da62caa2ad8fdcbd8" rel="nofollow">https://www.loom.com/share/67334ccee36f417da62caa2ad8fdcbd8</a><p>Communities like Chainlink, Splice, and the NBA use Dots to onboard and engage thousands of members in their servers. Here are some automation examples of what they use us for:<p>- <i>Welcome flows:</i> custom onboarding flows to ask questions to new members and show them around the community, as well as verify they’re not bots<p>- <i>Surveys:</i> send surveys to specific members within your Discord server<p>- <i>Support flow:</i> community-specific support chat bot directly in Discord which integrates with their existing support tooling<p>If you run a Discord, we would love love love your feedback! You can sign up here ( <a href="https://app.dots.community/signup" rel="nofollow">https://app.dots.community/signup</a> ) with no credit card required. Invite code is LAUNCHHN. We have a free tier and our paid pricing starts at $29 / month and up for more advanced features and very large communities.<p>Join our Discord to see a flow in action (or just hang out with other Discord mods): <a href="https://discord.gg/WJFTPtvGGw" rel="nofollow">https://discord.gg/WJFTPtvGGw</a>.<p>Thanks so much HN—we look forward to your comments and questions and any of your thoughts on software support for communities!</p>

<p>Hello HN!<p>I've been working on a task manager (<a href="https://plocs.com" rel="nofollow">https://plocs.com</a>) that combines a todo list with project management.<p>Unlike most task managers, Plocs supports task dependencies and makes working with them easy.<p>Thanks to dependencies Plocs is better in two important ways:<p>1.) You can plan in a goal-oriented way. Start with your goal and then plan the steps you need to get there.
2.) You can tell very easily which tasks you can work on: the ones that don't depend on other tasks are shown in a list to the left of the screen.<p>Would love to get your feedback!<p>PS: If you click on "Start demo" you can try it in the browser without registering.<p>Thanks,

<p>Does it exist a dedicated place where I can buy old 8-bit and 16-bit era computers and game consoles like C64, Amiga, Apple II, NES, etc, and periphery for them as old CRT monitors and floppy drives for example? eBay exists but there is a great chance the hardware from there is in not working condition. It will be great if there exists a dedicated store for such hardware.<p>And the second question is does exist a place where I can send such hardware for restoration? Like what can be watched on channels like "The 8bit Guy"[1] and "Adrian's Digital Basement"[2].<p>[1] https://www.youtube.com/@The8BitGuy

## Ask HN: We are sorry, but you do not have access to Gmail

<p>My vanity domain (¨Lastname¨.net) had its email hosted on gmail, for over 10 years with a lot of success.<p>Util I was forced to buy Workspace. Since that moment the message "We are sorry, but you do not have access to Gmail" shows with NO way to enable it.<p>I made the mistake of having this domain registration done with an email on this domain and have lost the password for the domain registar (NetSol).<p>So now I can not change the MX records (password reset only works with registered email) and I have try every single possibility to contact google: to no avail.<p>EVERYTHING I own (user accounts and the like) are now unavailable since I lost access to my email.<p>Is there any google whisperer who can help or tell me where I could find help?<p>I am desperate...</p>

## Ask HN: Good resource on writing web app with plain JavaScript/HTML/CSS

<p>Coming from WPF and Winform, I find web development to be unnecessarily complex, but I refuse to believe that’s true.<p>I just want to make a simple web app, no React, Angular or any of that. That can’t be too hard right? I’m sure in large scale, that stuff has its place, but I don’t need it. To me, the browser is the UI framework.<p>When I Google around to get started, I find obnoxious Medium articles. I don’t want to copy and paste instructions and throw something together without a clue what’s going on. Mozilla has good documentation, but I don’t know what’s a good source to actually get a web app running locally that I can eventually deploy online. Do I really need Node? Compared to WPF/Winform this is a mess, or so I hope not.</p>
