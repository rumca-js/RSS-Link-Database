Naturally, this iPad isn't quite as tricked out as Apple's higher-end models, but it's still a very capable device. It has an A13 Bionic chipset, instead of an Apple Silicon chip or the A14 one the company slotted into the 2022 iPad. The tablet has a 12MP ultra-wide selfie camera with support for Center Stage (a feature designed to keep you in the middle of the frame as you move around) and an 8MP wide-lens camera on the back. The device has Touch ID, stereo speakers and first-gen Apple Pencil support too. Apple claims that you'll be able to use this iPad for up to 10 hours on a single charge.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>We gave the 2021 iPad a score of 86 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-9th-generation-review-143045685.html\">in our review</a>, crediting it for improved performance from the 2020 model, larger base storage capacity, a better front-facing camera and solid battery life. The screen doesn't quite match up to the ones found in other iPads, though, and the design feels a bit outdated. If you can live with those downsides, however, you'll be getting a great tablet at a hard-to-beat price.</p><p>As for the 2022 iPad, that's on sale too. Along with the A14 chip, landscape-oriented front-facing camera and USB-C charging port, the more recent model boasts an iPad Air-esque redesign (the Home button is no more, for one thing). <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-10th-generation-review-160014897.html\">We gave it a score of 85</a>, citing drawbacks like having to use a dongle to charge the first-gen Apple Pencil.

Powering it is Apple\u2019s updated M2 chip \u2014 the same silicon inside the latest <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-review-2022-130040098.html\">MacBook Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-13-inch-review-m2-2022-130005000.html\">13-inch MacBook Pro</a>. The new chip makes the tablet a bit zippier than the last model, powering through heavy multitasking, media editing and the most demanding games.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The 2022 iPad Pro also adds a new hover feature that lets you hold the second-gen Apple Pencil over the screen to preview inputs and effects. Although that alone isn\u2019t reason enough to upgrade, it\u2019s a fun detail that could become integral as software developers tailor their apps for it. The high-end tablet also supports WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 networking.</p><p>If you own the 2021 iPad Pro, this probably isn\u2019t the generation to upgrade. The M2 chip and hover feature are welcome additions, but everything else is unchanged from last year\u2019s model. That includes the screen, chassis, cameras and battery \u2014 it\u2019s a minor update to a tablet that was already overkill for most people\u2019s iPad workflows.</p><p>Still, this model is the company\u2019s best 11-inch model and an impressive hybrid device when you add the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-magic-keyboard-review-ipad-pro-299-349-130015291.html\">Magic Keyboard</a>. In addition, the M2 chip runs smoothly with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/i-pad-os-16-stage-manager-collaboration-gaming-184313792.html\">Stage Manager</a>, Apple\u2019s answer to persistent criticisms about iPadOS software not keeping up with cutting-edge iPad hardware. Stage Manager lets you keep up to four apps open in a single group with resizable, overlapping windows. Although the multitasking feature still feels like a work in progress, we expect Apple to keep tweaking and refining it in future software updates.</p><p>If you consider upgrading to this model from an older iPad Pro, this will also be your introduction to Center Stage. The feature uses machine learning to track your (and others\u2019) faces during a video call in apps like FaceTime and Zoom. The frame follows you if you move to the side or go from sitting to standing. And if someone else enters the frame, it also pans out to bring them into the shot.</p><p>Should you prefer a bigger screen, Amazon also has the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJKTEQ0U1dEP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tNjctMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjBmMjRlZjQ0LWM0YzYtNDhkOC1hNTYzLWZlMDExNGU3OThmZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZPzUCXGlxSLehL4LQc9T6-FWSVeixqTLeysa5dLMuyg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLD4SWD%3Fth%3D1\">12.9-inch model</a> for $1,069, which is $30 off what you\u2019d pay at Apple.

You can pull the same optical trick with the \"Map of Sanctuary,\" though its real purpose is for wrapping the charger and cable \u2014 a handy bundle for travelling. The phone, case and pin are tucked inside a blood red \"Worldstone\" phone box, which is itself packaged alongside the map in a larger \"Horadric Cube\" box. Alas, much like the original ROG Phone 6, the Peltier-powered AeroActive Cooler 6 isn't included here \u2014 it'll cost you an extra $100.</p><p>The ROG Phone 6 Diablo Immortal Edition will be available on ASUS' online store from November 18, though it'll cost you $1,299 \u2014 that's $200 more than the regular version.

To that end, we\u2019ve updated our guide with all the latest models designed for every vlogger from novice to professional, in all price ranges. Engadget has tested all of these to give you recommendations for the best vlogging cameras, and we\u2019ll even discuss a few rumored upcoming models.</p><p>One caveat to this year\u2019s best camera guide is that a parts shortage has limited production of many cameras, causing shortages and higher prices. Sony, for one, halted production of the aforementioned ZV-E10 for a time, and models from Fujifilm and others are also hard to find. The good news is that the shortage appears to be easing, so hopefully we\u2019ll see normal supply levels in the near future.&nbsp;</p><h2>What do you need in a vlogging camera?</h2><p>Vlogging cameras are designed for filmmakers who often work alone and either use a tripod, gimbal, vehicle mount or just their hands to hold a camera. It has to be good not just for filming yourself, but other \u201cB-roll\u201d footage that helps tell your story.</p><p>The number one requirement is a flip-around screen so you can see yourself while filming. Those can rotate up, down or to the side, but flipping out to the side is preferable so a tripod or microphone won\u2019t block it.</p><figure><img alt=\"How to buy a vlogging camera in 2020\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/1a18e473-e853-11ea-affe-23c2897a4cda\" /><figcaption>Steve Dent/Engadget \n   </figcaption></figure><p>Continuous autofocus (AF) for video with face and eye detection is also a must. It becomes your camera \u201cassistant,\u201d keeping things in focus while you concentrate on your content. Most cameras can do that nowadays, but some still do it better than others.</p><p>If you move around or walk a lot, you should look for an action camera with built-in optical stabilization. Electronic stabilization is another option as long as you\u2019re aware of the limitations. You\u2019ll also need a camera with a fast sensor that limits rolling shutter, which can create a distracting jello \u201cwobble\u201d with quick camera movements.</p><p>4K recording is another key feature for video quality. All cameras nowadays can shoot 4K up to at least 24 fps, but if possible, it\u2019s better to have 4K video recording at 60 or even 120 fps. If you shoot sports or other things involving fast movement, look for a model with at least 1080p at 120 fps for slow-motion recording.</p><p>Video quality is another important consideration, especially for skin tones. Good light sensitivity helps for night shooting, concerts, etcetera, and a log profile helps improve dynamic range in very bright or dark shooting conditions. If you want the best possible image quality and can afford it, get a camera that can record 4K with 10-bits (billions) of colors. That will give you more options when you go to edit your vlog.</p><p>Don\u2019t neglect audio either \u2014 if the quality is bad, your audience will disengage. Look for a camera with an external microphone port so you can plug in a shotgun or lapel mic for interviews, or at least one with a good-quality built-in microphone. It\u2019s also nice to have a headphone port to monitor sound so you can avoid nasty surprises after you\u2019ve finished shooting.</p><p>You\u2019ll also want good battery life and, if possible, dual memory card slots for a backup. Finally, don\u2019t forget about your camera\u2019s size and weight. If you\u2019re constantly carrying one while shooting, especially at the end of a gimbal or gorillapod, it might actually be <em>the</em> most important factor. That\u2019s why tiny GoPro cameras are so popular for sports, despite offering lower image quality and fewer pro features.</p><h2>The best action and portable cameras</h2><p>If you\u2019re just starting out in vlogging or need a small, rugged camera, an action cam might be your best bet. In general, they\u2019re easy to use as you don\u2019t have to worry about things like exposure or focus. Recent models also offer good electronic stabilization and sharp, colorful video at up to 4K and 60 fps. The downsides are a lack of control; image quality that\u2019s not on par with larger cameras; and no zooming or option to change lenses.</p><h3>DJI Pocket II</h3><figure><img alt=\"DJI Pocket 2\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/86787d80-1227-11eb-a75a-280f47d47105\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">DJI</div></figure><p>Last time around we recommended the original Osmo Pocket, but the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3NnypVC\">Pocket II</a> (no more \u201cOsmo\u201d) has some big improvements. As before, it\u2019s mounted on a three-axis gimbal and has impressive face tracking that keeps your subject locked in focus while video recording. However, the new model has a larger, much higher resolution 64-megapixel sensor, a faster lens with a wider field of view and improved microphones. As before, you can get accessories like an extension rod, a waterproof case and more.</p><p>What really makes the Pocket II great for vlogging are the follow modes combined with face tracking. If you\u2019re working solo, you can simply set it up and it\u2019ll rotate and tilt to follow you around. That also applies for walk-and-talk vlogging, so you don\u2019t have to worry about focus or even pointing the camera at yourself. For $346, it\u2019s not only good for beginners, but is a handy tool for any vlogger.</p><a class=\"athena-button\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3NnypVC\" id=\"82ff3565622340d3b2d593fae475033e\">Buy DJI Pocket II at Amazon - $349</a><h3>GoPro Hero10 Black</h3><figure><img alt=\"The GoPro Hero 10 Black is $100 off at Amazon\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fc4978c0-5f3d-11ec-abab-8685891b375c\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3wvCfq0\">Hero10 Black</a> is what we called a \u201cbig, invisible upgrade\u201d over the Hero9, itself a much improved camera over the Hero8 Black we recommended last time. That\u2019s largely due to the new processor that unlocks features like higher-resolution 5.3K 60p and 4K 120fps video, much improved Hypersmooth 4.0 stabilization, an improved front-screen and more. All of that makes the GoPro Hero10 Black ideal to mount on a drone, vehicle, helmet, bicycle and more, at a very manageable $350 price with a <a href=\"https://fave.co/3ClOJjY\">1-year GoPro subscription</a>.</p><a class=\"athena-button\" href=\"https://fave.co/3ClOJjY\" id=\"01edc2691fac44e1b4c6acd3a879b21e\">Buy Hero 10 Black bundle at GoPro - $350</a><h3>DJI Action 2</h3><figure><img alt=\"Someone holds up the new DJI Action 2 camera against a dingy monotone background.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/adc3e7c0-373e-11ec-9efe-1b013bd737bd\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">DJI</div></figure><p>DJI took a much different approach compared to GoPro with its latest <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3LBpXAG\">Action 2 camera</a> \u2013 no with more Osmo branding.

The coolest feature is the Nokia OZO system that can isolate audio to a specific person via face-detection tracking \u2014 something that can theoretically improve audio quality.

It has an APS-C sensor and all-new RF-S lenses, meaning that it might replace Canon\u2019s current M-series cameras.

All of that will make it a top vlogging option, if our upcoming review confirms the hype.</p><p>On top of that, Canon also announced a cheaper EOS R10 model with a 24.2-megapixel sensor that could also be an ideal vlogging camera. Both cameras are coming out towards the end of 2022.</p><p>In addition, Fujifilm <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-x-h-2-s-camera-6-2-k-video-40-fps-bursts-140020910.html\">just launched the X-H2S</a>, its new $2,500 flagship mirrorless camera. With a 26.2-megapixel stacked and backside-illuminated sensor, it offers a raft of impressive features. Some of the highlights include 40 fps blackout-free burst shooting, faster autofocus, 6.2K 30fps video, a flip-out display and 7-stop in-body stabilization.

When it was released in 1970 it was considered the first \"portable\" synth and it was among the first to distill the core tenants of what we consider modern synthesis into a self-contained, pre-wired package.

While it retains the original's sound and feel, it does include a number of modern amenities that debuted on the 2016 version, like an analog LFO with triangle and square eaves; an improved Fatar Keybed with aftertouch and velocity sensitivity; and MIDI integration. The new version also adds a spring-loaded pitch wheel that snaps back to the center on release \u2014 which it pretty much how pitch wheels work on every other synth.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"8c8d57626d6a4091bb23be25e7295abc\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>You still get the same massive three-oscillator monophonic sound and iconic ladder filter.

Hopefully this batch will last a little longer on the market. But there is some bad news \u2014 the price has gone up. A lot. While the last run of Model Ds would have set you back $3,749, the newest is going for $4,999. It's not cheap \u2014 but at least it's less expensive than a vintage version.

And with the Assure Lock 2, Yale's latest smart deadbolt is easy to install, it's simple to use and it works with all the major smart home platforms (including the recently finalized <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/matter-smart-home-standard-released-160059101.html\">Matter protocol</a>). Also, because the device is available in a wide range of finishes and configs, there's a good chance it'll fight right in with your home's design. In a lot of ways, it's the do-everything smart lock.</p><h2>The basics</h2><p>The Assure Lock 2 is available in three finishes (black suede, bronze and satin nickel) across four basic configurations: a $160 keypad version with physical buttons that can be specced both with and without a physical keyhole and a slightly more sophisticated $180 touchscreen model, which once again supports both keyed and key-free setups. By default, the lock features Bluetooth connectivity, but for people who want deeper integration with smart home ecosystems, Yale sells modules that can add support for WiFi, ZigBee and Matter. (Note: There are also versions of the lock that come with the WiFi module pre-installed starting at $240. However, while Yale says the Assure Lock 2 is fully compatible with the Matter standard, its Matter modules aren't expected to be available until early 2023).</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>For the purposes of this review, I'll be focusing on the keypad model with WiFi and a dedicated keyway, as it offers the best combo of traditional convenience and new school smarts.</p><h2>Setup and installation</h2><figure><img alt=\"Yale's Assure Lock 2 comes with almost everything you need to install it including a range of screws designed to fit doors of different sizes and four AA batteries. The only thing you need to provide yourself is a Phillips head screwdriver.  \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/ee99f2f0-65c6-11ed-b5ff-6edafcf81062\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>I admit the idea of installing a deadbolt might sound a bit intimidating for some, but there's really not much to be concerned about. Yale says the Assure Lock 2 is designed to work with most doors used in the U.S. and Canada, with support for boreholes up to 2 \u00be-inches in diameter on slabs up to 1 \u00be-inches thick. The only tool you need is a Phillips head screwdriver, so even mildly handly city folk like myself had no trouble screwing everything down in under 30 minutes. And that includes a small bit of troubleshooting I had to do with customer service.</p><p>The first step is removing your old deadbolt. After that, you can use the included installation manual or download the Yale Access app (you\u2019ll need it later anyways) which features a really thorough step-by-step guide, complete with videos and visual aids. The box also includes a paper template to help you figure out the size of your door, which is important because there are a few packs of different-sized screws you'll need to use depending on its specific dimensions.</p><p>Once the deadbolt is installed, the next thing you need to do is mount the DoorSense module, which is what allows the Assure Lock 2 to figure out when your door is open or closed. You can choose to stick it on the door frame near the lock, which just requires a couple of included screws and some pre-installed double-sided tape. Or you can go for a more seamless installation by hiding the sensor inside the frame of the door. But you\u2019ll need a \u215d-inch drill bit for that so you can hollow out a hole for the DoorSense's magnet.</p><figure><img alt=\"While the Assure Lock 2 comes with a physical manual, there's also a step-by-step installation guide with images and videos in the Yale Access app. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/70b52390-65c7-11ed-adfd-f4d823334513\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>The one part where the device got tripped up was during calibration, which is when the lock attempts to latch and unlatch itself in order to figure out when the door is properly secured. Unfortunately, even though my previous deadbolt was a WiFi Smart Lock from August (which like Yale is owned by Assa Abloy), the depth of my latch was a bit too shallow, preventing the lock from extending all the way. However, after calling Yale's customer support, a friendly agent named Victor had me email a picture of my lock, which helped us sort out the issue. And after digging out the cavity for the latch a bit more, everything worked perfectly.</p><h2>In use</h2><p>Once you get everything up and running, the Assure Lock 2 really shines. It's like a Ronco rotisserie oven, you <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLq27iOW0R0\">just set it and forget it.</a> You can assign multiple entry codes and invite guests as needed via the Yale Access app. If someone uses the PIN you assigned them, the app records a log of when they entered. However, if you use the auto-unlock feature, you may never need to use the keypad at all. That\u2019s because anytime you go more than 200 meters away from home, it uses Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to determine when you are coming back so it can unlock automatically as you walk up. And even though on Android devices you get a warning that the auto-unlock feature may be a little slow on certain devices, I never had any issues when using either a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 or Google Pixel 6.</p><figure><img alt=\"The key cylinder on the Assure Lock 2 is designed to fit doors with boreholes up to 2.75-inches in diameter. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/ad48f390-65c7-11ed-ba39-dea468402c86\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>When you're leaving, you can simply press the Yale logo to lock your door. Or you can be even lazier and enable the auto-locking feature. I have mine set to a latch a minute and a half after the door is closed, which is just enough for me to leave, walk to the trash chute in my building and get back before the deadbolt re-engages, but not so long that someone could feasibly sneak in behind me without being spotted. And because the deadbolt also supports voice assistant integration, you can unlock your door just by asking Google, Alexa or Siri. (For those worried about voice controls being a security issue, the system makes sure to ask for a PIN when using spoken commands. So don\u2019t use them if someone you don\u2019t trust is around.),</p><p>The unlocking options don't stop there though, because for those with Apple Watches, you can simply move your wrist near the lock and use Bluetooth to let you in. And as always, you can simply open the app if you prefer a more manual approach. Most importantly none of these options failed me even once during testing. So you may never need to use a physical key again unless you really want to (though, I still like having one as a backup in case of emergency).</p><figure><img alt=\"While it's not that hard, possibly the trickiest thing about installing the Assure Lock 2 is attaching the wire that connects the rear housing to the keypad or touchscreen. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/d9681e10-65c7-11ed-8fbd-e121e6c5b52e\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Another bonus of the Assure Lock 2's new design, is that now it\u2019s around 30 percent smaller than before. And when compared to something like August\u2019s locks, it also sports a more traditional, so you don\u2019t have to explain how to unlock the door visitors want to leave (which happens a lot more often than you might imagine). However, the downside is that because you're replacing the entire deadbolt instead of adding a device on top of your existing hardware like with some of Yale's rivals, the Assure Lock 2 might not be a great option for renters or people with strict HOAs.</p><p>Also, while I didn\u2019t do this myself, if you want to upgrade to a new lock but really don\u2019t want to change out all your keys, Yale even offers a service called Keyed Alike. For a small fee ($4), you can send Yale the code for you current lock\u2019s cylinder and when your new deadbolt arrives, it will work with your existing set of keys.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><p>Yale says the Assure Lock 2 with WiFi's battery life is around three months, depending on how often you're coming and going. And while I was initially a bit disappointed that the lock relies on four disposable AA batteries, Yale says that due to fire safety regulations, the company isn't allowed to use rechargeable cells. You can put your own rechargeables in if you really want, but if anything goes wrong, that's on you. Oh, and for anyone who goes with a keyless model, in the event that the lock's batteries die while you're out, you can tap a 9-volt battery on the contacts on the underside of the housing, which gives the lock just enough juice to let you in.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt=\"Unlike some other add-on smart locks, the Assure Lock 2 features a more traditional design with a simple battery housing that requires four AA batteries. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/1424bd10-65c8-11ed-9e65-5d9cb2b5b8ae\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>With the Assure Lock 2, Yale has created a smart deadbolt that really covers all the bases. You get four different configs in a variety of finishes. And thanks to compatibility with a wide range of standard door sizes, there's a high chance it'll fit right in on your home. So while other smart locks offer similar features like auto-unlock and the ability to detect when your door is ajar, they often don't provide the flexibility of both keyed and keyless options while also lacking support for all the major smart home protocols (WiFi, Zigbee and Matter). But my favorite thing about the lock is that it accomplishes what every really great smart home device should do: it gets out of your way. Once it's installed and configured how you like, you don\u2019t really have to worry about it again. The Assure Lock 2 makes it easier to track and control who's going in and out of your house and if you're looking at getting a new smart lock, this one needs to be at the top of your list.</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-early-black-friday-sale-154917367.html?src=rss", "title": "Amazon's Echo Show displays all return to lowest prices in early Black Friday sale", "date_published": "2022-11-17 15:49:17+00:00", "description": "<p>Amazon has kicked off another <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kZWFsLzk1NmEyYzY1P3Nob3dWYXJpYXRpb25zPXRydWUmcmVmPWRseF8xMTg1MV9nZF9kY2xfaW1nXzFfOTU2YTJjNjVfZHRfbWVzZTRfY2YmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tNjAtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU5Y2Y1NzRiLTA2ZTktNDk4Zi1hZTg3LTExMTIzMTc1NzczOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdQaX6RY6nMYc-_b1iUVWFJkpPPiCZmQAnLCFTJJp_fz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdeal%2F956a2c65%3FshowVariations%3Dtrue%26ref%3Ddlx_11851_gd_dcl_img_1_956a2c65_dt_mese4_cf\">sale on its Echo Show smart devices</a> ahead of Black Friday.

The machine\u2019s sensors identify when it\u2019s rolling over hardwood versus a carpet, and flips down the pad accordingly. It\u2019s a fairly smart piece of engineering, and iRobot\u2019s engineers deserve kudos for finding such an elegant solution. All you\u2019ll need to do is fill the reservoir with water and some cleaning solution, and activate a mission from inside the iRobot app, choosing your dosage level (Eco, Standard or Ultra) before pressing start.</p><p>I\u2019ve had the J7+ in my home for three weeks now, set up in my entrance hall, since the ground floor of my home is a mix of hardwood, laminate and rugs. My kids, who have to walk down a dirt track to get to school, love tracking mud and debris into my hallway upon their return. Plus, it means I can send it out after dinner to clean the kitchen floor to deal with the usual raft of child-created crumbs. Although more commonly, I choose to clean the floors during the mid-morning, when my kids can\u2019t complain about the noise the Clean Base makes.</p><figure><img alt=\"Image of the Roomba Combo J7+ on my office carpet\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/03df87d0-65cf-11ed-bfff-86742f389fa3\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>The J7+ is the first Roomba to ship with iRobot OS 5.0, which improves upon the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/irobots-pet-poop-detecting-roomba-j7-plus-vacuum-is-200-off-right-now-130004421.html\">company\u2019s work to avoid dangerous hazards</a>. (I don\u2019t know if I can say \u201crolling into a pile of dog poop and smearing it all over your carpets\u201d in a way that\u2019s brand safe, so just use your own euphemism.) After each mission, you\u2019ll be asked to review obstacles that the robot detected during the trip, letting it know if the pair of sneakers you left by the back door is a temporary or permanent fixture for the future. The big point, however, is for the camera\u2019s computer vision to identify these hazards and avoid them without having to bump into them.</p><p>I will say, I did find the <em>early</em> mapping runs to be a little more frustrating than I may have expected. Part of this was because I had to tidy up everything after my kids before I could send the machine out for a run. And that it was outfoxed fairly regularly by both my welcome mat and the threshold between the hallway and the kitchen. I wish, really, there was a way I could use my phone \u2013 with its boat-load of location-aware tech \u2013 to help build the map. For instance, I\u2019d be happy to trace a rough outline of the ground floor of my home with my phone using dead reckoning, which you\u2019d think would help speed up the process.</p><p>To be fair, this power has grown exponentially over the period of time I\u2019ve had the Roomba in my home. A few days ago, the system asked if I wanted to craft a dedicated cleaning zone around the kitchen table, without any prompting from me whatsoever. That\u2019s obviously a great way to spot-target areas of dirt buildup without having to do the whole kitchen floor every night, too. Credit where due, the Roomba has picked up a good sense of where everything is in my house, and where it needs to direct its energies.</p><p>The machine does a great job removing small, loose particles from the floor, but it\u2019s still leaving the odd outlier. Not to mention that, despite a lot of promises to not need much micromanagement, you\u2019ll be filling the Roomba\u2019s water reservoir very frequently. The container can take a fairly piddly 210 ml (around 7 ounces) of water, good enough for 40 square meters (430 square feet) of floor on high dose, enough just about for my modest, British ground floor. But if you\u2019re in a McMansion with floors the length and breadth of a football field, you might need to refill the Roomba in the middle of a job.</p><p>In the US, the J7+ ships with the clean base, which will set you back $1,099.99 \u2013 a fairly massive chunk of change. Elsewhere, you can pick it up base-free, but if you\u2019re buying a Roomba for the convenience, the base makes plenty of sense. The base is not only where your machine will charge itself, but it has its own vacuum that sucks out any debris that the Roomba picks up and deposits it inside its own bag. If I have a complaint, it\u2019s that I wish the Roomba itself had some of the power of the Clean Base\u2019s own suction, which is about as powerful (and noisy) as a jet engine. I also wish there was a way to disable this feature.</p><p>There are parts of iRobot\u2019s sales pitch that leave me almost petulantly shrugging in hostile indifference. Like being able to order your Roomba to clean a specific high-traffic zone by barking a command to your home\u2019s voice assistant of choice. I think using a voice assistant became pass\u00e9 after the third time you tried to impress your neighbors by changing the color of your living room lights in 2013. Yes, for older people, and those with accessibility needs, a good voice assistant connection is vital, but it\u2019s also something that leaves me cold. Especially when it\u2019s a lot easier to just activate a mission from the app, which is beautifully simple to do.</p><p>But, despite my objections, I have found this gizmo worming its way into my regular routine more than I ever expected. It\u2019s actually a pleasure to walk back from the school run, see a pile of dirt on the floor and be able to magic it away with the press of a button. And setting it up to mop the floor as well, means that the number times I have to clean it myself has dropped massively. It may not replace your vacuum cleaner, or your mop, but it will mean you don\u2019t have to use them anywhere near as frequently as you normally do.</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-3rd-generation-amazon-sale-144550778.html?src=rss", "title": "Apple's third-generation AirPods fall to a new low of $140 ahead of Black Friday", "date_published": "2022-11-17 14:45:50+00:00", "description": "<p>Apple's sweet-spot earbuds are now at their best price to date.

The new design makes them even more comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and they have noticeably better active noise cancellation as well. Now, the ANC in the XM4 was already stellar, so Sony just took it up a notch with the XM5 by adding a separate V1 chip to accompany the QN1 chip that was the star of the show in the XM4. In addition to that, the XM5 have a total of eight ANC mics, double the number in the XM4, and all of that adds up to a system that does a fantastic job of blocking out all kinds of noise.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Aside from that, the XM5 have all of the same features that the XM4 had: good sound quality, solid touch controls, multi-device connectivity, Speak-to-Chat and a 30-hour battery life. It's not surprising that they topped our list of best wireless headphones, nudging its predecessor off the list, so it's also not surprising that you'll have to pay a premium for them. We don't expect them to drop much lower than $348, so this is a good deal that you can get even before Black Friday proper. However, if you're willing to skip the enhancements in the XM5, the XM4 are still really great headphones that are made much better by this Black Friday sale price of $228.</p><p>If you're sticking to a strict budget this holiday season, Sony's WH-CH710N headphones are a steal at $68. They don't have as slick of a design as the XM5 (or the XM4, really), but they are comfortable and have decent ANC. We also like their 35-hour battery life, plus the fact that you can take calls hands-free if you link the headphones up with your phone's virtual assistant. As for the LinkBuds S, they are some of Sony's newest wireless earbuds and their key feature is smart playback. The buds will automatically play and pause music depending on your activity, plus they support ANC and high-resolution audio.</p><a class=\"athena-button rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb255LU5vaXNlLUNhbmNlbGxpbmctSGVhZHBob25lcy1XSENINzEwTi9kcC9CMDg1UlFZWDVaP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTV4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhZDVjYTQ0Zi0zZTM4LTQ0M2YtYjBiYi1kMGQwNDg2NmQzNDAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfbnjIHl9qBAISwkstG8uNVY3R8l2Axv5A4-4kRc_9fA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WHCH710N%2Fdp%2FB085RQYX5Z\" id=\"57b7c437e9774c65acf206488f4c8721\">Buy Sony WH-CH710N at Amazon - $68</a><a class=\"athena-button rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb255LUNhbmNlbGluZy1IZWFkcGhvbmVzLUJsdWV0b290aC1Db21wYXRpYmxlL2RwL0IwQkI1VkJGUkY_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tNXgtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFkNWNhNDRmLTNlMzgtNDQzZi1iMGJiLWQwZDA0ODY2ZDM0MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdQRT8VTYMoA7wpAEVkoK6nGfBaRXzk_9U0TxcfAMH0t&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-Canceling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB0BB5VBFRF%3F\" id=\"717d1f6a4feb46099040e4752abe568b\">Buy Sony LinkBuds S at Amazon - $128</a><a class=\"athena-button rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9zdG9yZXMvcGFnZS9BQTkzMDdBQS03NTYyLTQ0QTMtQjQ3RC1CNzBDMDQ5OUY5MUE_aW5ncmVzcz0yJnZpc2l0SWQ9N2U5ZjVmMDQtYjUwYi00MDAwLWJmYTEtODQyZTdlZWFmMmYwJnJlZl89YXN0X2JsbiZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby01eC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ1Y2E0NGYtM2UzOC00NDNmLWIwYmItZDBkMDQ4NjZkMzQwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYavy6dMTkE1mqCldbGXf661aYDPtHNX_UEpZvmh3Zqt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2FAA9307AA-7562-44A3-B47D-B70C0499F91A%3Fingress%3D2%26visitId%3D7e9f5f04-b50b-4000-bfa1-842e7eeaf2f0%26ref_%3Dast_bln\" id=\"857baf3c8d604ff6bef8edaca5580b0f\">Shop Sony Black Friday deals at Amazon</a><p><em>Get the latest </em><a href=\"https://engadget.com/black-friday/\"><em>Black Friday</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cyber-monday/\"><em>Cyber Monday</em></a><em> offers by following </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribing to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em>.</em></p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-gifts-for-music-lovers-and-musicians-141559079.html?src=rss", "title": "The best holiday gifts for music lovers and musicians in 2022", "date_published": "2022-11-17 14:15:59+00:00", "description": "<p>Everyone needs a hobby, right?

With the Ether your sound-loving giftee can eavesdrop on neon signs and sample the silent whine of an AC adapter. It\u2019s literally a gateway to an invisible world of electromagnetic waves.

It\u2019s capable of getting that classic Moog sound with thick square and saw waves shaped by resonant lowpass filter.

If you'll recall, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/space-x-reportedly-fired-employees-that-wrote-letter-criticizing-elon-musk-075046446.html\"><em>The Times reported</em></a> back in June that SpaceX fired employees involved in writing an open letter condemning Elon Musk's \"harmful Twitter behavior.\" In particular, they were referencing how the CEO made crude <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1527757119239380993\">jokes on Twitter</a> about a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-spacex-sexual-miisconduct-230458875.html\">sexual misconduct accusation</a> against him by a flight attendant for the company's corporate jet. SpaceX paid $250,000 to settle with the flight attendant, who claimed that Musk offered to buy her a horse in exchange for sex acts.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, nine workers lost their jobs over the letter, and the charges were filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for eight of them. \"Elon's behavior in the public sphere is a frequent source of distraction and embarrassment for us,\" part of the letter read. The people who penned the letter also included proposals on how to make the company better and how to strengthen its sexual harassment policies, including the suggestion that SpaceX should disclose any other harassment claims against Musk.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>SpaceX executives were reportedly sympathetic in the beginning and seemed like they were receptive to the ideas the workers included in the proposals. However, they quickly changed their tune. SpaceX president and COO Gwynne Shotwell told employees in a letter back then that some employees involved in writing the letter had indeed been terminated. \"The letter, solicitations and general process made employees feel uncomfortable, intimidated and bullied, and/or angry because the letter pressured them to sign onto something that did not reflect their views,\" she added.&nbsp;</p><p>The legal experts <em>The Times</em> consulted said the workers are most likely protected under the <a href=\"https://www.nlrb.gov/guidance/key-reference-materials/national-labor-relations-act\">National Labor Relations Act</a>, which gives them the right to self-organize and band together for collective bargaining or other \"mutual aid or protection.\" Wilma Liebman, the former NLRB chairperson under Barack Obama, told the publication that SpaceX could argue that the workers penned the letter only to criticize Musk, which isn't protected by the law. However, she said that the board would probably disagree and would see Musk's tweets as an act that creates a hostile work environment.</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/lyft-and-motional-are-launching-a-driverless-ride-service-in-los-angeles-130004340.html?src=rss", "title": "Lyft and Motional to offer driverless taxi rides in Los Angeles", "date_published": "2022-11-17 13:00:04+00:00", "description": "<p>Lyft and Motional have announced plans to launch a driverless ride-hailing service in Los Angeles using Ioniq 5 EV Level 4 robotaxis.

The company designed the 2023 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-28-toyota-2019-prius-electric-all-wheel-drive.html\">Prius</a>, which will come in LE, XLE and Limited grades, with a low center of gravity, a wider stance and a lower driving position. Its roofline is 2 inches lower than its predecessor's, and it is one inch wider at the rear. Toyota was clearly going for a more sporty, modern look, aided by the larger wheels in the XLE and Limited variants.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, the new Prius comes with performance improvements, as well. It uses Toyota's 5th generation hybrid powertrain and a new lithium-ion battery, which offers a 15 percent increase in output compared to the lineup's old nickel metal battery technology. That means the company was able to develop a smaller and lighter battery for the vehicle without compromising its performance. But since Prius is still a hybrid and doesn't solely rely on electricity for power, Toyota has also equipped it with a bigger two-liter gas engine.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The automaker says the Front-Wheel Drive variants have a 194 horsepower output and can go from 0 to 60 mph within 7.2 seconds, faster than the outgoing FWD vehicles' 9.8 seconds. The All-Wheel Drive models have a 196 horsepower output and the capability to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 7 seconds. All models have three drive modes: Eco, which enhances fuel economy, and Power and Sport modes, which increase throttle responsiveness.&nbsp;</p><p>Other features include half a dozen USB-C ports and the Toyota Audio Multimedia system with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-next-car-play-will-meld-itself-to-your-car-infotainment-system-174750787.html\">Apple CarPlay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/android-auto-is-getting-a-major-ui-update-google-io-2022-160002501.html\">Android Auto</a> compatibility. Toyota's Connected Service Drive Connect also gives owners access to an intelligent assistant that can follow voice activated commands and cloud navigation, which can download the latest available map, traffic and routing information from the cloud. And in case drivers are truly having a tough time finding the way to their next destination, they can also use the Destination Assist feature to talk to a live agent any time of day</p><p>For driver assistance, the vehicle has Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Cross Traffic Alert, as well as Front and Rear Parking Assist with Automatic Braking on all variants. The Limited version has a Panoramic View Monitor that provides a live rotating 360-degree view around the vehicle and a hands-free system that can help drivers with parallel parking or backing into a parking space.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the 2023 Prius will come with the latest version of Toyota's Safety Sense generation, which enables a pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, lane departure alert with steering assist and cruise control. A new addition to the feature and to Prius as a whole is proactive driving assist that enables gentle braking into curves or when it senses a vehicle, pedestrian or cyclist ahead of the vehicle.&nbsp;</p><p>Toyota has yet to reveal the pricing and availability of the 2023 Prius, but it promises to make another announcement with those details before the year ends.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"Toyota\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/48b4e4d0-6643-11ed-a503-7635efe10f19\" style=\"height: 1013; width: 1920;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Toyota</div></figure><p></p>", "favourite": false}]
