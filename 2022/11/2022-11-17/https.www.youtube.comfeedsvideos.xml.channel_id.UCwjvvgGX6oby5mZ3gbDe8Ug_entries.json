At 20:00, a transformer on the side of the road at this station caught fire and made explosive noises. \nOne day before the fire at Nanchang West Station, on November 11th, 2022, an explosion occurred in two subway cars on Shanghai Metro Line 11. From the video, you can see the trains emitting sparks, smoke, and a loud explosion. The accident happened in the morning, during work hours.\nThe timing of the two incidents is so close that it has sparked heated discussion among the Chinese at home and abroad. Is it possible that the strict preventive controls in mainland China have been in place for too long and that the lack of maintenance of the high-speed rail and subway systems has led to these incidents?\n\nHave questions?
