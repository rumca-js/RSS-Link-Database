But the huge structural advantages of being the opposition party in a midterm election, along with some help from gerrymandered redistricting plans blessed by the Republican-majority US supreme court, pushed the Republicans over the top.

Ballerina who played a Juliet of ‘genuine power’ opposite Nureyev’s Romeo in his 1977 production for London Festival Ballet<p>The dancer Patricia Ruanne, who has died aged 77, was one of a select group of friends who worked long hours with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-rudolf-nureyev-1477015.html" title="">Rudolf Nureyev</a> to create his production of Romeo and Juliet for London Festival Ballet’s contribution to the Queen’s silver jubilee celebration in 1977. Nureyev’s ballet was faithful to Shakespeare’s play, and he knew his Juliet needed to be strongly motivated.</p><p>The critic Alexander Bland said after the first night: “Patricia Ruanne acted Juliet with a genuine power, as a strong positive girl for whom luck runs out, and tackled the difficult dancing without faltering.” Richard Davies noted that “this Juliet … with her high forehead and cheekbones, has stepped straight out of the Renaissance”. Ruanne’s career was not defined by just one role, but her Juliet reflected her ability as both a dance-actor and a ballerina.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/nov/17/patricia-ruanne-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Motorpoint Arena, Nottingham<br /></strong>There’s swagger in his wardrobe, and a few ageless classics delivered with gusto, but there’s a lot here showing its age</p><p>Opening a set with a cover is an unusual choice. Opening a set in 2022 with Robert Palmer’s 1986 hit Addicted to Love, in a delivery that embraces its dated production and sickly smooth sheen, is even odder. But in the world of Rod Stewart, it makes perfect sense. Aside from being perpetually locked into the 1980s – he emerges with trademark spiky blond hair, clad in a garish sparkly suit – the 77-year-old now has enjoyed a near 60-year career, the success of which is as much down to covers as it is originals. This is quickly hammered home by the fact that, four tracks in, Stewart covers Robert Palmer yet again, this time tackling the late singer’s take on the Persuaders’ Some Guys Have All the Luck.</p><p>Occasionally, he overlaps into pure magpie territory, as on Do Ya Think I’m Sexy?, a track Stewart has admitted involves “unconscious plagiarism” when it comes to lifting from the Jorge Ben track Taj Mahal, and which takes its synth hook directly from a Bobby Womack song. Naff lyrics and light plagiarism aside, the track as performed tonight is an undeniable disco stomper, with Stewart’s extensive band (which runs into double figures) locked into a taut, sultry groove.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/17/rod-stewart-review-glam-sailing-past-sell-by-date-motorpoint-arena-nottingham">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Charlotte Fantelli’s documentary about  activist Simon Sansome and his wife is let down by clichés and embarrassing reconstruction scenes</p><p>The intentions behind this documentary about disabled rights activist Simon Sansome and his wife, Kate, are noble, but the tacky, cliché-ridden execution doesn’t live up to them. Essentially, the film is built around one long interview with the Sansomes on how, not long after their wedding, Simon suddenly found himself paralysed from the waist down (“Little did we know it was going to be our final dance together,” he says). The combination of a clumsy chiropractor, a rare condition and misdiagnosis turned him into a wheelchair user.</p><p>The change in circumstances would lead to Simon losing his job as a Liberal Democrat councillor in his Leicestershire district and much anguish for the couple. Eventually, he discovered a way to make a difference by starting a campaign to improve access for disabled people and change attitudes. When Facebook wouldn’t let him share a tasteful image of a nude woman with a partially amputated leg, he kicked up a fuss and taped one of their representatives on the phone explaining that, at the time, the social media company censored images that some people might find disturbing. This surely must have caused a terrible headache for former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, now chief shill for Facebook, but the publicity did wonders for Simon’s Ability Access group, which forced the social media giant to apologise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/15/access-all-areas-review-sentimentality-doesnt-do-brave-family-justice">Continue reading...</a>

While 110% of footballers go into interviews looking to say as little as possible – at the end of the day, Geoff, that’s the name of the game – Maddison sees them as a blank canvas to have fun and express his personality.

## Is the perfect World Cup achievable or an impossible dream for football? | Daniel Harris

<p>Past tournaments have had great settings and matches for the ages … but terrible formats. Will the stars ever align?</p><p>At its best, the World Cup encapsulates the best of our species. Because football is a simple, dynamic game that provokes complex, elemental emotions, it crosses borders and cultures with impunity, making the cross-border, cross-cultural imperative of its global expression the greatest show on Earth. All human beings covet joy, community and identity – we might just call it love – and football is the most reliable conduit of mankind’s finest facility.</p><p>But what constitutes the perfect World Cup? For most of us, the answer is obvious: our debut. Which means that for some, the simple thrill of unrelenting football means that Qatar 2022 will forever be where it’s at – despite everything – while the rest of us try to assimilate the devastating compromises we’re about to make.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/17/is-perfect-world-cup-achievable-or-impossible-dream-for-football-qatar-2022">Continue reading...</a>

## I’m an art historian and climate activist: Just Stop Oil’s art attacks are becoming part of the problem | Lucy Whelan

<p>Attacking art works that are safely encased in glass does nothing to further the activists’ cause – if anything it makes a case for climate complacency</p><p>As an art historian, my job is to look askance at words such as “masterpiece”, and to question the canon of “great art”. In my spare time, I have also sprayed chalk paint on civic structures in protest at the lack of action on climate. So at first I expected to view the latest attacks on art as shocking but justifiable. After all, do these attacks not also reveal the fragility of what we hold dear? Do they not make us think about what we want to save for the next generation? Yet the answer to these questions, I decided, is mostly no. Instead, these attacks feel part of a helpless careering towards climate chaos.</p><p>As splash after splash of acidic liquid hits the glass casings of art works by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/14/just-stop-oil-activists-throw-soup-at-van-goghs-sunflowers">Van Gogh</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/23/climate-activists-mashed-potato-monet-potsdam-germany">Monet</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/15/climate-activists-throw-black-liquid-at-gustav-klimt-painting-in-vienna">Klimt</a>, and now <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/climate-protesters-hurled-maple-syrup-on-an-emily-carr-2209586">Emily Carr</a>, everyone around the world who sees the photographs and footage is going through the same mental process: an astonished intake of breath, followed by the realisation that everything is actually fine.

Period movies were the strictest in casting white people and that was the biggest barrier. So, it does seem that period films and dramas, such as Bridgerton, are where these massive breakthroughs are happening.

<p><strong>(Sub Pop)<br /></strong>Natalie Mering’s follow-up to the superb Titanic Rising sets 21st-century pessimism to one fantastic tune after another – and gently suggests this all may be deadpan humour</p><p>The last time the world heard from singer-songwriter Natalie Mering it was 2019, and Titanic Rising, her fourth album under the name Weyes Blood, was quite rightly being hailed as one of the year’s best. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/06/weyes-blood-titanic-rising-review-movies-sub-pop">Titanic Rising</a>’s sound was rich and very evocative of early 70s California. Its songs, however, were very much a product of the 21st century, marked by an pervading sense of imminent catastrophe, fuelled by an index of millennial worries that stretched from online dating to late capitalism and environmental collapse.</p><p>Not unexpectedly, the intervening three years haven’t done a lot to improve Mering’s mood. By her own account, she was not one of those people who found the Covid pandemic an unexpected but ultimately welcome reset, a chance to pause and breathe and take stock. “Has a time ever been more revealing that people are hurting,” she asks, rhetorically, on Titanic Rising’s successor, an album on which everything is broken and everyone is failing to connect with everyone else.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/17/weyes-blood-and-in-the-darkness-hearts-aglow-review-gloom-becomes-a-thing-of-beauty">Continue reading...</a>

<p>His campaign proved that class can be a driver of political behavior and a foundation of redistributive economic policy</p><p>The midterm elections last Tuesday blew a hole in conventional political wisdom. The supposed law that the president’s party could never win a midterm. That partisanship was too entrenched for voters to split their tickets between parties at a high rate. That candidate quality and experience no longer mattered. That politics has been so nationalized that the entire country would get more Republican or Democratic together, rather than different climates in different states or regions. The most important myth busted for people with leftwing politics is the impressive win of John Fetterman for Senate in Pennsylvania. Fetterman proved that progressive politics really could win back working class white Trump voters in rural areas.</p><p>The idea that populist redistributive economics could win back working class Trump voters has been proposed since immediately after the 2016 election. It made sense ideologically to leftists, but there was no proof of concept until this election. Every attempt at using Medicare for All and anti-elite rhetoric to bring Trump voters in ancestrally Democratic areas back to the party had failed miserably. The platform and messaging of Fetterman, however, led him to a shocking 4.4% win in a state that President Biden won by just 1.1%. The president’s party flipping a Senate seat in a midterm election, let alone quadrupling the president’s winning margin, is incredibly rare. Respected sites like Fivethirtyeight and Sabato’s Crystal Ball viewed Oz as a clear favorite. Beyond this, Fetterman flipped the script on 40 years of partisan trends. Fetterman matched Biden’s margins in highly educated urban and suburban areas that have been getting more Democratic for decades, especially in the Trump era. His surprising winning margin came most of all from drastically improving on Biden’s margins in working class post-industrial and rural areas that had been getting redder for the last few decades, even faster than the suburbs had been getting bluer.

<p>General Electric was a 20th-century industrial empire. What caused it to fall apart?</p><p>The executive suite of General Electric’s Connecticut headquarters was known as “carpet land”. Persian rugs and dense wool carpet covered every floor, creating an atmosphere of hushed probity. For almost a century, GE had stamped its curling blue logo on just about everything, from wind turbines to submarine detectors, fridges, televisions, toasters and lightbulbs. The office was a monument to the baronial power of its CEO. Jeff Immelt, the final chief to occupy this floor, enjoyed the use of a shoeshine station, a pantry and dining room. His two assistants also had their own private bathroom. When Immelt travelled by private jet, as he often did, a second, empty jet would often<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ges-new-chief-starts-making-cuts-starting-with-old-favorites-1508353939" title=""> trail behind him</a> in case of mechanical failures on the first plane.</p><p>At its peak, GE was an industrial empire worth almost $600bn.

They said I’d only be out of school for a week, so of course I said yes. That week turned into two, which spiralled into five as I was swept off to Milan and Paris to walk in Jil Sander, Balenciaga and Louis Vuitton.</p><p>Zoë Huxford is a writer and journalist based in London</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But after more than 45 years in the notoriously secretive church – which he now regards as “a mind prison” – he broke out.</p><p>Fifteen years on, he has written a book about his time inside.

<p>China’s generational trauma and the long shadow of the Cultural Revolution are brought into the light in this precise and gripping novel</p><p>Two estranged childhood friends, Li Jiaqi and Cheng Gong, talk through the night. Snow falls silently outside and the body of an old man lies in another room. We are on a university campus in Jinan, the capital of Shandong province. We do not know exactly why the conversation is so important that Jiaqi sought out Gong after an absence of 18 years, but we do know that a dark secret links their two families, that its effects have ricocheted across three generations and that Jiaqi is determined that tonight it will be laid to rest. “We’ll talk all night if we have to,” she writes. “And then the secret will be left behind.”</p><p>Zhang Yueran is one of China’s most celebrated contemporary authors. Still in her 30s, she has found success both with short fiction and with a series of elegantly constructed novels that return frequently to the state of the family in China: absent fathers, stepmother relationships and the vicissitudes of close, sibling-like friendships between only children. The party state has disrupted Chinese families for decades and it shows: in the 1950s the creation of people’s communes threatened to integrate the family into the collective; in the 60s, children saw parents denounced and humiliated in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/the-cultural-revolution-50-years-on-all-you-need-to-know-about-chinas-political-convulsion" title="">Cultural Revolution</a>; in the 80s and 90s urbanisation split millions, as children were left behind with grandparents while their parents became migrant workers, and a brutally enforced one-child policy meant no siblings, aunts, uncles or cousins.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/17/cocoon-by-zhang-yueran-review-families-warped-by-the-state">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The victims of this World Cup are owed our remembrance and our future vigilance, even as the football takes centre stage</p><p>And now, finally, some football. For much of the 12 years since Sepp Blatter’s fumbling fingers ripped open an envelope containing one word and a thousand questions, the 2022 World Cup has been able to exist in our minds as little more than a surreal abstraction. A computer-generated simulation. Some Philip K Dick-infused vision of a future that might never come to pass; that could even somehow be averted if we made the right choices.

<p>From Pandora rings to Uniqlo sweatshirts, it is hard to avoid the 80s graffiti artist’s designs. Such collaborations enable his charitable foundation to dish out millions in grants, but not everyone is happy</p><p>Google Keith Haring and unlike fellow artists – Picasso, say, or Tracey Emin – you are as likely to find adverts as art. The ads suggest a sweatshirt from Abercrombie &amp; Fitch featuring Haring’s artwork on the front for £60. A ring from Pandora with Haring’s dancing figures around the design for £125. Or a Uniqlo T-shirt, with two figures and a heart, for £14.90.</p><p>This is only a fraction of the items you can now buy displaying Haring’s artwork. The Keith Haring Foundation – the organisation responsible for his imagery since his death in 1990 – has partnered with a plethora of brands in recent months including H&amp;M, Primark and Bershka, collaborations that follow its partnership with Uniqlo, which began in 2003. More than 30 years after his death, Haring’s crawling babies, barking dogs and dancing figures are ubiquitous.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/nov/17/keith-haring-art-fashion-brand-partnerships">Continue reading...</a>

Sure, Toby Fleishman (Jesse Eisenberg) is stressed about his ex-wife Rachel’s (Claire Danes) disappearance – she dropped off their two kids a day early, left on a surprise yoga retreat and then went MIA. But what non-book readers may assume to be the premise of a thriller – what happened to Rachel? – will find dread that’s far more mundane. Toby assumes his ex, a chilly, hard-charging theater agent with a fittingly blunt bob, to be acting self-interested as usual. To him, her disappearance is less sinister than cynical, and very annoying – he’s trying to be a good doctor, working full-time at an esteemed hospital, and now he has to be a full-time single dad.</p><p>Mundane, yet still potent.

<p>A decade after publishing her first guide to tidying up, the writer and TV presenter has a new book about creating living spaces that ‘foster conversation’. But can she help me clear up the disaster that is my desk? And will it spark joy?</p><p>How do you tidy up before Marie Kondo arrives at your house? The 38-year-old queen of domestic serenity has been bossing chaos since 2011, when she published The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Then in 2016 came Spark Joy, an illustrated follow-up, and pretty soon the entire world – I’m not exaggerating – was familiar with her principles: separate your belongings into categories: clothes, books, papers, miscellany, sentimental items. Go through, in that order, and pick up each item, hold it in your hands, ask yourself if it sparks joy. If it doesn’t, discard it. “For the things that you decide to let go, you thank it for having sparked joy in the past,” she tells me later, through an interpreter. “Out loud?” I ask, appalled. “Silently is fine.” All that remains is to decide where to put your joy-sparking items.</p><p>Pause for a second, here: I have been scoffing at the notion of thanking objects since I read Kondo’s handbag advice (you’re meant to thank it at the end of each day), but that is cloth-eared. The Shinto religion – Kondo isn’t incredibly observant, but was a <em>miko</em> (shrine maiden) in her late teens – is animist, and holds that some inanimate objects can gain a soul after 100 years of service. So there is nothing ridiculous about feeling gratitude to a thing; ridiculous is clinging on to a thing that plainly <em>doesn’t </em>have a soul.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/17/she-dropped-three-cheese-and-onion-crisps-and-a-tooth-into-my-hand-what-happened-when-marie-kondo-tidied-my-home">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An arbitrary target is the source of this ‘shortfall’. Uncertain forecasts are not the basis for huge spending and tax decisions</p><ul><li>James Meadway is director of the Progressive Economy Forum</li></ul><p>Today the new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, will present a set of spending cuts that are widely expected to be a return to the grim days of George Osborne’s reign. “Eye-watering” spending cuts and tax rises have been heavily trailed in the media. The chancellor, his government and their media outriders have justified this renewed attack on public services and economic prosperity by pointing at a huge and terrifying new celestial body: the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/13/dont-be-taken-in-by-50bn-fiscal-hole-dodgy-tory-metaphor">fiscal black hole</a>” – which is alleged to have emerged in the public finances in the last month, and perhaps be as big as £60bn. The government has been left with no choice, in the words of the Institute for Fiscal Studies’ director, Paul Johnson, to inflict “<a href="https://twitter.com/PJTheEconomist/status/1579719560491847680?s=20&amp;t=H-ccqLj2riNOpImzjtpfMQ">big, painful spending cuts</a>” or tax rises.</p><p>Yet this screeching U-turn in government policy – contradicting promises to end austerity and its commitments in the 2019 manifesto – is being driven by nothing more than an insubstantial statistical artefact. The “fiscal black hole” is not a hard economic fact. It’s the result of uncertain forecasts<strong> </strong>and the government’s own target for the level of debt in five years’ time. This isn’t the same as looking at (for instance) real wages – currently falling rapidly – or rising unemployment today. It would be a profound error to use this ghostly “fiscal hole” as an excuse to drag the country back into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/25/cbi-warns-rishi-sunak-against-doom-loop-of-public-spending-cuts">economic doom-loop of austerity</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/17/tories-fiscal-black-hole-statistical-fiction-spending-tax">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Philippines young population and changing demographics could present crucial new opportunities for economic growth </p><p>At Batasan Hills National High School in the Philippines, every inch of space is used meticulously. Classrooms have been divided in half to make way for extra groups of students and there are designated entry points and passing lanes to accommodate the crowds in between lessons. Even the space under the staircases is not wasted: it’s here, below the sloped ceiling, with no natural light, that teachers cram together to plan lessons and hold faculty meetings.</p><p>It’s not, however, enough to fully accommodate the intake of 18,638 students, so instead, the school has resorted to running two shifts, with some students starting class at 6am, while others study from the afternoon until 7.20pm. Other classes are held online.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/17/the-school-with-18000-students-educating-the-philippines-booming-population">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Guardian’s economics editor, Larry Elliott, looks ahead to Jeremy Hunt’s crucial autumn statement, which is set to usher in a new era of austerity, and explains why is likely to fail just like George Osborne’s before it</p><p>When the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, stands up in the Commons later on Thursday to deliver the government’s autumn statement on the economy it will be to lay out in stark terms the problems the country is facing and the painful way he intends to fix them.</p><p>But not everyone is convinced the fiscal pain will lead to economic gain. The Guardian’s economics editor, <strong>Larry Elliott</strong>,<strong> </strong>tells <strong>Nosheen Iqbal </strong>that far from ushering in a new period of economic prosperity, the solutions Hunt is coming up with sound strikingly similar to those of George Osborne, whose own austerity drive failed to return the UK to economic health. Now Elliott argues that raising everyone’s taxes while slashing government spending will simply further choke the economy of growth and lead to a prolonged recession. The government argues it must reassure markets about Britain’s creditworthiness (after the spectacular failure of Trussonomics). The treatment will hurt, but will it work?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/nov/17/autumn-statement-2022-its-going-to-hurt-but-will-it-work-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
