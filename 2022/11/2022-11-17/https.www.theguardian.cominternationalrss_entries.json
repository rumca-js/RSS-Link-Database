Naff lyrics and light plagiarism aside, the track as performed tonight is an undeniable disco stomper, with Stewart\u2019s extensive band (which runs into double figures) locked into a taut, sultry groove.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/17/rod-stewart-review-glam-sailing-past-sell-by-date-motorpoint-arena-nottingham\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/nov/17/stephen-colbert-trump-2024-seth-meyers-jimmy-kimmel", "title": "Stephen Colbert on Trump\u2019s 2024 bid launch: \u2018Even his family didn\u2019t show\u2019", "date_published": "2022-11-17 16:23:44+00:00", "description": "<p>Late-night hosts talk Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential announcement at Mar-a-Lago, absent most of his children or GOP politicians</p><p>Stephen Colbert lamented the official start of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/nov/15/donald-trump-2024-announcement-president-republican-nomination-speech-live-updates\">Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign</a> on Wednesday evening, following the ex-president\u2019s Tuesday announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s 2016 all over again,\u201d he joked, \u201ccrank up Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade, throw on the all-female Ghostbusters, because we are Pok\u00e9mon Go-ing back to hell.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/nov/17/stephen-colbert-trump-2024-seth-meyers-jimmy-kimmel\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/15/access-all-areas-review-sentimentality-doesnt-do-brave-family-justice", "title": "Access All Areas review \u2013 brave family\u2019s quest to change attitudes to disability", "date_published": "2022-11-17 16:19:01+00:00", "description": "<p>Charlotte Fantelli\u2019s documentary about  activist Simon Sansome and his wife is let down by clich\u00e9s and embarrassing reconstruction scenes</p><p>The intentions behind this documentary about disabled rights activist Simon Sansome and his wife, Kate, are noble, but the tacky, clich\u00e9-ridden execution doesn\u2019t live up to them.

When the news was announced that Channel 5 was ending Neighbours, we went through denial (\u201cNeighbours is too famous to die\u201d) and anger (\u201cWill nobody think of Toadfish? This show is all he\u2019s got\u201d) and now we are firmly into the bargaining stage.</p><p>Well, have I got wonderful news for you. The bargaining stage of grief actually works, because the show is back. Today it was announced that the corpse of Neighbours will soon be revived by Amazon Freevee, which has struck a deal to haul the soap back into production in the coming months. If you are in the UK or US, Neighbours will once again be free to watch on Freevee, Amazon\u2019s free streaming service. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/17/amazon-neighbours-the-undead-apocalypse-the-soap-opera-that-came-back-from-the-dead\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/17/freida-pinto-i-was-a-sweaty-dancing-teletubby", "title": "Freida Pinto: \u2018I was a sweaty, dancing Teletubby\u2019", "date_published": "2022-11-17 12:13:15+00:00", "description": "<p>The actor answers your questions on her time as Laa-Laa, playing a British spy, getting a decent curry in LA, and her pole-dancing skills</p><p><strong>In your latest film, </strong><strong>Mr Malcolm\u2019s</strong><strong> List</strong><strong>, you</strong><strong> are cast with no regard to skin colour</strong><strong> or race, as was your Slumdog ex, </strong><strong>Dev Patel</strong><strong>, in </strong><strong>The Personal History of David Copperfield</strong><strong>.

The supposed law that the president\u2019s party could never win a midterm. That partisanship was too entrenched for voters to split their tickets between parties at a high rate. That candidate quality and experience no longer mattered. That politics has been so nationalized that the entire country would get more Republican or Democratic together, rather than different climates in different states or regions.

It made sense ideologically to leftists, but there was no proof of concept until this election. Every attempt at using Medicare for All and anti-elite rhetoric to bring Trump voters in ancestrally Democratic areas back to the party had failed miserably. The platform and messaging of Fetterman, however, led him to a shocking 4.4% win in a state that President Biden won by just 1.1%. The president\u2019s party flipping a Senate seat in a midterm election, let alone quadrupling the president\u2019s winning margin, is incredibly rare. Respected sites like Fivethirtyeight and Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball viewed Oz as a clear favorite. Beyond this, Fetterman flipped the script on 40 years of partisan trends. Fetterman matched Biden\u2019s margins in highly educated urban and suburban areas that have been getting more Democratic for decades, especially in the Trump era. His surprising winning margin came most of all from drastically improving on Biden\u2019s margins in working class post-industrial and rural areas that had been getting redder for the last few decades, even faster than the suburbs had been getting bluer.
