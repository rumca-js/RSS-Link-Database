Yes, your city may be the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-streets" target="_blank">crack and poop capital of America</a>.

But your government is leaping to action! Not to fix any of those things. They aren't even helping all San Fran citizens. Only the trans one. If you are trans, you can now get paid to be trans in the comfort of your own home.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/san-francisco-launches-guaranteed-income-program-transgender-people" target="_blank">Fox News reports</a> the city is launching a guaranteed income program for the city’s transgender residents to help with, quote, "financial security." If you are both a poor and a trans you may be eligible for payments of up to $1200 each month, up to 18 months. Only if you are trans-poor. If you are cis-poor, meh.</p><p>Citizen journalist Libs of TikTok has reviewed the application process, and reports there are NINETY-SEVEN different genders to choose from.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The application for transgender San Francisco residents to receive guaranteed income, has NINETY SEVEN gender options.

</p><p>San Francisco. It's not safe to leave your house to go to work. But now, if you're trans, thanks to the government and the taxpayers who keep electing the same people to government, you don't have to. The government will send you a check. Being the #1 ranked pound-for-pound most marginalized now has its perks.</p><p><p>

## Critics lash out at Tim Allen's alleged right-wing Santa Claus in 'The Santa Clauses'

That's the basis for any outrage involving the center-right actor. And it's the basis for why reviewers are lashing out at <em>The Santa Clauses</em>.</p><p>Some back story. In 1994, Tim Allen accidentally caused Santa Claus to fall off his roof. Due to a clause, that turned Allen into Santa. 18 years later, Disney is determined to take any property anyone may have liked ever and run it into the ground. They took Allen's Santa and turned it into a mini-series, <em>The Santa Clauses</em>.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

</p>
<p>Apparently, in one of the episodes, Santa (Allen) says "Saying ‘Merry Christmas to all’ has suddenly become problematic." Cheesy, yes. But it's sentiment I would understand Santa Claus agreeing with. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jack-carr-terminal-list" target="_blank">For leftist reviewers</a>, it is literally worse than leaving coal in their Yuleza stockings. Or voting Ron DeSantis for president.</p><p><a href="https://www.avclub.com/the-santa-clauses-saying-merry-christmas-problematic-1849792146" target="_blank">AVClub </a>can't even: "What was going on in the minds of the writers as they penned this semi-political one-liner?"</p><p><a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/the-santa-clauses-series-review/" target="_blank">Digital Trends</a>, referring to Santa as "right-wing" and "weird," says the line stripped the story of its charm. "It's like [Santa] spent too much of the Christmas offseason watching Fox News."</p><h2>It's a f*cking throwaway line.</h2><p>That's what reviewers, no doubt crying over today's Nancy Pelosi news, are upset over.</p><p>I said this in <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/yellowstone-season-premiere-red-state" target="_blank">talking about <em>Yellowstone</em></a>. I hate calling a show "anti-woke," but it happens for one of two reasons. The first is that your show doesn't overtly sh*t all over conservatives, and conservatives enjoy not overtly being sh*t on. The second is that your show doesn't overtly sh*t all over conservatives, and liberals think it's weird that it doesn't.</p><p>That's why reviewers attack Yellowstone as "a conservative fantasy" and are freaking out on a show made for children because they think the lead is a “cranky, conservative Santa Claus.” These same dinkus movie reviewers <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-terminal-list-critics" target="_blank">can't understand why everyone thinks they suck at life</a>.</p><p>Short of my nieces or nephew wanting to watch, I have no plans of watching <em>The Santa Clauses</em>. Yes, even though Tim Allen made a joke that on a 1 -10 scale of basedness comes in at a 5.1. There are too many Hallmark movies and I only so many hours of the day. </p><p>But for all the attacks conservatives get for complaining when there is something on TV we don't like, "professional" "reviewers" have a habit of acting like anything they see that's even the tiniest bit right-leaning is the worst thing to ever happen to them.</p><p><p>

## Conservatives school board members fire woke superintendent, and NBC News is desperate to make it about race

We won the House, and there were a number of local victories that should not be discounted. In South Carolina, they built off of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/florida-school-board-results" target="_blank">Ron DeSantis's early 2022 success in flipping school boards</a> and took over some school boards of their own.

## Target reveals how much they've lost to theft and the total is mindblowing... unless you've been paying attention

Also known as $400,000,000.00. And the year isn't over with, as we enter the holiday shoplifting season.</p><p><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/11/16/target-blames-organized-crime-for-400m-loss-in-profits/" target="_blank">The NY Post reports</a>:</p><blockquote>Fiddelke added that “we expect it will reduce our gross margin by more than $600 million for the full year.”</blockquote><blockquote>A Target spokesperson told Yahoo! Finance that the “shrinkage” which the CFO referred to was attributed specifically to “organized retail crime.”</blockquote><p>I'd like to see Target's numbers compared to Best Buy's. Target <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/santa-hat-steal-target" target="_blank">lets people walk out the door</a> with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/man-robs-target-ankle-monitor" target="_blank">bags full of schtuff</a>. At Best Buy, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/best-buy-nfl-defense" target="_blank">employees aren't afraid</a> to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/best-buy-female-employee-shoplifter" target="_blank">tackle someone</a> or otherwise take them down.</p><p>Someone reading a newspaper would read the number "400 million" and say to themselves, "Self, that is a lot of theft. What is happening to my country? Someone should do something!" Those of you familiar with the words "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/search/?q=shoplift" target="_blank">shoplifting</a>" and "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/search/?q=flash+mob" target="_blank">flash mobs</a>" know that the wrong people have.</p><p>In America, we have these places called progressive cities, where progressive voters keep electing progressive politicians to enact progressive policies. Some of those policies, classified under the heading "defund the police," have amended laws to where stealing isn't as illegal as it used to be. Anything over $1000 is still illegal. Anything $999 or under isn't illegal as much as it is frowned upon.</p><p>That's why there is video after video after video of people walking out of stores all non-challant like with handfuls full of stolen goods. It's under $1000, so security didn't bother. Someone did the math and determined that if you organize ten people to steal $999 worth of goods each, that's close to $10000 worth of goods. Hence, the "organized:" element.</p><p>That is not to say that stealing only takes place in progressive cities. But out here in real America, it is more common for us to enforce "laws."</p><p>As for "someone should do something," people had the opportunity to do so a week ago Tuesday. They chose not to in many places.</p><p><p>

## Haters freak out on actor Zachary Levi over a common-sense criticism of Ukraine funding

Real ones know him as Chuck from <em>Chuck</em>, one of the most underrated shows of the past two decades. It featured a young, not quite as based Adam Baldwin. A hot blonde number too whose name I don't remember. Check it out on the Hulu.</p><p>Levi dipped his toe ever so slightly into politics and you'll totally believe what happened next! The actor shared a tweet that compared how much we have sent to Ukraine in comparison to other war spending. Most notably, the $ 91.3 billion we've sent is 33% more than Russia's <em>total military spending for the year</em> and <em>double</em> the US's average annual expenditure for its own war in Afghanistan.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">This. Is. Not. Okay. Period. <a href="https://t.co/I16OKD59IX">https://t.co/I16OKD59IX</a><br />— Zachary Levi (@ZacharyLevi) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZacharyLevi/status/1593019213060648961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>A five-word tweet sharing mind-blowing government expenditures is rather milquetoast.

PRIMARY SEASON. Not a civil war. Donald Trump announced. Ron DeSantis hasn't announced... yet? But we're at the point where whenever DeSantis takes questions from the press, someone is going to ask "hey, what about that thing the guy who supports the other guy said?" On Wednesday, DeSantis informed people they can take their GOP civil war and stick it up their nose.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">JUST IN: Gov.

<p>Hearing about an alleged civil war in the GOP is tiresome. The media pushes it because they want there to be a civil war. Then because so much of being on the right these days means having a knee-jerk reaction to the left,  the attitude among some conservatives is that no one should be criticizing anyone lest you "give the media what they want." Ronald Reagan's 11th Commandment gets thrown around about not attacking other Republicans. Ignoring the fact Reagan ran a primary challenge against a sitting Republican president.</p><p>It's not a "civil war" for different groups on the right to have a different presidential candidate in mind, advocate for that person, and criticize the other candidates for why they wouldn't be as effective. It's a PRIMARY. It's healthy. It's what adults do. Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump are both grown-ass men.</p><p>Plus, even though <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2022/11/16/desantis-leads-trump-by-18-points-in-hypothetical-poll-n2616052" target="_blank">a recent poll has him up 18 points over Trump</a>, DeSantis hasn't announced anything yet. He is right about everyone needing to chill out until at least we get past the runoff. But all the different sects on the right should embrace debate and shouldn;t be afraid to choose sides as we decide who we want our next candidate to be.</p><p><p>
