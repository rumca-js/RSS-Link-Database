<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced late last week that it will close down the free Wickr Me encrypted messaging service, saying in a blog post that it plans to “refocus” on its related AWS Wickr and Wickr Enterprise products at the expense of the consumer wing of the Wickr family.</p><p>Wickr has been in operation for a decade, making it one of the first end-to-end encrypted messaging apps on the market. Wickr Me was popular with journalists and whistleblowers alike as a method of secure communication of sensitive information, according to experts, but it was also alleged to be in wide use as a medium for illicit content like child sex abuse and drug transactions, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/wickr-amazon-aws-child-messaging-app-sex-abuse-problem-rcna20674" rel="nofollow">according to a June report from NBC News</a>.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3680554/amazon-shuts-wickr-me-encrypted-messaging-service-enterprise-service-remains.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>For many years, the term “out-of-band Microsoft update” meant that Microsoft was releasing a special patch for a security issue identified as being under active attack. The patch was urgent enough to be released outside the normal “Patch Tuesday” security updates released the second Tuesday of every month.</p><p>But recently Microsoft has been releasing out-of-band updates that fix issues that were introduced with the monthly security updates. Often people install the monthly security updates without realizing that there are additional ways that Microsoft fixes issues introduced by its patches.</p><p>Because Windows 10 and 11 updates are cumulative, when you install an update it’s an all or nothing deployment. There is no way to install some components of the update without installing all of it. Depending on where the underlying problem with a patch lies, Microsoft can use either an out-of-band update or a Known Issue Rollback to introduce a fix to the system. Let’s explore both of these methods.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3680574/out-of-band-windows-updates-and-known-issue-rollbacks-explained.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
