  <p id="31A8wn">After purging nearly two-thirds of Twitter’s 7,500-person workforce in three weeks, Elon Musk is hiring again.</p>
<p id="FQYlJF">During an all-hands meeting with employees on Monday, Musk said that Twitter is done with layoffs and actively recruiting for roles in engineering and sales and that employees are encouraged to make referrals, according to two people who attended and a partial recording obtained by <em>The Verge. </em>His comments were made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/21/23471021/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs-sales-partnerships-workers">the same day an unspecified wave of cuts hit Twitter’s sales department</a>, which has lost almost all of its senior leadership since Musk took over.</p>
<p id="Akja60">Musk didn’t specify the kinds of engineers or sales roles Twitter was hiring for, and the company doesn’t currently have any open roles listed on its website. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/17/23465274/hundreds-of-twitter-employees-resign-from-elon-musk-hardcore-deadline"><em>The Verge </em>r...</a></p>

  <p id="trRpZZ">Buying a refurbished device rather than one that’s brand-new can save you a ton of money. However, these products don’t usually get the spotlight from retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, or B&amp;H Photo. You also won’t find them sitting on the homepage of Apple, Google, Nintendo, Sonos, or Microsoft, to name a few. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t find refurbs on these sites. </p>
<p id="AEqzQD">First, a quick description of what “refurbished” means. If it has been refurbished, that likely means the product was either broken or roughed up enough to warrant a repair. It could also mean that whoever bought it simply decided they didn’t want it and returned it to the store. The definition of what makes for a refurbished product varies depending on the seller,...</p>

As things have opened up, many of us are still using videoconferencing apps to keep in touch with work colleagues, family, and friends.

  <p id="SOoXw3">In a sudden turn of events, Disney has reversed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21153317/bob-iger-disney-ceo-steps-down-chapek-kevin-mayer-parks-products-succession">the CEO swap that surprised us in early 2020</a>, with Bob Iger <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-board-of-directors-appoints-robert-a-iger-as-chief-executive-officer/">returning to his post</a>, replacing his own successor, Bob Chapek. Iger, who is also the company’s largest shareholder, is now set to serve a new two-year term as CEO. Part of Iger’s job in those two years will be to pick and groom his long-term successor.</p>
<p id="v6tlhA">Of course, Chapek was an Iger choice too. Chapek <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21153579/disney-ceo-bob-iger-chapek-mayer-streaming-succession-tim-cook-steve-jobs">had been called the “Tim Cook to Iger’s Steve Jobs,”</a> but during his tenure, their handover got off to a rocky start, while blowups like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release">Scarlett Johansson <em>Black Widow</em> lawsuit</a> and Disney’s initial lack of reaction to the “Don’t Say Gay” bill in Florida scuffed its all-important reputation.</p>
