He said something nice about Andy Ngo. Specifically, Andy's book exposing Antifa as a terrorist organization. Leftists are okay with Antifa being terrorist organization. What they HATE is anyone famous who has an opposing viewpoint from theirs. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/andy-ngo-new-orleans" target="_blank">These are the types of leftists who assault random Asian guys</a> thinking they're Andy.</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/winston-marshall-leaves-mumford-sons" target="_blank">Marshall followed the usual script</a> upon being attacked. He apologized for the high crime of tweeting a nice thing about a book he read. He begged for forgiveness. He said he was taking a leave of absence from the band to reflect on what he did and how he can better himself from it. During that leave, he realized: "Wait, I'm NOT sorry."</p><p>Marshall told Glenn Beck about this sudden epiphany.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Former Mumford and Sons banjoist <a href="https://twitter.com/MrWinMarshall?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MrWinMarshall</a> tells me how he went from apologizing to the woke mob for tweeting about Andy Ngo's book exposing Antifa to speaking out against the mob: "I looked deeper and deeper into the topic, and I realized I HADN'T been wrong." <a href="https://t.co/fkrEVIMDCO">pic.twitter.com/fkrEVIMDCO</a><br />— Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) <a href="https://twitter.com/glennbeck/status/1594498327315247104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>His main reason for apologizing was that people were coming after his bandmates, and it seemed like the right thing to do. It wasn't. And he soon realized that.</p><blockquote>I looked deeper into the topic and realized I hadn't been wrong. I called the author brave. Not only was he brave, but he'd also been attacked by Antifa mobs. And so my conscience really started to bother me. I was also frustrated because I felt like I was excusing the behavior of Antifa by apologizing for criticizing it. Which then made me feel I'm as bad as the problem because I'm sort of agreeing it doesn't exist.</blockquote><p>When Marshall <a href="https://mrwinstonmarshall.medium.com/why-im-leaving-mumford-sons-e6e731bbc255" target="_blank">first apologized for apologizing</a> back in June of 2021, he said of leaving the band "<em>I could remain and continue to self-censor but it will erode my sense of integrity."</em></p><p>Marshall's right. When you apologize for something you are not sorry for and that you are not wrong about, you are saying that the truth is wrong. You make it harder for the next person to come along and say accurate and factual things that leftists don't want to hear. Things like, "Hey, I found this book interesting."</p><p>People who are quick to bend their knee ARE part of the problem. The left just makes up an excuse for you to bend the other one. Marshall knows that now and I hope he helps his peers realie that too.</p><p><p>

Like most people who make dramatic proclamations about leaving the bird app, they are already back. It was less than forty-eight hours.</p><p>CBS journalismer Jonathan Vigliotti <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cbs-news-twitter-pause" target="_blank">made the announcement on Friday evening</a>: "In light of the uncertainty around Twitter, and out of an abundance of caution, CBS News is pausing its activity on the social media site, as it continues to monitor the platform."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">CBS News and its owned and operated stations are “pausing” activity on Twitter; blaming “uncertainty” on the platform. <a href="https://t.co/Pv1gEQjQJH">pic.twitter.com/Pv1gEQjQJH</a><br />— Jim Lokay (@LokayFOX5) <a href="https://twitter.com/LokayFOX5/status/1593828049321361410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Less than forty-eight hours later, the PR department issued a statement that "after pausing for much of the weekend to assess the security concerns," they decided to resume media activity. But rest assured, they will be monitoring the situation.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Not germane to the situation I'm sure, but over those forty-eight hours, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-trolls-trump" target="_blank">Donald Trump had his account restored</a>.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>If CBS News had any self-respect, they would be embarrassed for themselves. But this is the network that employed Dan Rather for all those years. While we all have a hearty laugh at their expense, no one finds it funnier than Elon Musk.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">🤭<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1594425023011254272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Who then made things weird with a meme from the award-winning homosexual cowboy movie <em>Brokeback Mountain</em>. Playing the role of Heath Ledger is CBS News.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Our love will never die <a href="https://t.co/y5SldfAAt0">pic.twitter.com/y5SldfAAt0</a><br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1594509880840388610?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>What happened is CBS News attempted a power move expecting other news outlets to follow suit. Elon taking over Twitter and the left no longer having total control over the flow of information upsets the natural order of things. CBS wanted to be the ones who took the brave stance, led the boycott, and drove Twitter out of business unless Elon agreed to go back to throttling opposing viewpoints and deplatforming anyone leftists and the media (but I repeat myself) don't like. </p><p>The other media outlets didn't jump. CBS News was forced to crawl back with their blue checkmark between their legs. </p><p><p>

## Elon Musk launches operation to troll Trump into returning to Twitter the only way he knows how... with memes

And over the weekend he brought back to Twitter someone who rarely logs off himself, edgelord-in-chief Donald J. Trump. The rub is Trump doesn't seem to want to return to the bird app. Yet.</p><p>To recap, Trump was permanently banned from Twitter for some reason in January of 2021. He started his own social media app, TruthSocial. Over a year later, Elon Musk bought Twitter. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-twitter-poll" target="_blank">He polled the audience if he should bring Trump back</a>. When the audience voted yes, Elon reinstated Trump <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trump-twitter" target="_blank">to the dismay of haters and losers</a>.</p><p>The rub is that as of Monday morning, Trump has yet to return to spending his days live-tweeting cable news and retweeting anyone who says nice things about him. Elon is trying his best to entice Trump's return the only way he knows how to... saucy memes.</p><p>Elon shared a meme implying that Twitter is a loose woman shaking her ass in front of Trump, who is praying that he will not be tempted by the ass being shaken in front of him. I'm more of a boob guy myself, but I can understand Trump's perceived dilemma. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">And lead us not into temptation … <a href="https://t.co/8qNOXzwXS9">pic.twitter.com/8qNOXzwXS9</a><br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1594500655724609536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>In another meme that Elon deleted for some reason, it presupposes Twitter is a bottle of opioids and Trump is an addict who has gotten himself off the junk. But all it takes is just one taste.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="15da2" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32130205&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Donald Trump is standing his ground as of this writing. He does not see any reason to return Why would he? All the haters and losers who wan't Trump kept off Twitter keep tweeting screen captures of what Trump says on TruthSocial. They're doing all the work for him.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Former President Donald Trump responds to <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@elonmusk</a> Twitter poll <a href="https://t.co/70psMSdDry">pic.twitter.com/70psMSdDry</a><br />— Whole Mars Catalog (@WholeMarsBlog) <a href="https://twitter.com/WholeMarsBlog/status/1594111547177021441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>We'll see if Trump returns. I can understand him standing his ground. I can also see him coming back out of spite because "they" don't want him to. Whatever the former president's decision, Elon has a desktop folder full of memes and it's clear he is not afraid to use them.</p><p><p>

There are few people we enjoy writing about more at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website than the Polk County #1 lawman. Sheriff Judd has a swagger about him as he regales the press with tales of justice being served. Sometimes the perp goes quietly. Other times there is a conflict. And on occasion, the perp catches a bullet in the penis.</p><p>Here now is America's Sheriff to tell you more.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Florida police shot an arsonist in the dick.

There was a highway pursuit. Polk County's finest stopped the perp's vehicle. The perp exited his vehicle and came at the police with two guns. And that's when his dingly dangly got swiss cheese'd up.</p><p>The perp was treated at a local hospital for non life-threatening gunshot wounds.
