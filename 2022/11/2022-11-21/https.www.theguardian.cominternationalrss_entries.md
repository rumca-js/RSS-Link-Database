<p>The first animation from the entertainment giant to feature an openly gay teen, about an end-of-days environmental disaster, tries to shoehorn too much in</p><p>For his latest Disney animation, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/01/moana-review-disney-polynesian-adventure">Moana</a> director Don Hall has created a wonderfully surreal subterranean land that looks like something that might have been dreamed up by Jules Verne, all DayGlo-pink blobby bonkersness. It’s a strange world populated by weird creatures: shoals of fish flying through the air and an enormous critter that’s a cross between a dinosaur and a jellyfish. The human characters aren’t half bad either: a family of gung-ho explorers. Shame, then, about the environmentally themed plot, which is so tangled it would take the entire Royal Geographical Society a decade to map out.</p><p>Dennis Quaid voices paterfamilias Jaeger Clade, a legendary explorer with enormous hands (he’s like Sir Ranulph Fiennes beefed up for a Marvel role). Jaeger disappeared 25 years ago on an expedition, leaving his son Searcher (nicely played by Jake Gyllenhaal) dealing with daddy issues. Searcher, rebelling against his famous father who he feels never loved him, became a hippy farmer. Now he has a teenage son of his own, Ethan (Jaboukie Young-White), who in an early scene we watch flirting with another boy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/21/strange-world-review-disneys-tangled-alt-family-eco-drama-means-well">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The threat of ‘sporting sanctions’ from Fifa was enough for England and other countries to abandon their principles</p><p>Every man has a limit. A place they will not be taken, a line that will not be crossed, a point at which they bend and break. And as England’s footballers peeled off their smart blue training jackets a few minutes before 4pm local time at the Khalifa International Stadium, perhaps we discovered theirs.</p><p>They really, really wanted to wear the armband. Perhaps was the main thing. Indeed that was the thrust of the Football Association’s statement issued about an hour before kick-off in their opening World Cup game against Iran, in which it declared it was “very frustrated” with Fifa’s ban on the little strip of elastane that had been unveiled with such proud fanfare in advance of the tournament. On reflection, maybe the real armband was the press releases it issued along the way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/21/england-show-their-true-colours-with-meek-surrender-in-armband-fiasco">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Agassizhorn is an alp in Switzerland named after a notorious scientist. Sasha Huber explains why she flew to the summit by helicopter and rechristened it Rentyhorn – in honour of an enslaved man</p><p></p><p></p><p>In August 2008, <a href="http://www.sashahuber.com/">Sasha Huber</a> landed by helicopter near the peak of the Agassizhorn mountain in Switzerland. She was carrying a metal plaque which she hammered into the ice, symbolically renaming the mountain Rentyhorn in honour of a Congolese-born slave, <a href="https://autograph.org.uk/blog/who-was-renty-taylor-honouring-and-recalling-7-stories-of-black-liberation-struggles">Renty Taylor</a>, who had spent most of his life in captivity on a plantation in the US state of South Carolina. “As an artist,” says Huber, “I wanted to investigate Switzerland’s involvement in the slave trade, because nobody taught us that history.”</p><p>The previous year, Huber had joined a committee of activists, historians and artists involved in a campaign called Demounting Louis Agassiz. Their aim was to remove the name of the eminent 19th-century Swiss geologist and glaciologist not just from the mountain, but from the many sites around the globe that honour him. As such, their actions prefigured the widespread interrogation of historical monuments, sites and statues that accompanied the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. In 2015, Huber found out that a statue of Agassiz at Stanford University had been upended during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. She subsequently created three protest posters based on photographs of the toppled statue, to address police brutality against black people and call for the removal of statues that honour figures linked to racism.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/nov/21/swiss-mountain-agassiz-agassizhorn-racist-sasha-huber-hitler-enslaved">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From so bad it made you wince to so iconic you couldn’t stop laughing, here are your decidedly mixed feelings about the latest season of the royal drama</p><p>The series left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The praise of Charles, contrasted with the criticism of Diana, felt almost like the result of a negotiation between our new king and the showrunners. I found myself laughing out loud at several moments, but the most iconic moment for me was episode five, The Way Ahead. It is naturally critical of Charles vis-a-vis “Tampongate”, but ends with effectively an advert for the monarchy: Charles giving a speech at the Prince’s Trust, waxing lyrical about how he, too, has been the subject of criticism. The narrative standstill for the sake of fluffing one man’s reputation is laughable, and I thought it couldn’t get any better. Then he started breakdancing. I couldn’t believe it. Breakdancing! I like to think that King Charles sent a letter to the writers stipulating “you can say whatever you like about that phone call, but make sure to end with a post-credit scene about the one-point-whatever billion pounds my trust raised. Then show me breakdancing.” <strong>Benjamin, 24, PhD student, Bristol</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/21/he-started-breakdancing-i-couldnt-believe-it-your-verdicts-on-the-crown">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>O2 Shepherd’s Bush Empire, London</strong><br />Though touring his straight-up rock album Songs Without Jokes, the New Zealand comic can’t help but stray into his customary funny-haha habitat</p><p>As one half of New Zealand’s self-proclaimed “fourth-most-popular guitar-based digi-bongo a cappella-rap-funk-comedy duo” and a composer of tunes from the likes of the Muppets and the Simpsons, Flight of the Conchords’ Bret McKenzie is best known for singing songs laden with jokes. It might come as a surprise to some, then, that his debut solo album – released earlier this year – offers quite the opposite experience. Titled, categorically, Songs Without Jokes, it’s a collection of road trip-ready rock numbers inspired by the likes of Harry Nilsson and Steely Dan, with McKenzie pairing rich horn and piano arrangements with lyrics about lost love, LA and environmental disaster. We’re not talking Father John Misty levels of west coast-based existential crisis, but it’s also decidedly <em>not</em> a comedy record.</p><p>Ending a three-month tour that’s taken in his home country and the US, this one-off UK show sees McKenzie and his six-piece band (plus two Horne Section members) pair these new troubadour delights with material from the Conchords and other assorted comedic projects. He describes it as “a variety show” but, initially at least, it’s a bit of a hard sell. The chugging blues of Too Young (For All This Shit) and the 80s pop stylings of Dave’s Place are more than listenable – the latter given heft by droning synth and sax – but what are they doing next to a (really quite hilarious) Muppets movie song that McKenzie bagged an Oscar for in 2011, delivered in his best Kermit voice?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/21/bret-mckenzie-review-flight-of-the-conchords-comic-goes-beyond-funny">Continue reading...</a>

French film-maker who challenged the primacy of narration and orthodox  notions of realism<p>Jean-Marie Straub, who has died aged 89, and his wife, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2006/oct/18/guardianobituaries.france" title="Danile Huillet obituary">Danièle Huillet</a>, worked together as film-makers for more than 30 years. Straub-Huillet, as they were often called by French critics, broke away from accepted notions of realism, disengaged from bourgeois values and questioned the primacy of narration.</p><p>Their films were almost exclusively taken from pre-existing texts, whether from literature, theatre or music. The principal stylistic devices were a usually static camera, sometimes with a pan or tracking shot lasting up to several minutes, the use of non-professionals as actors and direct sound, to the extent that background noises and even wind rustling on a microphone were retained. The pair’s intention, they stated, was to teach people “how to think, see and hear”. Straub was notoriously critical of “lazy” viewers unwilling or unable to engage with his films.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/21/jean-marie-straub-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Kings Place, London</strong><br />The composer and multi-instrumentalist is joined by a single saxophonist, reinterpreting her mesmerising soundscapes as delicate duets</p><p>Eiko Ishibashi is a composer and multi-instrumentalist who wears many hats. Over the last decade and a half we’ve heard her recording left-field music with such avant-rock luminaries as Jim O’Rourke and Keiji Haino; making ear-grating prog-punk with Tatsuya Yoshida from Ruins; crooning low-volume ambient ballads on the album Carapace; singing over angular jazz-rock on Car and Freezer; experimenting with musique concrète and electronica on Satellite; and recording Nils Frahm-ish piano solos on I’m Armed. And that’s just a small selection of her output.</p><p>Tonight she wears yet another hat: that of the film composer, playing an hour-long suite of songs based on her soundtrack to the multiple-Oscar-nominated, Palme d’Or-winning movie <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/14/drive-my-car-review-hamaguchi-murakami">Drive My Car</a>. Each composition is turned into a duet between herself and the alto saxophonist Kei Matsumaru. It’s an interesting twist, given that there aren’t any saxophones on the original soundtrack, but Matsumaru has a soft, sighing, vibratoless delivery that often sounds like a flute, or even a string section, which fits many of these tracks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/21/eiko-ishibashi-review-tantalising-reworking-of-drive-my-car-soundtrack">Continue reading...</a>

They plan to move in together soon</p><p>In 2016, finding love was the last thing on Andy’s mind. A scuba diving accident four years earlier had left him with a spinal cord injury, and his primary focus was recovery. “I am from Curaçao and there isn’t much social security here, so I’d moved back in with my parents for support,” he says. “I spent my time blogging about life with disability and I set up a business selling lanterns made from recycled cans, to make some extra money.”</p><p>That December, Andy was invited to a Christmas fair to sell his products. After he set up his stall, he saw a woman behind him, who had arrived late. “Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed she was bloody gorgeous,” he says.

<p>The drama started three months ago with spyware allegations. Now it prompts a big question: where does power really lie?</p><p>It’s been three months, and Greece has been embroiled in one of its greatest political crises in recent memory. It began as a wiretapping scandal. In August, two members of Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/28/greek-watergate-phone-tapping-scandal-threatens-to-topple-pm">tendered their resignation</a> following reports that the phones of a financial journalist and a rival politician had been sent links to spyware designed to whisk their data away to a shadowy company in Athens. Greece’s press dubbed it the country’s Watergate. “Mr Mitsotakis must give explanations to the Greek people,” <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/elections/news/greek-government-rocked-by-more-resignations-over-phone-spying-claims/">said Alexis Tsipras</a>, the head of Greece’s opposition. “A lot of our questions remain to be answered,” the leader of a European parliament committee said, after a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/4/mep-urge-greece-to-investigate-spyware-scandal-more">fact-finding mission to Greece</a>.</p><p>Then, earlier this month, events took a stunning turn. A leftist newspaper called <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/greece-spyware-scandal-cybersecurity/">Documento</a><em><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/greece-spyware-scandal-cybersecurity/"> </a></em><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/greece-spyware-scandal-cybersecurity/">claimed</a> that, in addition to the two Greeks already known to have been targeted, attempts had also been made to sweep up dozens more into the spyware net. They included Mitsotakis’s own cabinet members, newspaper editors and the wife of the governor of Attica. A week later, Documento<em> </em>released nearly 40 additional names. The paper accused the government of involvement – it strongly denied the accusations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/21/oligarch-prime-minister-greece-spyware-allegations">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A rich, deep sauce that’s a perfect match for ribbon pasta</p><p>Sometimes, on a Saturday morning, we drive to <a href="https://gattiantonelli.it/#hello">Gatti &amp; Antonelli</a>. It is one of Rome’s numerous <em>pasta all’uovo</em> (fresh egg pasta) shops, and it is certainly one of the best. It’s a handsome space, with a long, marble counter, a window on to the back workshop, bright yellow signs with timings and prices, and two shelves that display eggs and a large collection of small ornamental chickens. When my son was small, it was one of the few occasions I didn’t mind his shouting, because he voiced what I felt: “Chickens! Look at the chickens! Can I hold one?” This scene reminded me of scenes from my own childhood: staring at the lines of ornaments at my grandma’s house and thinking they were treasures, then being allowed to hold a little elephant, which I squeezed so it brought me luck.</p><p>Decades beyond my squeezing and years on from my son’s shouting, we now choose which chicken we would hold – the one with the gold neck, or the white one that looks like an egg? – while we wait in line. Behind the marble counter, which is veined like cheese, two women in white coats and blue hairnets serve efficiently, lifting long and short pasta from shallow boxes into stiff paper trays – tortellini, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnolotti">agnolotti</a>, ravioli, fettuccine, tonnarelli, pappardelle.

<p>Meditative drama follows non-professional leads playing a farming couple being driven from their home in the Andean plateau by global heating</p><p>Bolivian director Alejandro Loayza Grisi started his career as a photographer then turned to cinematography; now he makes his feature debut with this slow and beautiful-looking drama set high on the Andean plateau. It’s a film that unfolds at such a measured pace that at times it felt to me like a piece of cinematic mindfulness or a concentration training exercise. I wouldn’t have been surprised if a voiceover gently interrupted proceedings, like a mindfulness app, to gently instruct us not to let our thoughts wander.</p><p>Utama opens with the staggeringly gorgeous image of an elderly man walking towards the sun rising golden over mountains. This is Virginio (José Calcina), whose weathered face is as cracked as the earth beneath his feet. Virginio spends his days tramping across the plain grazing his flock of fluffy llamas; he and his wife Sisa (Luisa Quispe) live without running water or power. They are a couple in real life, non-professionals discovered by Grisi as he drove around scouting locations. You can see that closeness in every gesture, in Sisa’s arthritic fingers tenderly patting her husband’s hand.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/21/utama-review-gentle-study-of-bolivian-family-facing-the-end-of-their-way-of-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The BBC correspondent unpicks a lifetime of trauma and compulsion that damaged him – but also brought him success</p><p>“It took 20 years,” writes Fergal Keane in <em>The Madness</em><em>, </em>“before I came to the point of accepting I was addicted to war.” It was a bitter realisation for the Irish journalist. Feted for his decades of reporting at the sharp end of disaster, Keane built a career on his capacity to take in the worst of human nature – and keep going. Until one day, tormented by his experience of the Rwandan genocide, he couldn’t keep going any longer. This book<em> </em>tells the story of how Keane began to unpick a lifetime of trauma, addiction and fear, traits that made him an alcoholic, a mental wreck – and a star.</p><p>Keane made his name writing back from distant war zones: Kosovo, Iraq, Ukraine. But growing up in 1960s Ireland, bloodshed was never far away. The Irish war of independence had ended in 1921, 40 years before his birth. As a child, it was present everywhere, Keane recalls: in family stories and public memorials, in culture, politics – and the brewing conflict in the north. All were seeds carefully planted, Keane thinks. War – or a romanticised idea of it – made him who he was.</p><p><em>The Madness: A Memoir of War, Fear and PTSD</em> by Fergal Keane is published by HarperCollins (£22).

<p>A laddish Britcom about trawlermen planning a heist while on shore leave has plenty of camaraderie but not enough sense of what’s at stake</p><p>“Welcome fuckers, to Grimsby.” That’s fisherman Curly (ex Corrie actor James Burrows), giving it large, talking straight to camera near the start of this laddish British heist comedy. It’s a lairy, offputting scene, and a few too many like it make Three Day Millionaire charmless at times, and difficult to warm to.</p><p>Curly is one of the few remaining trawler crew working out of Grimsby, once the world’s biggest fishing port. His plan for a three-day leave on shore is to blow his wages on a marathon binge with his two best mates: bleach-haired amphetamine addict Codge (Michael Kinsey), and gormless Budgie (Sam Glen), who’s only got a job because his mum’s shagging the boss. (Female characters here mostly exist to be shagged.) But bad news awaits Curly on shore. The company is being sold off. Developers are sniffing around the docks with plans for gentrifying the area, which means Curly is heading for the job centre or a zero hours contract selling “overpriced muffins” and “shite coffee”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/21/three-day-millionaire-review-grimsby-james-burrows">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The player whose penalty ultimately took the Socceroos to the World Cup on his incredible journey from Kenya to Qatar</p><p>Awer Mabil’s extraordinary story begins in the Kakuma refugee camp, Kenya, but he doesn’t want it to end there. He doesn’t want your pity, either. Born to parents fleeing the Sudanese civil war, raised in a small hut, he went half way round the world then half way back again to become a professional footballer in Denmark, Portugal, Tukey and Spain. He is, he points out, one of only four Australians to score in the Champions League and now he’s going to the World Cup. In fact, it was his penalty, at sudden death in the playoff, that ultimately took the country there.</p><p>He has become a hero and, he hopes, an inspiration, embarked upon a hell of a journey against the odds. After all, he says: “When you come to Europe from Australia you’re nobody, you don’t have the respect, so you have to really work, fight.” But he knows that is not the part people usually focus on; instead his origins in Kakuma eclipse all else. And that, he admits, “starts to piss me off a lot”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/21/australias-awer-mabil-football-has-been-my-lifes-guide">Continue reading...</a>

## It’s not just Qatar hoping we now ‘put politics aside’. It’s the hypocritical west, too | Nesrine Malik

<p>By all means boycott the football, but we could also follow the trail of gifts, property and arms deals closer to home </p><p>The 2022 World Cup was supposed to herald the arrival of Qatar, already an economic powerhouse, into the international arena as a legitimate cultural and political player. But so far, the opposite has happened. In an epic backfiring, all it seems to have achieved is focusing attention on the country’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/14/stadiums-of-shame-the-numbers-world-cup-hosts-qatar-dont-want-to-be-seen">abusive treatment</a> of migrant workers and repression of LGBTQ+ people and women. Everything in Sunday’s opening ceremony – which the BBC remarkably chose not to broadcast, focusing instead on all that was wrong with Qatar 2022 – felt coloured by the buildup, precipitating an overall sense of enforced joyfulness. Even the generic welcoming words from the Qatari sovereign felt pared-back and pointed.</p><p>On the face of it, the frenzy around this tournament has been the rare triumph of a human rights issue “cutting through” to the public. There’s just something about how the bid came about that put people off: it looked like money bending the world to its will, with the event being held in winter – in the middle of the European football season – and the use of cheap, exploited labour to build the facilities. Recent headlines including a World Cup ambassador describing homosexuality as a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/08/qatar-world-cup-ambassador-homosexuality">damage in the mind</a>” and the sight of a Danish journalist being <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-63655870">forced off air</a>, while broadcasting in a public space, seemed to confirm all this. High-profile footballers such as the former Bayern Munich and Germany player <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/nov/15/world-cup-qatar-damaged-football-philipp-lahm">Philipp Lahm</a> have said they will not be attending, while the Lionesses’ captain, Leah Williamson, has said she hasn’t “any interest” in such a compromised contest. Major European cities including Barcelona and Paris are not broadcasting matches in public places, and David Beckham, an ambassador for the event, came under intense pressure to withdraw from the proceedings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/21/qatar-world-cup-british-double-standards-anger-gifts-property-arms-deals">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Who wouldn’t want to live rent-free in a nice warm home in return for looking after the owner’s pets and keeping burglars away?</p><p>Massive houses, expansive gardens, occasionally a fridge full of food – and all of it free. Megan Gay and Sean Wood, both 27, have managed to dodge the cost of living crisis and the rent or mortgage hikes that are ravaging many people’s lives and savings in the UK. Their trick? Full-time housesitting. Seven months ago, the couple decided to quit London’s rental market and go on the road. Their belongings in bags, they have moved from house to house across the UK. They plan to continue living like this for at least another year.</p><p>Housesitting – taking care of properties and pets for nothing while owners are away – is not new. But since the pandemic, the trend has boomed. Confronted with an unstable housing market, inflation at a 40-year high and soaring food and energy costs, increasing numbers of people of all ages and walks of life are turning to housesitting to keep a roof over their heads.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/21/housesitters-escaping-the-cost-of-living-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Russian forces launched almost 400 strikes in Ukraine’s east on Sunday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy says; UN nuclear watchdog to assess Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after renewed shelling</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">See all our Ukraine coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>Russian forces launched almost 400 strikes on Sunday in Ukraine’s east as part of a campaign of artillery fire</strong>, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Sunday night <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/cogorich-svit-pobachiv-yakim-vagomim-ye-vnesok-ukrayinciv-u-79305">address</a>. “The fiercest battles, as before, are in the Donetsk region. Although there were fewer attacks today due to worsening weather, the amount of Russian shelling unfortunately remains extremely high,” Zelenskiy said. “In the Luhansk region, we are slowly moving forward while fighting. As of now, there have been almost 400 artillery attacks in the east since the start of the day.” Russia has moved troops to reinforce positions in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions after withdrawing from Kherson.</p><p><strong>The UN nuclear watchdog will conduct an assessment of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant</strong> on Monday after the site was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/20/shelling-of-zaporizhzhia-is-playing-with-fire-says-un-nuclear-chief-ukraine">shelled more than a dozen times over the weekend</a>. The blasts damaged buildings and equipment, though none had been “critical” for nuclear safety and security, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Its head, Rafael Grossi, said the forces behind the shelling were “playing with fire”, adding that “it must stop immediately”.</p><p><strong>Germany has offered Poland the Patriot missile defence system to help it to secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed in the country last week</strong>, the defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, said. “We have offered Poland support in securing airspace – with our Eurofighters and with Patriot air defence systems,” Lambrecht told the Rheinische Post and General Anzeiger. Ground-based air defence systems such as Raytheon’s Patriot are built to intercept incoming missiles.</p><p><strong>Ukraine has denies its forces executed Russian prisoners of war</strong>, arguing its soldiers were defending themselves against Russians who feigned surrender. The Ukrainian parliament’s commissioner for human rights responded on Sunday to videos circulated on Russian social media this week purporting to show the bodies of Russian servicemen killed after surrendering to Ukrainian troops. Ukrainian ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said “excerpts” of a video showed that Russians “using a staged capture ... committed a war crime by opening fire on the Ukrainian armed forces”. This means the soldiers “cannot be considered prisoners of war”, he said. A UN spokesperson told AFP it was “aware of the videos” and was “looking into them”.</p><p><strong>Negotiating with Russia would be “capitulation”, a key adviser to the Ukrainian presidency has said.</strong> Mykhaylo Podolyak said attempts by the west to urge Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow were “bizarre” given a series of major military victories by Kyiv. He added it would mean that a country “that recovers its territories must capitulate to the country that is losing”. The comments come after recent US media reports that some senior officials were beginning to encourage Ukraine to consider talks.</p><p><strong>The first Ukrainian supermarket has opened in Kherson since the city was liberated earlier this month.</strong> ATB, a 24/7 shop in the city, had queues of people outside on Sunday as it welcomed customers back. Kherson <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/20/the-russians-have-gone-now-kherson-faces-a-relentless-new-enemy-winter">remains without electricity, running water or heating</a>, but residents found some relief in being able to purchase Ukrainian pickled gherkins, dumplings, horseradish and other favourites.</p><p><strong>France has sent another two air defence systems to Ukraine,</strong> along with two multiple rocket launchers, according to an interview given by a French defence minister.</p><p><strong>Emmanuel Macron has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/20/emmanuel-macron-accuses-russia-of-feeding-disinformation-in-africa">accused Russia of feeding disinformation </a>to further its “predatory project” in Africa</strong>, where France has had military setbacks. In an <a href="https://information.tv5monde.com/video/emmanuel-macron-tv5monde-la-france-accueillera-le-prochain-sommet-de-la-francophonie">interview with TV5 Monde</a> on the sidelines of a conference of Francophone nations in Tunisia, the French president said there was a “predatory project” pushing disinformation into African countries, which was “a political project financed by Russia, sometimes others”. Macron said: “A number of powers, who want to spread their influence in Africa, are doing this to hurt France, hurt its language, sow doubts, but above all pursue certain interests.”</p><p><br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-271of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
