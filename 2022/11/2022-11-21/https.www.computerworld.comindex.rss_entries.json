The patch was urgent enough to be released outside the normal \u201cPatch Tuesday\u201d security updates released the second Tuesday of every month.</p><p>But recently Microsoft has been releasing out-of-band updates that fix issues that were introduced with the monthly security updates. Often people install the monthly security updates without realizing that there are additional ways that Microsoft fixes issues introduced by its patches.</p><p>Because Windows 10 and 11 updates are cumulative, when you install an update it\u2019s an all or nothing deployment. There is no way to install some components of the update without installing all of it. Depending on where the underlying problem with a patch lies, Microsoft can use either an out-of-band update or a Known Issue Rollback to introduce a fix to the system. Let\u2019s explore both of these methods.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3680574/out-of-band-windows-updates-and-known-issue-rollbacks-explained.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.computerworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/3680448/what-amazon-twitter-meta-and-others-got-wrong-with-layoffs.html#tk.rss_all", "title": "What Amazon, Twitter, Meta, and others got wrong with layoffs", "date_published": "2022-11-21 11:00:00+00:00", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p>Twitter, Stripe, Coinbase, Salesforce, Zendesk, Tesla, Meta, and others have <a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3679733/tech-layoffs-in-2022-a-timeline.html\">announced significant layoffs in recent months</a>, even though unemployment rates are among the lowest in 50 years.</p><p>Facebook parent company <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/mark-zuckerberg-layoff-message-to-employees/amp/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Meta announced last week it would cut 13% of its staff</a>\u00a0or 11,000 workers, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying he\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/10/meta-ecommerce-boom-stalls/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">overestimated\u00a0how long the pandemic\u2019s e-commerce boom would last</a>.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3680448/what-amazon-twitter-meta-and-others-got-wrong-with-layoffs.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>", "favourite": false}]
