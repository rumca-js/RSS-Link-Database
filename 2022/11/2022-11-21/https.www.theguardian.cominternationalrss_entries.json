Since the suit has remained in style for over a century, enduring in both fashion and popular culture as a symbol of elegance, this is particularly sage advice.</p><p>A properly tailored suit has the added benefit of being universally flattering. In terms of clothing, suits have a distinct ability to accentuate the good parts of a figure, hide what needs to be hidden and create balance in between.

It\u2019s been more than 24 hours since Twitter\u2019s new owner <strong>Elon Musk</strong> allowed <strong>Donald Trump</strong> to return to the platform, and the former president hasn\u2019t said a word. You would think Trump has plenty on his mind, considering his announcement last week that he will run for the White House in 2024, even as his legal situation is looking perilous after the justice department appointed a special counsel to handle two criminal investigations into his conduct. But the day is just beginning, and perhaps Trump will make his return in the hours ahead.</p><p>Here\u2019s what else is happening today:</p><p><strong>Joe Biden</strong> pardons the Thanksgiving turkey at 11.15am eastern time, marking the 75th anniversary of this most American of traditions.

Although there were fewer attacks today due to worsening weather, the amount of Russian shelling unfortunately remains extremely high,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cIn the Luhansk region, we are slowly moving forward while fighting. As of now, there have been almost 400 artillery attacks in the east since the start of the day.\u201d Russia has moved troops to reinforce positions in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions after withdrawing from Kherson.</p><p><strong>The UN nuclear watchdog will conduct an assessment of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant</strong> on Monday after the site was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/20/shelling-of-zaporizhzhia-is-playing-with-fire-says-un-nuclear-chief-ukraine\">shelled more than a dozen times over the weekend</a>. The blasts damaged buildings and equipment, though none had been \u201ccritical\u201d for nuclear safety and security, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Its head, Rafael Grossi, said the forces behind the shelling were \u201cplaying with fire\u201d, adding that \u201cit must stop immediately\u201d.</p><p><strong>Germany has offered Poland the Patriot missile defence system to help it to secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed in the country last week</strong>, the defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, said. \u201cWe have offered Poland support in securing airspace \u2013 with our Eurofighters and with Patriot air defence systems,\u201d Lambrecht told the Rheinische Post and General Anzeiger.

The Ukrainian parliament\u2019s commissioner for human rights responded on Sunday to videos circulated on Russian social media this week purporting to show the bodies of Russian servicemen killed after surrendering to Ukrainian troops. Ukrainian ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said \u201cexcerpts\u201d of a video showed that Russians \u201cusing a staged capture ... committed a war crime by opening fire on the Ukrainian armed forces\u201d. This means the soldiers \u201ccannot be considered prisoners of war\u201d, he said. A UN spokesperson told AFP it was \u201caware of the videos\u201d and was \u201clooking into them\u201d.</p><p><strong>Negotiating with Russia would be \u201ccapitulation\u201d, a key adviser to the Ukrainian presidency has said.</strong> Mykhaylo Podolyak said attempts by the west to urge Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow were \u201cbizarre\u201d given a series of major military victories by Kyiv. He added it would mean that a country \u201cthat recovers its territories must capitulate to the country that is losing\u201d.
