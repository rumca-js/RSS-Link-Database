Do you have a gaming PC, an Xbox, a PlayStation, and a Switch, and somehow only have twenty bucks to spare for audio equipment? Then do I have a deal for you, and very specifically you, incredibly conditional reader! Best Buy is selling the Astro Gaming A10, a wired headset that works with pretty much everything, for $40 off. Since it was already fairly budget-friendly at $60, that <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fastro-gaming-a10-wired-stereo-over-the-ear-gaming-headset-for-pc-xbox-playstation-and-nintendo-switch-with-flip-to-mute-mic-black-red%2F6224200.p%3FskuId%3D6224200&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">makes the final price just $20</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Astro A10 gets around iffy compatibility issues by using an old-fashioned headphone jack, making it compatible with more or less every platform: PC and Switch users can plug it in directly, while Xbox and PlayStation users can plug headsets into their controllers. You can also use it with most phones, though some newer models will require a USB-C (Android) or Lightning (iPhone) cable adapter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Astro A10 isn&rsquo;t fancy. It uses basic 40mm stereo drivers that are compatible with Dolby Audio and not much else. But the integrated mic boom can be tilted up to automatically mute it. The cable is six feet/two meters, which should be fine for most players. The headset comes in a standard black with red trim color, but you can also get it in <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fastro-gaming-a10-wired-stereo-over-the-ear-gaming-headset-for-xbox-series-xs-xbox-one-with-flip-to-mute-mic-black-green%2F5892993.p%3FskuId%3D5892993&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox black/green</a> or <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fastro-gaming-a10-wired-stereo-over-the-ear-gaming-headset-for-ps4-ps5-with-flip-to-mute-mic-white-blue%2F6369453.p%3FskuId%3D6369453&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\">PlayStation white/blue</a>.

Lo and behold, <em>le fils prodigue revient</em>: as of yesterday, Ubisoft has <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2208920/Assassins_Creed_Valhalla/&amp;xcust=2-2-1389252-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">posted <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed Valhalla</em></a> to Valve&rsquo;s ubiquitous storefront with a December 6th release date. It will follow with <em>Anno 1800 </em>and<em> Roller Champions </em>at some point. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ubisoft is the latest huge publisher to venture out on its own with its a PC-based game launcher, then return to Steam&rsquo;s profitable fold. Ubisoft&rsquo;s brand of bloatware was called Uplay, which became the exclusive home of the publisher&rsquo;s major franchises in 2019, and was rechristened Ubisoft Connect in 2020. EA and Activision pulled similar moves in an attempt to loosen Steam&rsquo;s stranglehold on PC game sales, and eventually returned to the store as well. Perhaps having a viable, cross-company alternative in the Epic Games Store has made Steam more appealing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed Valhalla</em> was released a little over two years ago, and <em>Anno 1800 </em>is even older, though Ubisoft&rsquo;s upcoming Steam titles are a little more recent. The multiplayer esports hopeful <em>Roller Champions</em> got a final release in May. Presumably the company will be using a multi-store approach going forward. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re constantly evaluating how to bring our games to different audiences wherever they are, while providing a consistent player ecosystem through Ubisoft Connect,&rdquo; a Ubisoft representative <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/21/23471589/ubisoft-return-steam-2022-assassins-creed-valhalla&amp;xcust=2-2-1389252-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">told The Verge</a>, apparently trying to grind for some kind of achievement for the most vague PR statement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were hoping to reduce the number of launchers on your PC, too bad. The new Steam games still require Ubisoft Connect to be installed, even if the games themselves are purchased through Steam&rsquo;s marketplace system. At least this should make it easier to access some games on the Linux-based SteamOS (through the Proton system), and by extension, the portable Steam Deck. </p>\nGaming</div>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1389227/grab-this-lg-1440p-gaming-monitor-for-134-before-black-friday.html", "title": "Early Black Friday stunner: Grab this 32-inch 1440p monitor for just $134", "date_published": "2022-11-22 15:33:32+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section><p>Black Friday is a fantastic time to buy a discounted monitor.

One reason: Instead of three downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports, it drops one in favor of an HDMI 2.1 port. That&rsquo;s a clear concession to the PC market, versus the Thunderbolt-dependent Mac market, and it&rsquo;s a plus in our book. Downstream power via the host Thunderbolt 4 port slightly increases, from a rated 90W to 96W, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Note: This review is part of our ongoing roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html\">best Thunderbolt docks</a>. Go there to learn about competing products, what to look for in a Thunderbolt dock, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In total, the SD5780T offers four USB-A ports (including one optimized for smartphone charging, two USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports for downstream connectivity, plus an HDMI 2.1 port, a 2.5Gb ethernet port, an SD4.0 UHS-II SD card slot (though not a microSD card slot), and a 3.5mm jack for a mic and headphone. Like the SD5700T, the dock includes a small power button and LEDs that light when the dock is powered and connected. The Thunderbolt 4 cord is about 38.5 inches, nice and roomy.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Kensington SD5780T Thunderbolt 4 4K Dock\" class=\"wp-image-1386241\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kensington-SD5780T-rear.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>The rear ports of Kensington&rsquo;s  SD5780T Thunderbolt 4 Dual 4K Dock.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, Kensington also includes a pair of Kensington lock slots as well, which are found on the side of the docking station.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kensington supplies no dedicated USB-C ports on the SD5780T, but that&rsquo;s not necessarily a negative. For one, the front-mounted USB-A port supplies 1.5A for charging (not fast-charging) a smartphone. But the two other downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports provide 3A of current, which can fast-charge a smartphone, if your phone charging cable uses USB-C.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, the single HDMI 2.1 port will power an external 4K monitor at up to 120Hz if just a single display is used. Adding a second display probably requires a specialized, additional purchase, either a USB-C dongle or a specialized cable. I was only able to push 30Hz to an external display if connected to one of several USB-C dongles on my desk. Using a specialized Thunderbolt-to-HDMI cable (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075V5JK36&amp;xcust=2-2-1384482-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">$18 on Amazon</a>) my laptop was able to push a 60Hz to the second display, which will be more comfortable on your eyes. But if all that is too much of a hassle, you might want to buy a Thunderbolt dock with multiple display ports that you can just plug cables into, instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Physically, the Kensington SD5780T sits flat on your desk, measuring 7.7 x 2.95 x 1.2 inches and 0.95 pounds, with no vertical stand. (It ships with a relatively massive 180W power supply that will keep it tethered to your desk, however.) The chassis is made of an attractive brushed aluminum, which helps eliminate any heat concerns. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Kensington SD5780T Thunderbolt 4 4K Dock\" class=\"wp-image-1386242\" height=\"743\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kenisngton-SD5780T-lock-slots.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Kensington locks on a Kensington device? Of course.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Our tests showed that the SD5780T came close to delivering its rated power. Our tests indicated that it generated 90W downstream to a connected laptop (versus a rated 96W), and delivered 1.5A charging power off of the front USB-A port, as expected. The rear ports fell a bit short, however, delivering about 0.55A, when the rated amperage was 0.9A. That means it will deliver less power for charging smartphones and powering external devices then you might expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a performance standpoint, the SD5780T dock performed very well when streaming a 4K60 video, dropping just a few frames. Connecting an external SSD via the downstream Thunderbolt 4 port initially generated a weird error, where the laptop was unable to find the directory. It has no issues when reconnecting it in the future, however. Copying 2.5GB of data across the downstream Thunderbolt 4 port to the laptop, while streaming, dropped a frame or two but without noticeable stuttering&mdash;a smooth performance, and what you would hope to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our conclusion? The SD5780T met our expectations, and then some. The price, though, gives us pause. If you can afford $350, Kensington&rsquo;s SD5780T Thunderbolt 4 Dual 4K Dock is worth it.

Today&rsquo;s deal may be the most eye-catching example. Walmart is selling the GeForce RTX 3060-powered <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/836840444&amp;xcust=2-2-1389172-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acer Nitro 5 gaming laptop for just $649</a>, a ludicrously low price for a notebook with that GPU inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get excited when we see RTX 3060 laptops on sale for $800 or even $900. At $650, this is an insta-buy if you&rsquo;re looking for a gaming laptop that won&rsquo;t break the bank. It&rsquo;s hard enough to find <em>any</em> gaming notebooks going for this cheap and when you do, they virtually always pack a substantially weaker RTX 3050 or 3050 Ti GPU. The GeForce RTX 3060 lets you crank a game&rsquo;s eye candy to 11 and still hit the hallowed 60 frames-per-second mark (or higher!), especially in titles that support Nvidia&rsquo;s vaunted DLSS technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acer slapped a blistering 144Hz 1080p display on this puppy, so you&rsquo;ll enjoy buttery smooth frame rates while you&rsquo;re working towards prestige in <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em>. An AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, 8GB of memory, and a 512GB NVMe SSD round out the package and will deliver plenty of speed to keep pace with the speedy RTX 3060.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Black Friday isn&rsquo;t even here yet but this could be the best Black Friday gaming laptop deal you&rsquo;ll see this year.

The then-brand-new Core i9-12900K would idle cores when the mouse wasn&rsquo;t being moved, but move it just a little and bam! Cores spike up to 100 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second problem related to a completely different system: A new Core i5-13600KF on a Z790 motherboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During file transfers from that system&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393496/samsung-980-pro-nvme-ssd-review.html\">Samsung 980 Pro SSD</a> to a larger hard drive, the file transfers would eventually stall out and never finish. This despite no problems copying from a USB key to the desktop. New drivers, removing and reinstalling devices from the device manager, and pulling drives all made no difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would spend an hour or so trying to trouble shoot each problem with no success but you know the one easy trick that would I&rsquo;m certain would have prevented these problems?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Installing a clean copy of Windows in those new builds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I&rsquo;ll say that again: Installing a fresh copy of Windows on any new PC would have 100 percent eliminated these issues.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows key\" class=\"wp-image-1353552\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/windows-key.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><a class=\"imageCredit\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://unsplash.com/photos/BStW5kYXw4E&amp;xcust=2-1-1382822-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">freestocks/Unsplash</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>How do I know? I know because the two situations I mentioned above aren&rsquo;t my own tech support nightmares, but two friends who casually asked for my help assessing &ldquo;some weirdness in their new builds.&rdquo; Both started over text messaging with the usual 20 questions. Did you update drivers? Did you do this? Did you do that? No change? How about this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally I asked the first friend what I assumed was a rhetorical question: &ldquo;This is a clean install of Windows right?&rdquo; After a very long pause, the person sheepishly ponied up the truth that no, the OS drive was simply unplugged from the older 10th-gen Intel system and plugged into the new 12th-gen Intel build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look, I get it. It&rsquo;s easy and it can work just fine&mdash;but in this case it wasn&rsquo;t, and the system&rsquo;s&nbsp;truly bewildering behavior made zero sense and had me scratching my head for an answer. Once I learned that it was an OS drive swap from an older system, I simply recommended a clean install and washed my hands of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, I could recommend uninstalling all existing drivers, running a driver removal program, trying to reboot, and then installing the latest drivers to see if it would clean it up&mdash;but I had had it. Rather than being told from the get go that it was a self-created tech support issue, I had to guess 40 times what was wrong before getting to the truth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months later, however, I heard from a second friend who had the odd file transfer stalling issue mentioned above. You guessed it&mdash;25 text messages and video proof of the file transfer stalling later, I had to ask: &ldquo;Wait, this is a clean install right? I mean, X (<em>both my friends know each other, believe it or not</em>) wasted half my day trying to guess what his problem was and waited until the end to admit he didn&rsquo;t do a clean install.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s the same install I&rsquo;ve had for a <strong><em>few </em></strong>systems now.&rdquo; Yes, that OS install has moved not from just one box, but through several different CPUs and motherboards.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s the same install I&rsquo;ve had for a <strong><em>few </em></strong>systems now.&rdquo; Yes, that OS install has moved not from just one box, but through several different CPUs and motherboards.</p></blockquote></figure><p>My response was a two word expletive I&rsquo;m not allowed to repeat here or on broadcast TV where the FCC still has power. Minutes later I was told that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s never been an issue before.&rdquo;<br />Yes, yes, it never was an issue before, but NOW it&rsquo;s an issue and it&rsquo;s somehow my problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And frankly, if I had been told up front that it was a drive swap without a fresh Windows install, I would have simply washed my hands with the answer that a nuke and pave would be the right solution. Instead, I responded with a YouTube clip from the Michael Mann movie <em>Heat</em>, where Al Pacino eloquently tells a local chop-shop dealer not to waste his time. No, I can&rsquo;t link that scene either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both friends who had these issues are <em>not</em> rookie PC builders, mind you. Both have been in the industry, build their own PCs, and have literally built dozens and dozens of PCs. I understand why they did it. For those who just want to chill on their PC after a hard day at work, having to move your just-right OS to a new PC build is about as relaxing as moving homes.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"core-i9-13900k\">Core i9-13900K</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Core i9-13900K\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/070A9689_V31.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2000\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>In my case, I address that &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to lazy to reinstall Windows&rdquo; by just never upgrading PCs. The machine I just kicked to the curb was running Windows 8.1 on a 2nd-gen Intel CPU. And my current Intel 7th-gen Windows 10 machine, while newer, is so slow that the laptops I test are literally faster than my desktop. Even if I had the latest Ryzen 7000 or an Intel 13th-gen processor to move to (now is a great time BTW!) my main reason for not doing so is because I&rsquo;d have to move Windows too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The not-moving syndrome is actually something Microsoft has been trying to address in recent versions of Windows. Now, logging into a Microsoft account lets the OS restore applications, log-ins, and documents from your other PCs, similar to how smartphones restore apps and settings for you. The convenience, if it ever gets as good as a phone, is actually quite useful. Microsoft&rsquo;s moves aren&rsquo;t altruistic of course, because it knows if it&rsquo;s easy to move from PC to PC, you might actually buy a new PC more regularly than you do now. I look forward to that day when it all works too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime though, if you want your new PC build to work right from the get go: please, please, <strong><em>please </em></strong>install a fresh copy of the OS too. If you&rsquo;re worried about losing data, just buy a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html\">shiny new fast SSD</a> to install it to and keep the older OS safely set aside. And if you do have problems, make sure you tell the person you&rsquo;re asking for help if you did a clean install or simply transferred that drive. It&rsquo;ll make everyone&rsquo;s day go a lot smoother.</p>\nWindows</div>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1382692/best-monitors-for-graphics-design.html", "title": "The best monitors for graphic design: What you see is what you get", "date_published": "2022-11-22 11:30:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section><p>Everyone enjoys a monitor with great image quality but, for graphics designers, image quality is a professional necessity.

Asus&rsquo; ProArt PA32DC is for you.</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s get this out of the way up front: This monitor is $3,499. That&rsquo;s a lot of money, to be sure, but its quality lives up to the price. This monitor has a 4K OLED panel with tack-sharp clarity, excellent color accuracy, and a very wide color gamut covering 99 percent of DCI-P3 and 98 percent of Adobe RGB. The OLED panel also provides class-leading contrast and strong HDR support, making this an ideal choice if you work with HDR content.</p>\n\n<p>The ProArt PA32DC&rsquo;s professional focus carries over to its design. It&rsquo;s built like a tank and includes a built-in handle. You can also detach the height-adjustable stand and instead use a pair of screw-on legs that collapse flat. These unusual features might seem odd for a 32-inch monitor, but they&rsquo;ll prove handy if your work requires travel to a client&rsquo;s office or studio.</p>\n\n<p>Connectivity is superb, too, with a total of five video inputs including a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 65 watts of Power Delivery. The monitor&rsquo;s on-screen menus offer a massive range of adjustments and customization to help professionals tune the image to their work.</p>\n\n<p>This monitor is expensive, but it&rsquo;s worth it. It&rsquo;s an ideal professional display built for the most demanding graphics design work.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1072564/asus-proart-oled-pa32dc-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Asus ProArt OLED PA32DC review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"2-dell-u3223qe-best-4k-monitor-for-graphic-design\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.

It also supports a wide color gamut spanning 99 percent of DCI-P3 (though only 89 percent of Adobe RGB).

It still lacks the contrast of an OLED panel, but the contrast ratio is roughly twice that of a standard IPS panel. This is a big advantage over similarly priced competitors, most of which have a standard IPS panel with a lackluster contrast ratio.</p>\n\n<p>Connectivity is great, as well, and includes a USB-C port that powers a full-featured USB-C hub with multiple USB-A ports, ethernet, and DisplayPort-out. The USB-C port delivers 95 watts of Power Delivery for charging a connected laptop or tablet.</p>\n\n<p>Graphics designers who want a smaller monitor should consider this monitor&rsquo;s sibling, the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-27-4k-usb-c-hub-monitor-u2723qe/apd/210-bdpf/monitors-monitor-accessories#techspecs_section&amp;xcust=2-1-1382692-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dell U2723QE</a>.

It also supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro for smooth gaming. This monitor retails at an MSRP of $749.99 which, though not inexpensive, undercuts competitors with similar features. Other monitors can match the ProArt PA348CV on image quality, features, or refresh rate, but none beat it on all three.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1346674/asus-proart-pa348cgv-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Asus ProArt PA348CGV review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"4-nzxt-canvas-27q-best-budget-monitor-for-graphic-design\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4.

The NZXT Canvas 27Q is one such diamond in the rough.</p>\n\n<p>The NZXT Canvas 27Q&rsquo;s color performance is shockingly good for its price. The monitor&rsquo;s color accuracy is superb and, in fact, slightly better out-of-box than the Asus ProArt PA32DC and Dell U3223QE. The monitor also has a wide color gamut spanning 97 percent of DCI-P3. That&rsquo;s not as wide as the best graphics design monitors but, for many, it will be enough.</p>\n\n<p>This is a 27-inch monitor with a resolution of 2560&times;1440. It doesn&rsquo;t look as sharp as 4K alternatives but still appears pleasantly crisp. The monitor also supports USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode, though it doesn&rsquo;t have Power Delivery for charging a connected device.</p>\n\n<p>The monitor&rsquo;s MSRP is $339.99, but it frequently sells for just $249.99. That&rsquo;s without a stand, which adds $40 to the price. NZXT also offers an optional monitor arm that can clip to your desk. It&rsquo;s a good pickup if you plan to use the Canvas 27Q as a second monitor.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/828353/nzxt-canvas-27q-monitor-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">NZXT Canvas 27Q review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-to-look-for-in-a-monitor-for-graphics-design\">What to look for in a monitor for graphics design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A great monitor is critical for graphics design&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be spending all day staring at it, after all. Many monitors can do the job, but the best graphics design monitors have specific traits that set them apart from monitors that are great for 4K movies, gaming, and general use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"buy-a-monitor-with-great-color-accuracy\">Buy a monitor with great color accuracy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Color accuracy is a key trait for graphics design monitors. Accurate color means that content you view on it will be a reasonably accurate example of what the same content will look like on other monitors, or when your work is sent to print.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most modern monitors deliver reasonable color accuracy, but some remain much better than others. The good news? You don&rsquo;t have to spend a fortune to see top-notch results. The NZXT Canvas 27Q, which retails for as little as $249.99 on sale, has color accuracy on par with our top pick, the $3,499.99 Asus ProArt PA32DC.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"color-gamut-is-critical\">Color gamut is critical</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the similarity in accuracy between the NZXT Canvas 27Q and Asus ProArt PA32DC may leave you scratching your head. Why pay over 10 times more for the Asus?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Color gamut is a key reason. A monitor&rsquo;s color gamut describes the range of colors that it can display. This is often measured relative to a specific, industry-standard color space, such as sRGB, DCI-P3, Rec.709, or Adobe RGB. If a monitor has a color gamut that can display 99 percent of DCI-P3, that means it can show 99 percent of all colors included in the DCI-P3 color space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s why a wider color gamut is better than a narrow color gamut. A monitor with a narrow color gamut literally can&rsquo;t display some colors, which means they won&rsquo;t appear correct on that monitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"a-high-resolution-is-preferrable\">A high resolution is preferrable&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A higher display resolution is usually preferable over a lower display resolution. A high resolution literally displays more information than a lower resolution, and that translates to more detail and the ability to see more of an image at once without zooming in. In practice, 4K is the preferable resolution for modern high-end graphics design displays, while 1440 is an acceptable alternative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The work that you do is also important. If your graphics design is centered on web design, for example, it&rsquo;s less likely you will need an extremely high resolution. Photographers, on the other hand, demand high resolutions because it reduces the zooming and scaling required when working with high-resolution DSLR (or even smartphone) photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"its-good-to-have-options\">It&rsquo;s good to have options</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The best monitors for graphics design look excellent at default settings, but graphics designers often need to tune a monitor&rsquo;s look to fit their preferences or the requirements of a client. One job may only require use of the sRGB color space, but another might require DCI-P3, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the monitors on this list provide some degree of customization, with more-expensive models generally offering more options than less-expensive alternatives. This is where the Asus ProArt PA32DC truly excels. It looks superb out-of-box, true, but can be tuned to fit a wide range of color space, gamma, and color temperature requirements. It even includes a built-in calibration tool to dial in image quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-we-test-monitors\">How we test monitors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PC World monitor reviews are written by the publication&rsquo;s staff and freelance writers. We use the SpyderXElite color calibration tool to objectively measure the brightness, contrast, color gamut, and accuracy of each monitor. Objective measurements help us directly compare the quality of dozens of monitors at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our tests consider whether a monitor supports any special features that give it an advantage. A USB-C hub that includes ethernet connectivity and USB Power Delivery is a bonus; we also like to see ergonomic stands, multiple video inputs, and a wide range of useful on-screen menu options.</p>\nMonitors</div>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1388520/save-nearly-90-off-this-heated-jacket-before-thanksgiving.html", "title": "Save nearly 90% off this heated jacket before Thanksgiving", "date_published": "2022-11-22 10:00:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section><p>Even in the toughest years, there are things to be thankful for.
