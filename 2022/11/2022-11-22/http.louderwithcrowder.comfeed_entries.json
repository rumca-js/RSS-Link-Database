Like Editor Emeritus Courtney Kirchoff, and rapper/actor <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ice-cube-trending-black-america\" target=\"_blank\">Ice Cube</a>.</p><p>Ice Cube was rumored to have turned down a NINE MILLION DOLLAR MOVIE ROLE because he refused to make the personal medical decision Hollywood wanted him to make. As Cube confirmed on the Million Dollaz Worth of Game podcast, the Fauci Ouchie mandates did in fact f*ck him with no vaseline.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble\">\n\n</p>\n<blockquote>I turned down a movie because I didn't want to get the motherf*cking jab. I turned down nine million because I didn't want to get the jab. </blockquote><p>It all seems so silly a year later, now that we know the jab didn't prevent people from getting sick AND that most if not all mandates have been rescinded. I wonder if Ice Cube has any feelings about that.</p><blockquote>F*ck that jab. And f*ck y'all for trying to make me get it. </blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d0822\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32175964&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>As originally reported by <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ice-cube-movie-walks-away\" target=\"_blank\">the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website</a>, Ice Cube was supposed to star in a movie called <em>Oh Hell No</em>. Cube had signed on to the film in June 2021 when being allowed to make personal medical decisions wasn't frowned upon. Months later, the producers answered Joe Biden's call to mandate employees do what Joe Biden wanted them to do at the time. Producers told Ice Cube that he needed to stick a needle in his arm. Cube said \"F*ck Tha Mandate\" and bounced.</p><p>I can only hope that the next time Ice Cube meets with the producer who yanked the movie deal over \"the science,\" a member of Cube's entourage has their smartphone recording. We've all seen <em>Straight Out of Compton</em>.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a30cc\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32176014&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>At least in Ice Cube's case, he's rich and has money to fall back on. Others didn't, and some of them are still unemployed because of a personal medical decision we know now they were not wrong about.</p><p>Also, Cube didn't jab AND managed to not catch schmovid either.

When I saw the feminine hygiene product trending on Twitter, I assumed it would be a campaign to market their product to people who have no biological reason to use it. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/baymax-disney-video-leaked\" target=\"_blank\">Since this is 2022</a> and it would be <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/california-menstrual-products-to-men\" target=\"_blank\">a beautiful and brave thing for them to do</a>.</p><p>I got the marketing part right. I'm not so sure who the target audience for this is though:</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">You're in their DMs. We're in them. <br />We are not the same.<br />\u2014 Tampax US (@Tampax) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tampax/status/1594719218632720385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 21, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>You're in their DMs. We're in them. <br /><br />We are not the same.<br /></blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f42ea\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32158818&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>This tweet takes the expression \"slide into their DMs,\" which is when someone will contact someone from the female persuasion via direct message to say 'Sup,\" \"You up,\" or to lay the groundwork for future sexual activity. And compares it to the fact the Tampax product is literally inserted into the person using said product. Ironically enough, in the same place a person sliding into your DMs would like to insert themselves.<br /></p><p>Unclear is what connection the two have to do with each other. Or what the target audience of this new marketing campaign is.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">I don\u2019t even have a vaginer but this post is so hip and relatable that I\u2019m going to start finding a way to use your product (anally).<br />\u2014 LOGAN (@GatoradeUser) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GatoradeUser/status/1594776970927407104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 21, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>There remains the possibility this is a rogue employee on the Tampax social media team.
