And here, on a bright warm day in November, with the clocks striking 13 minutes of injury time, there were still a few more seconds for Argentina to make things right.</p><p>Messi advanced down the right channel, nudging the ball along with impatient taps of his left outstep. A little space had opened up in front of him in the Saudi Arabia midfield. \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda was making the overlapping run on the right wing. In between him and the goal stood three defenders. Briefly, thrillingly, you could see the cogs whirring as Messi contemplated taking them all on and saving the match on his own. Instead, the pass went sideways to Di Mar\u00eda and the cross went nowhere. There is always more time.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/nov/22/lionel-messis-international-career-has-never-felt-closer-to-oblivion\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/22/south-african-president-cyril-ramaphosa-first-uk-state-visit-king-charles-reign", "title": "South African president makes first UK state visit of King Charles\u2019s reign", "date_published": "2022-11-22 16:55:49+00:00", "description": "<p>Tory government eager to focus on trade rather than Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s refusal to put sanctions on Russia</p><p>The South African president has started a two-day state visit to the UK, the first since King Charles took the throne, with the Conservative government eager to focus on trade rather than challenge South Africa\u2019s refusal to impose sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine.</p><p> Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s trip has been much delayed due to Covid and only by chance became the first state visit of the king\u2019s reign.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/22/south-african-president-cyril-ramaphosa-first-uk-state-visit-king-charles-reign\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/22/owen-paterson-taking-uk-to-human-rights-court-after-lobbying-scandal", "title": "Owen Paterson taking UK to human rights court after lobbying scandal", "date_published": "2022-11-22 16:51:41+00:00", "description": "<p>Former MP, who once argued UK should break free from Strasbourg court, is challenging finding he repeatedly broke rules</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/nov/22/keir-starmer-labour-cbi-immigration-conservatives-dominic-raab-uk-politics-latest\">UK politics live: latest news updates</a></li></ul><p>Owen Paterson, the former MP at the centre of a lobbying scandal that engulfed Boris Johnson\u2019s government, is taking the UK to the European court of human rights to challenge the finding that he repeatedly broke the rules on paid advocacy.</p><p>Paterson, a leading Brexiter who also once argued the UK should \u201cbreak free\u201d from the ECHR, filed his case on the grounds that his right to respect for private life was infringed under article 8 of the European convention on human rights.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/22/owen-paterson-taking-uk-to-human-rights-court-after-lobbying-scandal\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/22/rishi-sunak-brexit-swiss-style-deal-fury-tory-mps", "title": "The truth that Rishi Sunak dare not speak: Britain still needs the EU | Rafael Behr", "date_published": "2022-11-22 16:42:52+00:00", "description": "<p>Talk of a Swiss-style deal has put Brexit back on the agenda.

It was Monday lunchtime, not usually a time slot associated with epic b@ntz, but England supporters acting up for the cameras made it feel like this might actually be a real World Cup.

Roberto Mart\u00ednez concurs, although that is no great surprise from a master of positive spin who once described an Everton player\u2019s broken leg as \u201ca great opportunity\u201d and every set of results going against Wigan in their fight for Premier League survival as good for his players\u2019 mindset.

Just before midnight on Saturday, a man carrying multiple magazines of ammunition entered the Club Q, a gay bar in Colorado Springs, Colorado, spraying gunfire. As bullets flew, two patrons at the club subdued the attacker by grabbing the gun from him, and hitting him with it. They held him down until police arrived. The first 911 call was made at 11.56pm; the killer was taken into custody at 12.02am. But in those six minutes, five people were killed, including Daniel Aston and Derrick Rump, two men who were tending bar, and Kerry Loving, a partygoer. Eighteen were wounded. As the clock struck midnight, it became a holiday for the bar\u2019s community: Transgender Day of Remembrance, which honors trans people killed in hate attacks, was observed on Sunday.</p><p>There\u2019s a grim routine, these days, to the mass shootings in America. Some elements remain constant from shooting to shooting. Usually, the gunman is a young white man, and usually, he has a history of violence against women. There will have been mental health episodes, or previous run-ins with police. But none of this history will have stopped him from getting a gun. American mass shooters tend to use automatic or semi-automatic long guns, the kind that aren\u2019t available to civilians in other countries. Almost always, they purchased them legally.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/22/the-us-right-is-stoking-anti-lgbt-hate-this-shooting-was-no-surprise\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/22/five-legal-ideas-fight-climate-crisis-save-planet", "title": "Make ecocide an international crime and other legal ideas to help save the planet | Steven Donziger", "date_published": "2022-11-22 11:09:27+00:00", "description": "<p>A list of the five most promising legal steps we can take to help fight climate change</p><p>The world has reached an acute point in the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/07/cop27-climate-summit-un-secretary-general-antonio-guterres\">highway to climate hell</a>\u201d.

The redoubtable Sally Phillips (the Bridget Jones films, Veep) probably worked three or four days max to play put-upon working-class Sharon, mother to two variously dodgy young men, all of them living on a Bristol council estate in the 1980s. The younger brother Steve (David Perkins from Hollyoaks, a find) has a steady job working at the local butcher and boosts his income with illegal fishing, selling the catch to a local restaurant. As the film starts, he\u2019s finally saved enough scratch to buy a small Honda XL 125 motorbike, which promptly gets nicked five minutes after he drives it home and leaves it parked by his front door.</p><p>This sets in train the rest of the plot which follows Steve as he trudges around town trying to find who stole his bike, especially since the police clearly have no interest in helping when they hear he is the kid brother of Andrew Knight (Eugene Simon, Game of Thrones). Andrew is on probation, and trying to go straight with a regular job, but a short temper and a killer right hook perpetually get him in trouble. Together the two brothers traverse the local underworld: a landscape full of pubs, municipal playgrounds, and quiet sidestreets where drug dealers do a lively trade in heroin.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/22/the-fence-review-1980s-bristol-sally-phillips\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/22/world-cup-2022-qatar-virgil-van-dijk-netherlands-onelove-armband", "title": "Virgil van Dijk denies lacking \u2018backbone\u2019 over OneLove armband controversy", "date_published": "2022-11-22 08:52:32+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>Netherlands one of seven nations to back down in armband row</li><li>\u2018We just want to play football,\u2019 says Dutch captain</li></ul><p>Virgil van Dijk has hit back at claims the Netherlands and other countries have been spineless in the anti-discrimination armband controversy.</p><p>The Dutch were one of seven European nations, including England and Wales, who planned for their captains to wear the rainbow-coloured OneLove armband at the World Cup.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/22/world-cup-2022-qatar-virgil-van-dijk-netherlands-onelove-armband\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/nov/22/argentina-v-saudi-arabia-world-cup-2022-live", "title": "Argentina v Saudi Arabia: World Cup 2022 \u2013 live", "date_published": "2022-11-22 08:30:45+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>Live World Cup updates from 10am UK time</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/21/lionel-messis-world-cup-swansong-might-just-be-his-best-shot-at-glory\">Jonathan Liew: Messi\u2019s swansong may be his best shot</a></li><li>And you can <a href=\"mailto:Daniel%20Harris%20%3Cdaniel.harris.casual@theguardian.com%3E\">email Daniel</a> or tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanielHarris\">@DanielHarris</a></li></ul><p>It was once put to Juca Kfouri, the Brazilian football writer, that Zico never won the World Cup. \u201cWell,\u201d he retorted, \u201cthat\u2019s the World Cup\u2019s bad luck\u201d.</p><p>And in a way, Brazil\u2019s failure to lift the trophy in 1982 \u2013 and 1986 \u2013 actually elevates their standing, cementing them in our hearts because it\u2019s easier to identify with tragic heroes than heroic heroes.
