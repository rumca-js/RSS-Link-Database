<p>Striker is right in saying that Manchester United have made mistakes but the club’s worst error was to re-sign him</p><p>The saddest aspect of Cristiano Ronaldo’s interview with Piers Morgan was that so much of it was so accurate. He correctly identified that Manchester United has not evolved much since he left, that the club has been undermined by terrible decision-making. When historians of the future come to write of United’s post-Ferguson struggles, the transcript will provide a very useful precis. But in his diagnosis there is a blind spot: the worst decision United have made since 2013 was to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/aug/27/manchester-city-cristiano-ronaldo-wants-to-leave-juventus-allegri">re-sign him</a>.</p><p>This, perhaps, is the tragedy of the great sportsman. Ronaldo may be a preening narcissist, and ego of such overwhelming gravity that he inevitably dominates any club for whom he plays, but he has also been one of the greatest footballers of all time and is all the more remarkable for having made himself so. The comparison with Lionel Messi is hackneyed but irresistible. Messi has often seemed almost diffident, as though a great talent acts through him and he a semi‑willing conduit. Ronaldo has, with tremendous single‑mindedness and strength of will, worked and worked to transform his ability into something extraordinary.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/22/ronaldo-wanted-to-be-centre-stage-but-now-has-to-head-for-the-exit-door">Continue reading...</a>

<p>USA stunned England in 1950 while Senegal provided the first big upset of the 21st century tournaments</p><p>The biggest World Cup upset up to that point in the competition’s history and one so shocking that some newspapers assumed the wire report of a 1-0 final score was a typo and so instead reported that England had won 10-0. That is a myth, apparently, but nobody could blame editors at the time for not believing the turn of events in Belo Horizonte. An England team featuring players such as Billy Wright, Tom Finney and Stan Mortensen were meant to wipe the floor with an American side made up largely of amateurs and who had arrived in Brazil having trained for only a week together. Even their own manager, Bill Jeffrey, described them as “‘sheep ready to be slaughtered” but in their second group game they performed like lions, taking the lead through a 38th-minute header from Joe Gaetjens, a Haitian-born dishwasher from New York, and holding on during a second-half onslaught from England to complete the so-called “Miracle on Grass”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/22/where-does-saudi-arabias-win-over-argentina-rank-in-world-cup-surprises">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is time for Messi and Argentina to save their World Cup campaign, however, despite a shock defeat by Saudi Arabia</p><p>There was more time. When you are Lionel Messi, there is always more time. Another split-second to play the pass. Another couple of beats to wait for the space to open up. Another year to mount a challenge. Another World Cup to fight. And here, on a bright warm day in November, with the clocks striking 13 minutes of injury time, there were still a few more seconds for Argentina to make things right.</p><p>Messi advanced down the right channel, nudging the ball along with impatient taps of his left outstep. A little space had opened up in front of him in the Saudi Arabia midfield. Ángel Di María was making the overlapping run on the right wing. In between him and the goal stood three defenders. Briefly, thrillingly, you could see the cogs whirring as Messi contemplated taking them all on and saving the match on his own. Instead, the pass went sideways to Di María and the cross went nowhere. There is always more time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/nov/22/lionel-messis-international-career-has-never-felt-closer-to-oblivion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dutchman overcame a slow start while Ferrari floundered but Lewis Hamilton still showed he can still race</p><p>After controversy over his first Formula One world championship in 2021, Max Verstappen left no question as to his deserved ascendancy this time. The Dutchman has been metronomic in his delivery, barely putting a foot wrong in claiming 15 wins from 22 races. Mechanical failures notwithstanding it could have been more. Moreover he did it with some panache. There were straightforward victories but also some supreme, authoritative demonstrations of man and machine in perfect harmony. Ferrari knew the game was up when Verstappen won three times from lowly grid slots, coming back from 10th in Hungary, 14th in Belgium and 7th in Italy. They were imperious and flawless drives that can only be admired. A shame then that his refusal to obey team orders at the season’s close cast something of a petulant pall over his success, not least in his unreasonable demands that the issue ceased to be discussed because the facts were not known but at the same time refusing to divulge said facts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/nov/22/verstappen-and-red-bull-unstoppable-in-year-of-george-russells-breakthrough">Continue reading...</a>

This could be the start of a classic 1950s war movie, but our expectations are soon turned upside down. The junior officer in the lead vehicle, Lieutenant David Stirling of the Scots guards, brings the convoy to a halt. They are on their way to relieve besieged Tobruk but, due to a miscalculation of staggering stupidity, he discovers that they have been given fuel for just 500 kilometres, not the 500 miles required. No more Colonel Bogey. Along with Stirling’s fury, the soundtrack explodes into AC/DC’s If You Want Blood (You’ve Got It).

<p>The former first daughter is no idiot. Why risk tainting her brand by associating with a loser?</p><p>Just a few years ago Ivanka Trump reportedly had her heart set on being the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/07/ivanka-trump-wants-to-be-the-first-female-us-president-perhaps-she-already-is-">US’s first female president</a>. Now, however, she seems desperate to stay as far away from politics as possible. The former first daughter has made it clear that while Daddy may be running for office again, she has no intention of joining him on the campaign trail. She has already selflessly served the public once, you see, and the public didn’t sufficiently appreciate her sacrifices. Now it’s time for a little self-care. “I love my father very much,” Ivanka <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/15/ivanka-trump-donald-trump-2024-campaign">said in a statement</a> following Donald Trump’s official 2024 announcement. “This time around, I am choosing to prioritise my children and the private life we are creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics.” To really hammer things home she was conspicuously absent when Trump, surrounded by family, made his official announcement from Mar-a-Lago last week. Even Ivanka’s husband, Jared Kushner, was in attendance.</p><p>Rumour has it that Trump isn’t happy his eldest daughter has decided to keep her distance. According to <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/11/17/ivanka-trump-hits-the-water-after-revealing-shes-done-with-politics/">the New York Post</a>, Trump spent much of Tiffany Trump’s recent wedding unsuccessfully trying to convince Ivanka, who has always been a big hit among his base, to join him for his campaign announcement – which I’m sure thrilled Tiffany, who has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/03/tiffany-trump-flying-like-a-bird-above-the-hurtful-rumours">always seemed like the most neglected child</a>.

It worked perfectly, with a game most nights to keep fanatics and TV executives happy. However, France 2025 intends to double the size of the women’s and wheelchair tournaments, which means an extra 16 games in each. That will require them all to start at the same time and be played over a month. Even if most men’s games remain at weekends, and matches are spread over a vastly larger geographic area, schedulers will find it extremely challenging to give the other tournaments the same airtime and media space that nourished them this time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/no-helmets-required/2022/nov/22/rugby-league-world-cup-finals-what-we-learned-manchester">Continue reading...</a>

That’s not to say you can’t save money on meat; it’s just more a case of what’s less spendy, as opposed to actually cheap. For example, Warren suggests “a nice bit of pork. Yes, it has probably seen the biggest rise, but it’s still a damned sight cheaper than beef.”</p><p>In terms of cuts, chef Henry Harris, whose new venture <a href="https://www.bouchonracine.com/">Bouchon Racine</a> opens at the Three Compasses in Farringdon, London, next week, suggests trying forequarter, or “the pieces towards the shoulder and up near the neck”.

<p>Belief is high that class of 2022 can build on third-place finish four years ago but doubts linger over Lukaku’s fitness</p><p>Golden generation. The eyes must roll every time that loaded description is mentioned in Belgium circles but there it is, from Eden Hazard no less, in a Fifa promotional video for the World Cup in which the Real Madrid man insists this incarnation has delivered on account of a third-place finish in Russia four years ago. Roberto Martínez concurs, although that is no great surprise from a master of positive spin who once described an Everton player’s broken leg as “a great opportunity” and every set of results going against Wigan in their fight for Premier League survival as good for his players’ mindset. They were relegated the next day courtesy of a 4-1 defeat at Arsenal.</p><p>Revisit Belgium’s performance in 2018, however, and it does seem churlish to dismiss Hazard’s and Martínez’s point entirely. Beating England for a second time in the tournament to win the third-place playoff meant something, as the jubilant reaction in the dugout and on the pitch demonstrated. It meant Belgium’s best placing at a World Cup, eclipsing the achievement of the Enzo Scifo, Jan Ceulemans, Eric Gerets and Jean-Marie Pfaff generation who finished fourth in Mexico in 1986. And it meant a great deal to the thousands of fans who packed the Grand-Place in Brussels, turning the air black, yellow and red with their flares as they gave the squad a triumphant homecoming. There was no sign of disappointment that day with a golden generation being unmasked as bronze.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/22/belgium-emerging-stars-world-cup-can-replenish-their-golden-stock">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A snappily directed debut from frequent Rian Johnson collaborator Noah Segan about a teenage girl looking for a father figure in a flighty vampire</p><p>From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/let-right-one-alfredson-horror">Let the Right One In</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/19/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-review-the-undead-prove-dead-funny">What We Do in the Shadows</a>, the domesticated wing of the vampire genre is getting overcrowded. So frequent Rian Johnson collaborator Noah Segan has done well to wangle himself a few inches of elbow room in his directorial debut with a surprisingly gentle, ruminative and haunted film concerned with family and belonging. Focused on an estranged father and daughter on the road played by Segan himself and Victoria Moroles, it almost plays out like an undead Paper Moon.</p><p>Blood Relatives starts with a Near Dark-like glower, as Segan’s biker-jacketed drifter Francis makes a convenience store stop-off for carb gaskets and haemoglobin. When he checks into a motel to escape daylight, he’s collared by obstinate teenager Jane (Moroles), whose mother has just died in Idaho. He scoffs when she claims he passed through their town 15 years ago, the same age as her. But he begins to warm up when she tells him that she must wear sunblock to go outside during the day, and is definitely paying attention by the time she bats the motel clerk, who thinks she is an underage sex worker, into a bloody mess against the wall. It’s Jane’s first kill.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/22/blood-relatives-review-smart-vampire-comedy-with-blood-and-bite">Continue reading...</a>

## Richard Dawson on his post-apocalyptic new album: ‘I would have to booby-trap a cave to survive’

<p>The Newcastle musician’s seventh album, The Ruby Cord, continues his commitment to world-building – here, a ravaged landscape inspired by gaming, slowness and ‘old-fashioned melody’</p><p>Richard Dawson doesn’t think he would survive for long in a post-apocalyptic world. Would he get killed off in the pre-credits sequence of a movie? “Probably, and it’s hard to admit that. I have sleep apnoea as well, so I’d have to go off on my own because I make such a noise when I sleep,” he says, over a pint by a crackling fire in The Boathouse pub in the Northumberland village of Wylam. It’s “probably the best pub in the world,” according to the sign outside, and today it feels like it. “I’ve actually given this a lot of thought. The only way I would survive would be to find a cave, and then to booby-trap it, because the volume of my snoring is immense. So not only am I going to have to sleep in a cave that is booby-trapped, I’m also going to be absolutely exhausted. I’m not going to last long.”</p><p>He laughs happily. “I already said to [partner and Hen Ogledd bandmate] Sally that when it happens, she’s better off doing me a favour and making it quick.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/22/richard-dawson-interview-the-ruby-cord">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What happened in Colorado Springs this weekend was part of a trend of escalating violence targeting gay spaces</p><p>As far as mass shootings, go, it was over quickly. Just before midnight on Saturday, a man carrying multiple magazines of ammunition entered the Club Q, a gay bar in Colorado Springs, Colorado, spraying gunfire. As bullets flew, two patrons at the club subdued the attacker by grabbing the gun from him, and hitting him with it. They held him down until police arrived. The first 911 call was made at 11.56pm; the killer was taken into custody at 12.02am. But in those six minutes, five people were killed, including Daniel Aston and Derrick Rump, two men who were tending bar, and Kerry Loving, a partygoer. Eighteen were wounded. As the clock struck midnight, it became a holiday for the bar’s community: Transgender Day of Remembrance, which honors trans people killed in hate attacks, was observed on Sunday.</p><p>There’s a grim routine, these days, to the mass shootings in America. Some elements remain constant from shooting to shooting. Usually, the gunman is a young white man, and usually, he has a history of violence against women. There will have been mental health episodes, or previous run-ins with police. But none of this history will have stopped him from getting a gun. American mass shooters tend to use automatic or semi-automatic long guns, the kind that aren’t available to civilians in other countries. Almost always, they purchased them legally.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/22/the-us-right-is-stoking-anti-lgbt-hate-this-shooting-was-no-surprise">Continue reading...</a>

Dynamically structured around personal testimonials, the film gives voice to the activists who dared to brave the clouds of teargas.</p><p>Mounted in response to a highly controversial plan from the Hong Kong government that would allow for extradition to mainland China, the demonstrations escalated in scale after police brutality against peaceful protesters. As well as covering the organising efforts of the mostly college-aged activists, the documentary also highlights how ordinary citizens rallied around the protests. Moments where older citizens offer to feed the young protesters or to drive them home are deeply moving and remind us that the majority of the activists have only just entered adulthood. The same phones on which they play video games are utilised to expose shocking scenes of violence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/22/hong-kong-city-on-fire-review-shocking-violence-in-chinas-city-of-dissent">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The only time I have felt loved and lusted after was when I had an affair – and I ended that for the sake of the kids</p><p><strong>I have been married for </strong><strong>more than 30 years, but my wife announced long ago that she didn’t want a sexual relationship and we haven’t made love for</strong><strong> the past 15 years. Even before, sex was infrequent. I believe my wife has a deep-rooted loathing of her body – I haven’t seen her anything less than fully clothed for all these 15 years; she showers behind closed doors and sleeps separately (because of my snoring). I had an affair 25 years ago and it was wonderful to feel loved and lusted after, but for the sake of the kids it stopped – I got on with my career and provided for my family. Now I am </strong><strong>in my 60s and desperate. I just want to feel loved and have a tactile relationship. I know this sounds pathetic but I feel damaged by all of this – because I am desperately lonely and angry. I get angry when my wife talks to people about our marriage as it’s such a sham. I don’t want to break up the family, but I don’t know what else to do.</strong></p><p>I am so sorry you’re feeling such pain, despair and longing. Many people in your situation simply compartmentalise their lives and have outside liaisons and relationships – and it would be understandable if that was something you were considering, despite the risks. Monogamy is not easy for anyone. If you think it would be possible to safely start a gentle conversation with your wife in which you could share your feelings in a non-blaming way, then try. You deserve to be heard – and so does she. Perhaps you will find a path to a mutual understanding of some kind (that could be more safely achieved with the help of a good counsellor). The resentment you harbour is affecting you as much as your loneliness and frustration – and it would be useful to have help to be able to let it go.

<p>Gross’s attractive intelligence and questing eye are to the fore in his 27th collection, a contender for the TS Eliot prize</p><p>Mastery is what you would wish for in a 27th collection and it is what you find in Philip Gross’s <em>The Thirteenth Angel</em>, shortlisted for the TS Eliot prize. And as we are counting, it seems worth adding that Gross is a poet who seeks to quantify the unquantifiable. In Psalm: You, he rushes straight in with the question: “who can number the waves on the sea” and, at different moments, marvels at the impossibility of keeping score – a reminder at once of the mystery of things and the scant control we have over our lives. His easy, fluent ways with form contrast with his conflicted subject matter. He has a questing eye and now, more than ever, writes to make sense of the world in its inexplicable multiplicity.</p><p>Springtime in Pandemia brings back 2020 – the beauty of the April weather and the alarm – and includes this lament: “If we could see each other/we could count.” In his opening poem, Nocturne: The Information, Gross turns night watchman to share a wakeful, meticulously unselective view of Finsbury Park, north London, with breeze-block offices, Caribbean takeaways and billboards while, at the same time, ambitiously invoking the invisible (uncountable?) digital landscape of which we are also a part. Midway, he arrestingly describes “our selves as shoal,/as murmuration”, which comes across as a souvenir from another world or from a different sort of poem.</p><p><em>The Thirteenth Angel</em> by Philip Gross is published by Bloodaxe (£12).

## The Fence review – rough justice on the meanish streets of 1980s Bristol

<p>Likable debut feature casts Sally Phillips as the mother of two tearaways, one of whom turns crimefighter when his motorbike is pinched</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>An expanded version of a well-received short of the same name made in 2018, this represents a sparky if a smidge predictable feature debut for writer-director William Stone, fronted by a mix of fresh and familiar onscreen faces. The redoubtable Sally Phillips (the Bridget Jones films, Veep) probably worked three or four days max to play put-upon working-class Sharon, mother to two variously dodgy young men, all of them living on a Bristol council estate in the 1980s. The younger brother Steve (David Perkins from Hollyoaks, a find) has a steady job working at the local butcher and boosts his income with illegal fishing, selling the catch to a local restaurant. As the film starts, he’s finally saved enough scratch to buy a small Honda XL 125 motorbike, which promptly gets nicked five minutes after he drives it home and leaves it parked by his front door.</p><p>This sets in train the rest of the plot which follows Steve as he trudges around town trying to find who stole his bike, especially since the police clearly have no interest in helping when they hear he is the kid brother of Andrew Knight (Eugene Simon, Game of Thrones). Andrew is on probation, and trying to go straight with a regular job, but a short temper and a killer right hook perpetually get him in trouble. Together the two brothers traverse the local underworld: a landscape full of pubs, municipal playgrounds, and quiet sidestreets where drug dealers do a lively trade in heroin.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/22/the-fence-review-1980s-bristol-sally-phillips">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sarah Boscarino plays a Gen Z-er girlbossing an exclusive country club, but  her charisma and comic timing can’t overcome the glaring implausibilities </p><p>From its faux female-empowerment storyline to its you-go-girl ethos, so much of Jeannette Godoy’s romantic comedy feels planted firmly in 2010s millennial culture. Given a membership by her millionaire uncle to his exclusive country club, our scrappy protagonist Ariana (Samantha Boscarino) spends the whole movie girlbossing her way to the top.

The positioning of Ariana as an underdog is quite ludicrous, considering how her family connections land her a personal interview with a media mogul. For a self-proclaimed Gen Z with a social justice conscience, it is bizarre that Ariana’s response to the hierarchical, old-fashioned exclusivity of the club is … to recruit hipper members. The film’s decision to frame her romance with Jason (Griffin Johnson), an employee at the club, as a badass act of defiance also rings hollow.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/22/diamond-in-the-rough-review-superficial-socially-conscious-update-of-the-mean-girl-romcom">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This intimate and immediate account of a 12-year-old girl under siege in Kharkiv includes photos and WhatsApp texts to heart-rending effect</p><p>“Until you’ve been there, you don’t know what war is.” This short, intense memoir of Yeva Skalietska is the record, told in diary form, of the transformation of the life of a 12-year-old Ukrainian girl from Kharkiv. Yeva writes in direct, unadorned prose – she enjoyed learning English at school and the poise and precision of her language are extraordinary, given her age and the fact that she has constructed this record in words she has only ever encountered in the classroom or on television.</p><p>Yeva lives with her grandmother, Iryna, in an apartment on the outskirts of Kharkiv. From her window, she can see “huge empty fields that lead on to the Russian border”. We get a brief snapshot of her prewar life: parties, painting, tenpin bowling. It’s a vision of normality that is shattered by the events of 24 February 2022.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/22/you-dont-know-what-war-is-by-yeva-skalietska-review-ukrainian-child-poignant-diary">Continue reading...</a>

He monitored various things: the number of people who came and left; what customers and staff were doing. It was guesswork, really, making up his mind when to hit it. Dyer had never robbed a bank before.</p><p>It was mid-morning, in August 1999. A few hours earlier, still dark outside, Dyer had grabbed his “war bag”, complete with gun, gloves, matches, a lighter and a metal bar, and driven north through Los Angeles from his home in Mission Viejo. He’d taken Interstate 405 and joined Route 101. During an impromptu bathroom stop, he’d settled on this target at random. He’d already tried to rob the place once, an hour or so earlier. That first attempt was abandoned before it even started. “I’d walked towards the door, but noticed a pregnant lady entering at the same time,” Dyer says now, 23 years later. “I couldn’t risk scaring her into an early labour. When I turned back around, I noticed my reflection. Yes, I was wearing a baseball cap and glasses, but I was still very identifiable. I realised how close I’d been to making a massive error.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/22/robbed-six-banks-out-of-desperation-kangaroo-bandit-cain-vincent-dyer">Continue reading...</a>

The luck is running for Head. Woakes nails him in line with the stumps, and Pistol Reiffel pulls the trigger, but Head was up on his toes and has cause for concern about the height. As it turns out, the review shows it pitching a millimetre outside leg stump, so the ball-tracking doesn’t even come into it. Warner demonstrates to him how to play a leave after that, then all but chips a catch to mid off, landing just wide and short. Which is also a description of the batsman. </p><p><strong>2nd over: Australia 12-0 (Head 9, Warner 1) </strong>Head: dropped! And England drop heads.
