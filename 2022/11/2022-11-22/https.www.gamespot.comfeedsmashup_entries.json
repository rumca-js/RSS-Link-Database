"2022-11-22 20:59:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Although Call of Duty: Warzone 2 introduces the new Al Mazrah map, it integrates both new and iconic locations together to serve as a crucible for the battle royale's big overhaul to a lot of core features and the introduction of Modern Warfare 2's mechanics and movement. The end result is mixed, with some of Warzone 2.0's new additions making the moment-to-moment action feel fresh, while updates to other classic Warzone features feel like a step back for the battle royale title.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Warzone 2's 150-player skirmishes of solo, duo, trio, and quad combatants are played out on the new Al Mazrah map. The fictional desert region in Western Asia does a great job of combining new Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer maps with several nostalgic locations that longtime Call of Duty fans will recognize. Your adventures in Al Mazrah will take you through Rust, Terminal, Highrise, Afghan, and Quarry from the original Modern Warfare 2, and every location--old or new--blends together to create a vibrant and beautiful environment.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In comparison to Modern Warfare's Verdansk map, Al Mazrah feels more diverse, with its mixture of arid desert, large bodies of water, tight cities, and exposed small towns. Water was very limited in the original Warzone because Modern Warfare lacked swimming mechanics, but the sequel brings over all the features and mechanics of Modern Warfare 2, which means that large bodies of water, boats and swimming are now added to the mix, and they're meaningful additions that give you fresh ways to take on fights in Warzone 2. Being able to dive away from a bad gunfight or use it for stealth to flank an opponent in particular adds a new kind of dynamism to engagements.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-warzone-2-review-al-mazrah-shines/1900-6418003/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamestop-black-friday-sale-best-deals/2900-4464/", "title": "GameStop Black Friday Sale Best Deals", "date_published": "2022-11-22 20:59:00+00:00", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4066816-horizonforbiddenwest%2810%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Black Friday is in full swing at GameStop, with tons of PS5, Switch, and Xbox games reaching some of the lowest prices of 2022.

The hardest part, however, is actually finding Dunsparce in Paldea. They\u2019re technically common across most of the region, but a quirk in their nature means getting close enough to capture one takes some extra work.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">How to get Dunsparce in Scarlet and Violet</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Dunsparce have a low chance of appearing across more than half of Paldea\u2019s map, including:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\">South Province Areas One, Three, Four, Five, and Six</li><li dir=\"ltr\">East Province Areas One, Two, and Three</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Alfornada Cavern</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Asado Desert</li><li dir=\"ltr\">West Province Areas Two and Three</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike in Dunsparce\u2019s early days, this Normal-type Pokemon doesn\u2019t only live in caves.

need not fear being taken down because of how they are playing the game.</p><p>However, there are limitations on what these servers will be allowed to do and how they can act, similar to the company's

This is especially problematic if you're just one card short of a powerhouse deck, and Second Dinner has <a href=\"https://www.marvelsnap.com/newsdetail?id=7168728561379973894\">announced plans to address that</a> in the next game patch.</p><p>Currently, you acquire cards by upgrading your Collection Rank. Once you get past Collection rank 500, though, acquiring cards becomes more inconsistent, since they come in Collector's Caches that can also consist of other items like boosters or credits. Plus there's so many cards in that pool that when cards do unlock, it probably won't be the one you need. With the next update, Marvel Snap will add \"Collector's Tokens,\" a new currency that you'll acquire in Collector's Caches instead of boosters.</p><p>Collector's Tokens can be used to purchase cards outright from the Token Shop. The shop selection will rotate every eight hours, and if you see a card you want to buy you can pin it to keep its place in the shop while you save up the tokens you need to buy it. The frequent card rotation means that you should see any card you're missing as long as you check in regularly.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-will-finally-let-you-acquire-specific-cards-you-want/1100-6509413/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todays-wordle-answer-522-november-23-2022/1100-6509409/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Today's Wordle Answer (#522) - November 23, 2022", "date_published": "2022-11-22 19:05:00+00:00", "description": "<p>It might be the middle of the week, but there's still no slowing down this <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/wordle/\">Wordle </a>train.

In a recent interview with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmZvFuPHYo\">Kinda Funny</a>, Williams said that he wants to make a Castlevania game, and he told fans to lobby Konami <a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/god-of-war-ragnaroks-director-says-he-wants-to-work-on-castlevania-next/\">to license the IP</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"I don't know what I'm doing next, but if somebody gives me that Castlevania license, we'd love to make that,\" Williams said. Though it seems that Williams was joking to some extent, his enthusiasm for the Castlevania series is clear in the interview. At one point, he says that he's going to \"get in so much trouble\" for these comments. However, he further states that he wants to use Kinda Funny's platform to get the word out.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The last mainline Castlevania game, Lords of Shadow 2, came out in 2014. Though it might seem like a long-shot, Konami has shown a recent willingness to create new games rather than license its IPs for gambling.

Check out everything coming to Netflix in November below, plus some of our recommendations.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Easily, one of the biggest attractions coming to Netflix in December is Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery. Coming to the streaming service on December 23, the sequel has been faring well on Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes--as of this writing, it's got an aggregate score of <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/movie/glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery\">82</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/glass_onion_a_knives_out_mystery\">93</a>, respectively, from the handful of critics <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery-round-up-what-critics-are-saying/1100-6507442/\">who have seen it so far</a>. (It'll also be in theaters for one week only, starting November 23.) The film's ensemble includes a returning Daniel Craig as master detective Benoit Blanc, joined by newcomers Edward Norton, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Kathryn Hahn, Leslie Odom Jr., Jessica Henwick, Madelyn Cline, Kate Hudson, and Dave Bautista. It looks truly nutty and like a great time--Norton plays a colorful tech billionaire named Miles Bron. Bron invites his friends for a getaway on his private Greek island--but when someone turns up dead, Craig's Detective Benoit Blanc is put on the case.</p><div>          </div><p dir=\"ltr\">On December 25, The Witcher: Blood Origin comes to Netflix. The prequel series was <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-witcher-blood-origin-trailer-arrives/1100-6499120/\">first teased in December 2021</a>.

The DualSense controllers don't have the best battery life, so this will definitely save you some headaches. </p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-the-official-ps5-dualsense-charger-before-black-friday/1100-6509390/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-2-is-the-worst-business-case-in-movie-history-james-cameron-says/1100-6509388/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Avatar 2 Is The \"Worst Business Case In Movie History,\" James Cameron Says", "date_published": "2022-11-22 14:25:00+00:00", "description": "<p>James Cameron himself has described Avatar: The Way of Water as a very bad business decision for a film studio, but it's being made all the same.

Today, Epic revealed the first visual tease of the event since its name was revealed during the FNCS. Along with that teaser image come a few other remarks from the developer-publisher, including exactly when you can play, how many friends can join you in your party, and the introduction of a new party-up ability that will ensure no one has to fend off the fracture alone. Here's everything you need to know about the Fortnite Fracture event.</p><h2>Fortnite event start time</h2><p>The Fortnite Chapter 3 finale, Fracture, will be a one-time-only event that begins on <strong>December 3 at 1 PM PT / 4 PM ET</strong>. As usual, the playlist to get into the event will open up 30 minutes beforehand, and it's recommended you get there early to reserve your spot. I've not heard of anyone being denied entry to similar Fortnite events due to server overload, and Epic seems hellbent on ensuring it can always house every single player who tries to attend, but just in case, getting there early is a good idea.</p><p>Typically these events last for about 12-15 minutes and unfold almost like live theater that each player experiences firsthand as a direct participant in the plot. Curiously, Epic noted that players who arrive late can join the event in progress until as late as 40 minutes after it begins, implying this event may go on much longer, or perhaps some element of the event will stay accessible for a while after until servers eventually go offline.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-fracture-chapter-3-finale-event-start-time-revealed-alongside-new-multiplayer-feature/1100-6509376/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-operation-solar-raid-release-date-trailer-and-new-info-revealed/1100-6509386/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Rainbow Six Siege Operation Solar Raid Release Date, Trailer, And New Info Revealed", "date_published": "2022-11-22 13:32:00+00:00", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/\">Rainbow Six Siege</a> continues to grow, with Ubisoft confirming that the final season of Year 7, Operation Solar Raid, will launch on December 6--and it's yet another big-time update.</p><p>Described as Siege's biggest season yet, Operation Solar Raid adds fan-requested features like cross-play and cross-progression, as well as a new battle pass, a new map, a new Operator, and a new Ranked 2.0 playlist, among other things.
