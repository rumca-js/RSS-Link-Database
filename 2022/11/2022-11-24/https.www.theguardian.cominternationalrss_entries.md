<p>Yes, Brazil: that’s pretty much how we remembered you. This is a new generation of Brazilian players, a new era and a new World Cup challenge. And yet by the same token this was a classic Brazilian tournament performance: the sort that feels like it’s being put on for our benefit. On a still night in the giant golden ark of the Lusail Stadium, the tournament favourites played the game you expect from tournament favourites: solid, expansive, and embellished with the sort of effortless brilliance that makes other countries furrow their brow a little.</p><p>The match had three distinct periods. In period one Brazil started pretty tamely, perhaps even uncertainly, picking away at Serbia with tempo but not a great deal of poise. As the second half progressed they began to warm to the task, cathartically breaking the deadlock with a goal from Richarlison. In the final half hour they simply cut loose: riotous skills, relentless waves of attack and an early goal of the tournament contender from Richarlison, who scored his second with an outrageous bicycle kick.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/24/brazil-serbia-world-cup-group-g-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p></p><p>A stodgy contest morphed into a thriller and, cutting through it all, Cristiano Ronaldo managed to own the story. At times it felt most of the stadium was willing him to score and they were ecstatic to see their wish granted when he converted a penalty midway through the second half, becoming the first player to score at five different World Cups. Against most expectations it opened the floodgates, André Ayew equalising for a decent Ghana side before João Félix and Rafael Leão responded quickly with clinical finishes. Osman Bukari’s late goal was not enough to capture the headlines for Ghana.</p><p>Record-breaker or not, the chances of Ronaldo facilitating a narrative that did not concern him were always going to be vanishingly small. Before kick-off he had stood directly in front of the throng of photographers present to aid analysis of his every spit and cough; he must surely have known what he was doing as he faced in the opposite direction, that number seven in full view of the lenses, while taking a drink.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/24/portugal-ghana-world-cup-group-h-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Over the past two decades she has emerged as one of the leading figures of European music of our time. But perhaps because the London-born Saunders lives in Berlin, she still receives far too few performances in Britain. There has been just one of her works, for instance, in the main series of the BBC Proms, and that was in 2009 – though her music has been regularly programmed at the Huddersfield Contemporary Music festival.</p><p>This superb disc ought to gain Saunders many more admirers, for it includes one of her finest achievements: Skin for soprano and ensemble, which was composed in 2016 for Juliet Fraser, who is the outstanding singer here with Klangforum Wien. The text is Saunders’ own, incorporating an extract from Molly Bloom’s final monologue in Ulysses. (James Joyce, along with Samuel Beckett, has been a regular ingredient in Saunders’ music.) Identifiable words and phrases emerge only fitfully, yet acquire even more expressive power through their infrequency alongside passages in which voice and instruments create webs of brilliantly sculpted textures, sometimes intensely fragile, sometimes furiously wrought.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/24/rebecca-saunders-skin-void-unbreathed-review-juliet-fraser">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Decades after the world’s biggest otter disappeared from the country, a kayaking trip revealed a lone male swimming in the Bermejo River</p><p>“This really is a big animal,” says Sebastián Di Martino, conservation director of Rewilding Argentina, emphasising the “giant” in giant otter (<em>Pteronura brasiliensis</em>). “It can be 1.7 metres long … the biggest otter in the world.”</p><p>Until its recent rediscovery, the giant otter was feared extinct in the country as a result of habitat loss and hunting. “Family groups were last seen in the 1980s in the Misiones province of north-eastern Argentina,” Di Martino says. “In the Bermejo River, the last sightings occurred 130 years ago, in 1898.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/24/lost-and-found-argentina-delights-in-giant-otters-return-aoe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The judgment says one thing constitutionally – but it’s a backhanded recognition of the power of popular resistance</p><p>At the heart of the debate over independence is a deceptively complex question: who decides? It sounds easy enough, and supporters of independence think the answer is clear: Scotland decides. For the most diehard opponents of independence, there is also a simple response: the UK decides. For those who settle somewhere between these two positions, however, things get more complex. What exactly are Scotland or the UK deciding on, and how?</p><p>In its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/23/scottish-independence-supreme-court-scottish-parliament-second-referendum-indyref2">judgment on Wednesday</a>, the supreme court attempted to bring a little clarity to the debate after months of deliberations and thousands of pages of argument and evidence. The question was not independence itself, but whether the Scottish government has the power to hold a purely “advisory” referendum on independence. The ruling was instigated by the Scottish government’s own lord advocate, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/05/independence-vote-may-be-unlawful-says-scotlands-lord-advocate">referred the issue to the court</a> in pursuit of a legally watertight means of fulfilling the manifesto promises on which the Scottish parliament’s SNP-Green majority was elected.</p><p>Rory Scothorne is a historian and writer based in Edinburgh<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/24/supreme-court-scottish-nationalists-judgment">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new documentary extends 200 seconds of home-movie footage shot in Poland in 1938 into a forensic examination of a community obliterated by the Nazis</p><p>Like anyone else, every now and again I come across old photos of family holidays. There are quite a few from the mid-1970s, mostly taken on Bournemouth beach. Obviously, I look at the faces of my parents, now gone, or of me and my sisters – but sometimes I find myself focusing on the other holidaymakers in the background, in their own deckchairs or building their own sandcastles: strangers who, by chance, were caught by our camera and preserved for ever.</p><p>There is something of that sensation – the random serendipity of the tourist’s lens – at work in a mesmerising new film called <a href="https://superltd.com/films/three-minutes-a-lengthening">Three Minutes: A Lengthening</a>. It runs for just over an hour, and yet all the images you see come from the same three (or nearly four) minutes of amateur, home-movie footage – those 200-odd seconds of cine film played in full once at the beginning and once again at the end. In between, sequences are played backwards or forwards, sometimes slowed down, sometimes freeze-framed. We zoom out and zoom in. Some frames are magnified to such an extent that what we see is a kind of microscopic blur. The original three-minute film was shot with barely a thought, by an American man on vacation in Europe decades ago, but this new documentary invites us to stare with rare intensity at the people who happened to find themselves in front of his lens.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/24/a-small-victory-against-erasure-the-three-minutes-that-bring-an-exterminated-jewish-past-to-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The legend behind songs like D.I.S.C.O. – and the father of half of Daft Punk – ruled the 70s then scorned the music industry for decades. With the reissue of his own wildly eclectic oeuvre, he is re-emerging – briefly</p><p>Almost the first thing Daniel Vangarde says when he walks into the Paris office of his record label is that he’s never done an interview in English before. Then again, he adds, he had never done an interview in his native French either until this morning. He never bothered talking to journalists at the height of his career, when he was a key figure in French pop: an artist, writer and producer behind an array of releases that range from the wildly obscure to the instantly familiar. And he certainly wasn’t expecting to start meeting the press aged 75: Vangarde had retired years ago, relocating to a remote fishing village in northern Brazil.</p><p>But then a record company unexpectedly approached him about a career-spanning compilation, named after Zagora, the label he founded in 1974, which piqued his interest. When they sent him the track listing, he told them that some of the songs on it weren’t his. They were – he’d just forgotten them entirely.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/24/disco-maestro-daniel-vangarde-thomas-bangalter-daft-punk">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘They teach us’: how whales can help dispel the myth of green capitalism

<p>In her new book, Adrienne Buller argues the desire to eke profit out of climate policy is wilfully naive</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, a group of my students told me they thought capitalism would fix the climate crisis. It was the end of term and we had spent weeks debating world politics; they were not uncritical or naive. But as fires ripped through homes and flood water lapped at people’s stairs, with extreme weather driven by the climate crisis hitting countries around the world, they looked at the global scale of the economic and political forces driving capitalism and asked if that may be our best chance. If the system would have no other option but to course correct when faced with planetary collapse. Adrienne Buller’s recent book, The Value of a Whale<em>,</em> dashes whatever hopes they might have had. Green capitalism will not save us, she argues – if anything, it is making the climate crisis worse.</p><p>Green capitalism may not be what you think it is. With much discussion about the danger of climate denial and the criticism of oil and gas companies’ climate-conscious ads, Buller’s book points to a shift that we risk missing. In the past decade, some capitalists have embraced green politics and not just for the sake of optics. Seeing the climate crisis as an unprecedented threat to capitalism, they don’t want to disprove its existence but solve it. As an example, read the annual letter from the <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter">BlackRock CEO, Larry Fink</a>. Their approaches – “prices, markets and clever financial products”, Buller writes – are now “guiding much of the global response to the ecological crisis”. In Buller’s reading, then, my students’ optimism was at least partially founded: capitalists have woken up to the problem. But what to make of their solutions?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/24/how-whales-can-help-dispel-the-myth-of-green-capitalism-adrienne-buller">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Parlophone) <br /></strong>A four-disc compilation of demos and rarities offers a refreshing riposte to today’s ‘Bowie is perfect’ industry, with ill-advised covers and middle-of-the-road pop co-mingling with the decade-defining genius of his 1971 masterpiece<br /></p><p>We tend to think of 1971’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/07/moment-that-changed-me-david-bowie-hunky-dory">Hunky Dory</a> as the moment David Bowie finally snapped into focus after years of dead ends and false starts. It opens with a song often seen as his mission statement, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BgF7Y3q-as">Changes</a>, with its promise of constant forward motion and undertaking to make pop weird again. It unveiled the brand of glam rock that would send his career stratospheric, on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuDJue0r2G8">Queen Bitch</a>, and his most celebrated backing band, soon to be renamed the Spiders From Mars. It features a succession of his most indelible songs – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZKcl4-tcuo">Life on Mars?</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBgU0tiLy2s">Oh! You Pretty Things</a> – and, in its lyrics, the preoccupations that would fuel his career through the 1970s: sexuality and gender, imminent apocalypse, artifice and role-playing, the peculiar and disturbing ideas about mysticism and the occult that would reappear on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie">Station to Station</a>. Here, at last, was the David Bowie who knew exactly what he was doing, who was no longer pretending to be a hippy, or a proponent of “heavy” music, or an Anthony Newley-ish all-round entertainer; the Bowie who would so confidently cut through the coming decade that pop music and youth culture were both changed in his wake.</p><p>The truth, as revealed by Divine Symmetry – a beautifully packaged 4CD box set subtitled An Alternative Journey Through Hunky Dory – appears to have been substantially less straightforward than that. The first CD of demos presents us with an artist still firing out songs in all directions, including the middle of the road. One minute he’s channelling the Velvet Underground or daringly capturing the cruisey atmosphere of London’s gay scene on Looking for a Friend, the next he’s knocking out an oompah song intended for Tom Jones (How Lucky You Are). Songs of the depth and mystery of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFN_bEgDE0M">Quicksand</a> rub shoulders with stuff that harks back to his eponymous 1967 debut album – the protagonist of the jaunty Right On Mother, delighted that his mum likes his fiancee, would fit right in with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_Zl1TVA9Kk">Uncle Arthur</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeXLS5jTdA">Little Bombadier</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/24/david-bowie-divine-symmetry-review-hunky-dory-box-set">Continue reading...</a>

Unusually, he combined the early part of his career with university study, reading maths, physics, chemistry and statistics at Glasgow – though it was never clear whether it was this or his accent that caused Bryan Robson to observe that “he’s meant to be funny but none of us can understand him”. McClair is also owner of Choccy, one of football’s classic nicknames – “as his last name rhymed with the delicacy ‘chocolate éclair’,” advises Wikipedia – and earned the admiration of the great Lord Ferg for his devotion to training in shorts regardless of the weather. He was also lauded for his devastating finishing in and around the goalline. Had the Puskás Award existed in 1991-92, he would surely have won it for the beauty that <a href="https:///[https//twitter.com/swfc/status/1452936495447384065">can be seen at 1m20s here</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/24/football-daily-email-fifa-time-keeping-human-rights-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Admirably straightforward drama follows two of the reporters who cut through the defences around the apparently invulnerable producer</p><p>The title takes the second half of the famous phrase habitually used to dismiss rape allegations as hearsay – “he said, she said” – and in doing so restores the importance of women’s testimony. This is the story of the two New York Times reporters, Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, and their battle to write the story about the now disgraced and imprisoned movie producer Harvey Weinstein and his decades-long practice of intimidation, harassment and rape of young female actors and junior staff, hushing them up with threats and NDA payoffs, enabled by a vast male superstructure of silence. It is adapted by Rebecca Lenkiewicz from the journalists’ book of the same title and directed by Maria Schrader.</p><p>The journalists’ plan was to try for a number of accusers going public at once – or failing that, to get one prominent survivor on the record and count on others coming forward; this was the foundation of the #MeToo strategy. Carey Mulligan plays Twohey and Zoe Kazan plays Kantor, and theirs is a very 21st-century workplace: as well as their stressful work, Twohey and Kantor have to deal with motherhood, babies and exhaustion, which never worried Woodward and Bernstein. But as life is messy and complicated, someone else is working on the same story: Ronan Farrow for the New Yorker, whose work is mentioned rather cursorily in this movie.

<p><strong>Town Hall, Huddersfield</strong><br />The mercurial composer’s brilliant score perfectly captures the raging agony and beatific ecstasy of Carl Theodor Dreyer’s silent movie masterpiece</p><p>J<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/julia-holter">ulia Holter</a>’s mercurial career has taken her from traditional pop to chamber music, indie to electronica, the avant grade underground to the Top 20 and recently to film scores. Here, the Los Angeles-based composer has teamed up with the 36-strong Chorus of Opera North for the world premiere of her new live score for Carl Theodor Dreyer’s 1928 silent movie masterpiece, The Passion of Joan of Arc. Holter initially performed a live soundtrack to the film in LA in 2017. This Huddersfield Contemporary Music festival performance was delayed for two years by the pandemic, but Holter kept writing, completing most of this finished score this year.</p><p>The newly restored subtitled black and white film – telling the story of the French saint’s religious persecution and execution with a script derived from minutes of her 1431 trial – is shown above the stage. Holter, behind a keyboard, sits with the chorus and musicians. A sense that anything could happen is reinforced by the provision of earplugs, and signs reading “This performance will be loud”. It begins with a hush, as a mournful trumpet is gently augmented by a percussionist to create a funeral, death-march effect.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/24/julia-holter-the-passion-of-joan-of-arc-review-town-hall-huddersfield">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With films such as 1960’s Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, Karel Reisz was a pioneer in reshaping perceptions of ordinary Britons. I think there’s still lots to learn from them</p><p>Twenty years ago on Friday my father, the film-maker Karel Reisz, died at the age of 76. Along with Lindsay Anderson and Tony Richardson, he was a leading figure of the British new wave. Unlike Anderson, who cultivated an outspokenly cantankerous persona, he disliked being interviewed about his work and was never really a public figure. Yet, rather like Ken Loach today, his films were widely admired for compassionately exploring the parts of British society that most earlier directors had ignored. At a time of economic turmoil and intense disillusion with politics, they remain urgently relevant.</p><p>Born into a middle-class Jewish family in Czechoslovakia, my father escaped to Britain on a kindertransport at the age of 12 (both my paternal grandparents were murdered in Auschwitz). Though he rapidly assimilated into British life at a Quaker boarding school, then Cambridge and the RAF, he always retained the ability to examine this country with a sharp outsider’s eye. Over and above their technical skill, his films remain resonant for their joyful and curious engagement with people from backgrounds utterly unlike his own. I reserve a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/23/child-refugee-karel-reisz-films">special contempt</a> for those such as Dominic Raab, Priti Patel and now Suella Braverman who are themselves of immigrant stock but seem to take pleasure in excluding (and often demonising) others.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/24/karel-reisz-saturday-night-sunday-morning">Continue reading...</a>

The novel is happier in a secular space.” He is writing about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/26/marilynne-robinson-author-gilead-interview-barack-obama-jack-america" title="">Marilynne Robinson</a>, a writer skilled, as he says, at “making religious thought easy” – easy for the reader, however unbelieving, to accept. It is a skill he admires. Yet his own novels hardly inhabit a “secular space”. Catholicism is a live presence in all the ones set in Ireland, while his interest in Christian myth even led him, in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/19/inspiration-testament-mary-colm-toibin" title="">The Testament of Mary</a>, to create the first-person narrative of Jesus’s mother as she nears death.</p><p>These essays, published over the course of more than 25 years, confirm his interest in religion and religiosity. “Religiosity” because he restlessly documents the hypocrisies and misdeeds of the Roman Catholic clergy. Yet he does so with the mingled perplexity and outrage of one who is steeped in Catholicism. “I was born in Ireland and brought up a Catholic.” Almost every one of these essays is shaped by one of these two facts, sometimes by both.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/24/a-guest-at-the-feast-by-colm-toibin-review-a-writers-roots">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Before a miraculous recovery from cancer made him more famous than ever, the Dr Feelgood guitarist fired up 70s rock with proto-punk playing and divisive songwriting<br />• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/23/wilko-johnson-dies-aged-75">Wilko Johnson dies aged 75</a><br />• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/23/wilko-johnson-obituary">Obituary: Wilko Johnson</a></p><p>When the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/10/wilko-johnson-interview-ive-got-a-future">interviewed Wilko Johnson in 2015</a>, he expressed concern that he might now be viewed “as the Cancer Bloke rather than a guitar player”. You could understand his unease. The astonishing story of Johnson’s diagnosis with terminal pancreatic cancer in 2013, followed by his seemingly miraculous recovery after a doctor who happened to be in the audience at one of his farewell shows suggested he visit an oncologist for a second opinion, had made him more famous than he had ever been: a “100-1 shot for the title of Greatest Living Englishman”, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/04/oil-city-confidential-review">one critic put it</a>, who had first wowed the general public with the calm, philosophical acceptance of imminent death he displayed in interviews after his diagnosis, then cheated death entirely.</p><p>But, really, there was no danger of anything overshadowing Johnson’s importance as a guitarist. When other musicians attested to the life-changing impact of seeing Dr Feelgood live in 1974 or 75 – and everyone from Paul Weller and Joe Strummer to Suggs from Madness and Bill Drummond of the KLF did – it was always Johnson they singled out. Their late frontman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/dec/01/cult-heroes-lee-brilleaux-dr-feelgood">Lee Brilleaux</a> was a brilliant vocalist and performer, but Wilko Johnson was Dr Feelgood’s visual focus. The oft-repeated line is that, with their cheap suits and air of menace, Dr Feelgood looked less like rock stars than villains from The Sweeney. More accurately, they looked like three villains from The Sweeney who had been forced to keep an eye on their boss’s unpredictable nephew: Johnson, who careered around the stage, mouth permanently open, eyes bulging with the effect of amphetamines beneath his pudding-basin haircut, raising his guitar to his shoulder as if it were a gun, occasionally colliding with his bandmates as they affected to ignore him and glowered at the audience.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/24/wilko-johnson-dr-feelgood-tribute-cancer-70s-rock">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The UK was once dotted with structures designed to survive nuclear conflict, from sprawling government complexes to tiny underground observation posts. How many are still in use – and what are your chances of getting a place if you need one?</p><p>Michael Parrish has a “wedding guest list” of people he will allow into his three-level, 125ft (38 metre)-deep concrete bunker in the event of a nuclear attack. Situated below an inconspicuous bungalow in Brentwood, Essex, the Kelvedon Hatch bunker was built on Parrish’s grandfather’s land in the 1950s and maintained as secret regional government headquarters throughout the cold war. After it was decommissioned in 1992, the Parrishes bought back the bunker – for more than 20 years, it has been a tourist attraction and a sleepover location for Boy Scouts. Today, it is also potentially a lifeline.</p><p>“We have our own water, we have our own electricity, we have our own toilets, because one day I may need it,” says Parrish, 75, wearing a burgundy jumper with the words “secret nuclear bunker” embroidered in yellow on the left breast. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, 15 people have inquired about hiring a space in the bunker in the event of nuclear war, but Parrish wants to charge £500,000 a head (a bargain, he says, if you spend 10 to 20 years down there avoiding nuclear fallout).

<p>Don Shula’s team won every single game on their way to victory in Super Bowl VII. They are still the only NFL team to have recorded a perfect season</p><p>It’s been 50 years since the 1972 Miami Dolphins became the first (and, so far, only) team in NFL history to win every game in a season. For many who played on the Dolphins that year, it’s hard to reconcile the passage of time with the immediacy of the memories. “Fifty years is a long time ago,” laughs Dick Anderson, the Dolphins’ Pro Bowl safety in 1972, but it “feels like it was yesterday.”</p><p>It’s useful to quickly clarify one aspect of the ’72 Dolphins’ achievement – for a finicky reason, the phrase “perfect season” (rather than “undefeated season”) is often used to describe the campaign. Although ties are uncommon in today’s game, they were once relatively prevalent. In the 1920s, four teams technically finished their seasons ‘undefeated,’ although each of them finished with at least one draw. As such, the Dolphins’ lossless <em>and tieless</em> 1972 season remains unique in NFL history. The league itself has acknowledged the team’s peerless performance – the ’72 Dolphins were judged to be the greatest team in NFL history during the league’s centennial celebrations in 2019.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/24/miami-dolphins-1972-unbeaten-season-nfl-football-don-shula">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Emma Corrin and Jack O’Connell carry this idealistic, moving French version of DH Lawrence’s transgressive novel</p><p>Here is a movie that could so easily collapse into self-satire, especially at the first sneery-knowing intonation of the word “milady”, a phrase probably now most associated with Parker from Thunderbirds. But the commitment and passion of its two lead performers, Emma Corrin and Jack O’Connell, carries this new version of DH Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover, and the actor turned director Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre finds the keynote of idealism. The film is never shy of eroticism and full-on sex, if sometimes going for a slightly quaint soft-focus approach. But Clermont-Tonnerre is never in any doubt that this is a love story. The last adaptation of any note was from another French film-maker, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/24/worldcinema.romance">Pascale Ferran’s flawed Lady Chatterley</a> (based on an earlier version of the book). Perhaps it takes a French and not a British director to respond to Lawrence’s forbidden tale of forbidden love.<br /><br />It is the middle of the first world war and Constance Reid (Corrin) is the beautiful and impulsive young woman of upper-class birth and progressive views who, after a chequered emotional past, honestly believes herself to be in love with Sir Clifford Chatterley; they get married before he has to return to the front, hardly knowing each other at all. At the war’s end, he is a gloomier figure, using a wheelchair after a terrible war injury, and it is in a sombre mood that the new Lady Chatterley is to arrive with him at Wragby, his vast country estate, paid for by the sweated labour at his colliery.</p><p>There, she is alienated from the friends he invites up from London for the weekend. Sir Clifford is a shallow, meretricious figure: after dabbling in writing fiction, he throws himself into making his colliery even more profitable by laying off some miners and exploiting the rest more ruthlessly.<strong> </strong>This impotent plutocrat is coldly obsessed with producing an heir, making it clear to the bewildered Constance that he will permit her to have a discreet affair if that produces the correct result. As it happens, Constance has become obsessed with the handsome gamekeeper, Mellors (vehemently played by O’Connell, who maintains his character’s dignity).

<p>Childhood soulmates reunite in later life in this passionate novel from The Eighth Life author</p><p>No one was more attuned to the paradoxes of love than Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke. “Togetherness between two people is an impossibility,” he wrote in<em> </em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/12/letters-rainer-maria-rilke-review" title="">Letters to a Young Poet</a>. “But, once the realisation is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue to exist, a wonderful living side by side can grow up, if they succeed in loving the distance between them.”</p><p>This paradox – of the twinned closeness and alienation in lovers – is at the heart of Nino Haratischvili’s My Soul Twin<em>,</em> her second novel to be translated into English after the huge success of her award-winning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/04/the-eighth-life-for-brilka-by-nino-haratischivili-review" title="">The Eighth Life</a>, a 900-page saga that chronicled Georgia’s plight under Soviet occupation and subsequent struggle for independence. Haratischvili writes in German but was born in Tbilisi, Georgia. Longlisted for the International Booker prize, and nicknamed the “Georgian War and Peace”, The Eighth Life was praised for its elegance as much as its heft; Haratischvili brilliantly combined social commentary with finely drawn characterisation to tell a story of Georgia’s Soviet past that had been largely unexamined. Georgians – many still divided over their Soviet legacy – loved it, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/24/my-soul-twin-by-nino-haratischvili-review-the-curse-of-the-past">Continue reading...</a>

Manager Tite included 12 players from the Premier League in his 26-man squad – second only to England – and 22 in total from European clubs. Brazilian players have increasingly made home in Europe but their style is not always feted. At least once a month this season a young, skilful Brazilian has been criticised for doing what they do best: entertaining fans, expressing themselves and exhibiting their art.</p><p>Most recently, it was Antony’s turn to suffer a media pile-on in his adopted home.

The Dutchman convinced the club to pay Ajax £82m – an Eredivisie record – for the 22-year-old. The forward has enjoyed a strong start in England, setting a record as the first United player to score in his first three Premier League games. He was generally well received by fans and the media. Until he did the unthinkable and tried to pull off a trick during a 3-0 win over Sheriff in the Europa League.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/24/brazilian-skill-criticise-flair-players-antony-neymar-richarlison-lucas-paqueta">Continue reading...</a>

Partizan Belgrade had been trying to sign him upon his graduation from Altina Zemun, a local academy, but could not reach a deal with the player’s family.</p><p>Next, Vlahovic had been taken to nearby OFK, where a brief spell ended in disagreement. Shortly afterwards Ristic, a youth coach at Partizan, heard Vlahovic had been spotted kicking a ball around alone at his local stadium. The boy needed to play, not for his talent to be squandered while adults wrangled around him.

But in the end Hudner, after calming a fire on Brown’s plane and hacking away at his cockpit with an ax for 45 minutes in the subzero weather, couldn’t free Brown from his jet, was ordered into a rescue helicopter before night fell (and visibility with it). Brown lost consciousness shortly thereafter; two days later, a squadron returned to pepper the crash site with napalm to keep Brown’s body and aircraft from falling into enemy hands.

<p>Half an hour with no decisions to make? That’s my idea of bliss</p><p>I had an MRI scan recently. There I lay, strapped in, with a roof tile laid on my chest. Would I like to listen to some music? No, ta. Then I was told it would take half an hour and I changed my mind about the music, but the bloke had gone. Silence it was. Silence, that is, apart from the weird, irregular clanking and banging noises these things make. It was a feet-first entry, which felt like being loaded into a canon for a daredevil stunt. There was also a lot of going in and out. At first I thought this was the bloke trying to pick the right spot but it turned out this was the nature of this particular scan – something to do with veins that I barely understood. In a bit, out a bit, all the way in, a bit out, all the way out, back in a bit, and so on.</p><p>It ought to have been stressful, but it wasn’t. It was the opposite.

They <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/22/australia-cruise-to-odi-whitewash-after-england-collapse-at-empty-mcg-cricket" title="">won the third game by 221 runs</a>, the largest ODI defeat in England’s history. A record, then, and not the game’s only one.

<p>Simone Signoret stars in a dark tale of love in the belle époque underworld that is a unmissable classic with a pitilessly grim finale</p><p>A 70th-anniversary rerelease for this film by a masterly French director who is known for his craftsmanship – but deserves also to be known for his artistry. Jacques Becker’s Casque d’Or is a gripping tragic drama of Parisian lowlife set at the turn of the century, based on news stories and apocryphal tales of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apaches_%28subculture%29">“apache” criminal gangs</a> that roamed the Paris underworld in the belle époque, terrifying and titillating those wealthy boulevardiers who liked to slum it in seedy dives.</p><p>Simone Signoret is glorious as Marie (nicknamed “Casque d’Or” for her golden helmet of hair); she is a woman of the night, based on the “gigolettes” tempting gentlemen into dark alleys, who would then be beaten and robbed by the woman’s male accomplices lurking behind her. Marie, though, never does anything so cruel here and has a heart, as well as a hairstyle, of gold. She is currently kept by Roland (William Sabatier), a sneery and insecure criminal, who takes offence in a bar when Marie likes the look of a quiet, personable carpenter called Georges (Serge Reggiani), who is going straight after some time inside and not looking for trouble. Marie and Georges fall deeply and tenderly in love, to the rage not only of spiteful beta-male Roland but his sinister gang-boss, Leca (Claude Dauphin), who uses his wine business as a respectable front and a means of bribing cops and is also enamoured of Marie. He has a plan to get this low-rank rival out of the way by having him convicted of murder.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/24/casque-dor-review-jacques-beckers-gripping-tragic-drama-of-parisian-lowlife">Continue reading...</a>

## Could hemp be a key tool in fight against climate change?

<p>The fast-growing plant is believed to be twice as effective as trees at absorbing and locking up carbon</p><p></p><p></p><p>In all the debates on how to curb climate change, hemp is hardly mentioned. Better known as cannabis, modern varieties of hemp are too weak to use as narcotics, but they are extremely efficient at absorbing and locking up carbon.<br /><br />Hemp is one of the fastest-growing plants in the world and can grow 4 metres high in 100 days. Research suggests hemp is twice as effective as trees at absorbing and locking up carbon, with 1 hectare (2.5 acres) of hemp reckoned to absorb 8 to 22 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> a year, more than any woodland. The CO<sub>2</sub> is also <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921344902001738">permanently fixed in the hemp fibres</a>, which can go on to be used for many commodities including textiles, medicines, insulation for buildings and concrete; BMW is even using it to replace plastics in various car parts.<br /><br />But unlike many other countries, the UK still classifies industrial hemp as a controlled drug, and growing the plant needs a Home Office licence. Cultivation in Britain is only about 800 hectares but work at the University of York and Biorenewables Development Centre aims to increase this to 80,000 hectares and make hemp a leading UK crop.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/24/could-hemp-be-a-key-tool-in-fight-against-climate-change">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For decades we have been using toys to cram learning into playtime – and toys have increasingly been marketed as helping to turn children into prosperous, high-achieving adults. But it turns out this approach is all wrong</p><p>The week my eldest son finished nursery, I decided to clear out the playroom where he had spent much of his young life forming bonds with inanimate objects. Toys had kept him company whenever other duties or distractions had occupied his mother and me, and over the years we had amassed a truly crass number of them. As I sifted through pile after pile, I felt as though I was in the pit of an immense archaeological dig. I had not considered us to be particularly pushy or indulgent parents; mostly, I wanted my children to grow up to be financially independent and live lives of nothing worse than common unhappiness. But the artefacts in our playroom midden told another tale.</p><p>Here is a partial inventory of what I found: 13 floor puzzles, including several meant to teach the alphabet. Two sets of magnetic tiles, along with dozens of figurines and matchbox cars, for constructive and imaginary play. Xylophones and tambourines to foster musical ability, and a smattering of finger paints to inspire artistic creativity. Four logic games and a set of dice for practising maths. A speaker box that could play Mozart or children’s versions of the Iliad and Odyssey. Endless Duplo.
