It was the end of term and we had spent weeks debating world politics; they were not uncritical or naive. But as fires ripped through homes and flood water lapped at people\u2019s stairs, with extreme weather driven by the climate crisis hitting countries around the world, they looked at the global scale of the economic and political forces driving capitalism and asked if that may be our best chance. If the system would have no other option but to course correct when faced with planetary collapse. Adrienne Buller\u2019s recent book, The Value of a Whale<em>,</em> dashes whatever hopes they might have had. Green capitalism will not save us, she argues \u2013 if anything, it is making the climate crisis worse.</p><p>Green capitalism may not be what you think it is. With much discussion about the danger of climate denial and the criticism of oil and gas companies\u2019 climate-conscious ads, Buller\u2019s book points to a shift that we risk missing. In the past decade, some capitalists have embraced green politics and not just for the sake of optics. Seeing the climate crisis as an unprecedented threat to capitalism, they don\u2019t want to disprove its existence but solve it. As an example, read the annual letter from the <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter\">BlackRock CEO, Larry Fink</a>. Their approaches \u2013 \u201cprices, markets and clever financial products\u201d, Buller writes \u2013 are now \u201cguiding much of the global response to the ecological crisis\u201d. In Buller\u2019s reading, then, my students\u2019 optimism was at least partially founded: capitalists have woken up to the problem.

Here, at last, was the David Bowie who knew exactly what he was doing, who was no longer pretending to be a hippy, or a proponent of \u201cheavy\u201d music, or an Anthony Newley-ish all-round entertainer; the Bowie who would so confidently cut through the coming decade that pop music and youth culture were both changed in his wake.</p><p>The truth, as revealed by Divine Symmetry \u2013 a beautifully packaged 4CD box set subtitled An Alternative Journey Through Hunky Dory \u2013 appears to have been substantially less straightforward than that.

But the commitment and passion of its two lead performers, Emma Corrin and Jack O\u2019Connell, carries this new version of DH Lawrence\u2019s Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover, and the actor turned director Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre finds the keynote of idealism. The film is never shy of eroticism and full-on sex, if sometimes going for a slightly quaint soft-focus approach. But Clermont-Tonnerre is never in any doubt that this is a love story. The last adaptation of any note was from another French film-maker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/24/worldcinema.romance\">Pascale Ferran\u2019s flawed Lady Chatterley</a> (based on an earlier version of the book). Perhaps it takes a French and not a British director to respond to Lawrence\u2019s forbidden tale of forbidden love.<br /><br />It is the middle of the first world war and Constance Reid (Corrin) is the beautiful and impulsive young woman of upper-class birth and progressive views who, after a chequered emotional past, honestly believes herself to be in love with Sir Clifford Chatterley; they get married before he has to return to the front, hardly knowing each other at all. At the war\u2019s end, he is a gloomier figure, using a wheelchair after a terrible war injury, and it is in a sombre mood that the new Lady Chatterley is to arrive with him at Wragby, his vast country estate, paid for by the sweated labour at his colliery.</p><p>There, she is alienated from the friends he invites up from London for the weekend. Sir Clifford is a shallow, meretricious figure: after dabbling in writing fiction, he throws himself into making his colliery even more profitable by laying off some miners and exploiting the rest more ruthlessly.<strong> </strong>This impotent plutocrat is coldly obsessed with producing an heir, making it clear to the bewildered Constance that he will permit her to have a discreet affair if that produces the correct result. As it happens, Constance has become obsessed with the handsome gamekeeper, Mellors (vehemently played by O\u2019Connell, who maintains his character\u2019s dignity). He is the only person in her life capable of human sympathy.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/24/lady-chatterleys-lover-review-sensuality-as-an-almost-religious-revelation\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/24/my-soul-twin-by-nino-haratischvili-review-the-curse-of-the-past", "title": "My Soul Twin by Nino Haratischvili review \u2013 the curse of the past", "date_published": "2022-11-24 09:00:23+00:00", "description": "<p>Childhood soulmates reunite in later life in this passionate novel from The Eighth Life author</p><p>No one was more attuned to the paradoxes of love than Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke. \u201cTogetherness between two people is an impossibility,\u201d he wrote in<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/12/letters-rainer-maria-rilke-review\" title=\"\">Letters to a Young Poet</a>. \u201cBut, once the realisation is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue to exist, a wonderful living side by side can grow up, if they succeed in loving the distance between them.\u201d</p><p>This paradox \u2013 of the twinned closeness and alienation in lovers \u2013 is at the heart of Nino Haratischvili\u2019s My Soul Twin<em>,</em> her second novel to be translated into English after the huge success of her award-winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/04/the-eighth-life-for-brilka-by-nino-haratischivili-review\" title=\"\">The Eighth Life</a>, a 900-page saga that chronicled Georgia\u2019s plight under Soviet occupation and subsequent struggle for independence.
