  <p id="Aqrjma">Twitter CEO Elon Musk has decided <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1595869526469533701?s=46&amp;t=BIIzeMUAVRYULYTY1hAQQA">to offer “general amnesty” to suspended accounts</a> — a gentler way of saying that he’s decided to welcome back some of the site’s worst and most toxic people. It’s the second major moderation decision he’s made since taking over after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/19/23467280/donald-trump-twitter-back-elon-musk-poll">unbanning former President Donald Trump</a>; both decisions were made after Musk <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/23/23475472/elon-musk-twitter-unbanning-suspended-accounts-law-spam-amnesty">ran an informal poll</a> from his personal Twitter account.</p>
<p id="wfi6X8">The decision to reverse years of moderation work at Twitter effectively trashes Musk’s original promise: to create a diverse council that would help adjudicate serious moderation decisions. Musk backed away from that idea by later blaming “political/social activist groups” for breaking an alleged “deal” — a claim nobody has verified <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/22/elon-musk-has-himself-to-blame-for-twitter-ad-woes-activists-say.html">and that...</a></p>

  <p id="hja7Hg">This week, astronomers announced that they’d found evidence of chemical reactions in the atmosphere of an exoplanet 700 light years away from Earth. Researchers using the James Webb Space Telescope created a detailed chemical portrait of the scorching gases swirling around exoplanet WASP-39b. This “hot Saturn” planet orbits extremely close to its host star, meaning it has high temperatures of up to 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit or 900 degrees Celsius. It is also puffy, with around one quarter the mass of Jupiter but 1.3 times its size. </p>
<p id="6d1uoF">Early data about WASP-39b was shared this summer when JWST <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/webb-telescope-finds-carbon-dioxide-on-a-distant-exoplanet/">detected carbon dioxide in its atmosphere</a> — the first time this gas had been detected on a planet outside our solar system.

In <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/637cecede90e076b8043d8cd/Sony_Interactive_Entertainment.pdf">a filing</a> with the UK’s competition regulator, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/microsoft-slash-activision-blizzard-merger-inquiry">the Competition and Markets Authority</a> (CMA) Sony argues that <em>Call of Duty</em> is a uniquely important franchise to have on PlayStation consoles, and can’t be replaced by the likes of <em>Battlefield</em>.
