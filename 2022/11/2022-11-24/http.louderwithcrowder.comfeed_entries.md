At least this Santa <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nerf-guns-santa-boy-cry" target="_blank">wasn't a jerkface making a little boy cry</a>. Also, the gun in question is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/show-notes-santa-claus-commie" target="_blank">most definitely NOT a Nerf</a>. We go now to a California mall. Lots of customers were inside getting their holiday shopping on. Unbeknownst to them, three nogoodniks were in the parking lot doing some holiday shopping of their own — something with four wheels and no monthly payments. That's when they discovered they were about to have a very bad day. This mall is patrolled by St. Nick and his trusty sidekick Tipsy McFluffytoes. Tipsy appears to have a concealed carry license.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Santa has a good toy game, but he's also a pretty good crime fighter too! Check out this tackle! <a href="https://t.co/16RYTtukXA">pic.twitter.com/16RYTtukXA</a><br />— Dana Wagner (@DanaNews3LV) <a href="https://twitter.com/DanaNews3LV/status/1338501460590436352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2020</a></blockquote> </div><p>Before the grinch fact-checkers get their hands on this, I can't confirm the elf's name. But I played around with a name generator, and it sounded magical. Have some Christmas spirit! Also from the <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/riverside-undercover-santa-tackles-thieves/2483392/?amp" target="_blank">local NBC Affiliate</a>, there was more to this Santa Claus and companion than met the eye:</p><blockquote>Det. Paul Miranda was one of several Riverside police officers working undercover Thursday at Target in the Canyon Springs Shopping Center.<br /><br />"We worked inside the store, identified shoplifters and when they split the scene, Santa was there to take them into custody," Miranda said.<br /><br />Santa is a detective and his trusty sidekick elf, an officer. Both jumped into action when Miranda spotted a car being stolen from the parking lot as two other men ran from the scene.</blockquote><p>The real hero in this story is the guy yelling "Get 'em, Santa" from behind his trusty smartphone. Had it not been for him, we'd have no idea this story took place. Be honest, seeing Santa blockbuster suplex a perp put a smile on your face. Find the joy in the little things this Chrstmas season!</p><p><p>

## The WH wants you to start a fight at Thanksgiving, but enjoy the classic "Cheers" food fight instead

	Girl, no.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">It’s hard to quit talking politics cold turkey — even at Thanksgiving. Talk to your family from across the aisle, and across your dinner table, with this cheat sheet. <a href="https://t.co/0KLii3kiGJ">pic.twitter.com/0KLii3kiGJ</a><br />— Karine Jean-Pierre (@PressSec) <a href="https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/1595507114977464348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>There are many articles on the Internet about "How to Survive Talking Politics at Thanksgiving Dinner." Because "just don't talk about it" isn't long enough for SEO. So, while you enter what could be trench warfare on Thursday, just remember it could be a lot worse. Like this classic <em>Cheers</em> episode of the Thanksgiving food fight.<br /></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">
<span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"></span>
</p><p>
	That's the benchmark for surviving Thanksgiving. If you don't wind up with a face full of mashed potatoes, it was a rather successful dinner.
</p><p>
	It's not always possible to have a politics-free family gathering. Further complicating things is what I call the Soy Theorem. Which theorizes that if it's something Americans generally enjoy--like a day celebrating food, football, and booze--there are leftists somewhere trying to ruin it for everyone. You may find yourself stuck with that leftist cousin no one likes, home from another semester at a liberal arts college. They may have thoughts about <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/top-five-liberal-meltdowns-rittenhouse" target="_blank">the Kyle Rittenhouse Case</a>. Or be upset over the cool uncle with the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/f-joe-biden/" target="_blank">F*ck Joe Biden bumper sticker</a>. In a perfect world, the little twerp would be told to stifle it. Go sit in the corner with their free-range vegan tofurkey and keep their opinions to themselves. But life doesn't always work out that way. Suddenly, the family is taking sides.
</p><p>
	Now, everyone go back to  your corners. When the bell rings, come out for dinner!

## 'As God as my witness...': Start your Thanksgiving with the infamous 'WKRP in Cincinnati' turkey drop

One involves a bottle of Pappy I partake in once a year. I sit on the porch with bourbon and a cigar and reflect on the things for which I am most thankful. Mostly bourbon. And <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-prank-names" target="_blank">content</a>. Sweet, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-poop-wrestling" target="_blank">sweet content</a>. I drink my way through whatever lame football matchups are on and wonder what kind of a God would force his children to sit through Joe Buck talking. At some point, I eat. This year I'll be skipping the Thanksgiving Turkey and instead be making the Thanksgiving Waygu Tri-Tip, smoked over mesquite wood.  Try not to be jealous while pretending Aunt Bertha's turkey isn't dry AF.</p><p>But the day is always started with reliving the infamous WKRP in Cincinnati Turkey Drop of 1978. Since you and I both know you were going to look for this video, too:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube"><span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"></span></p><p>They sent Les Nessman to a strip mall, so Herb and Mr. Carlson could throw turkeys out of a helicopter. In 2021, PETA would be involved. MSNBC would claim this was white supremacy. And Les, instead of almost being killed by a man and his two children, would be yelled at for not wearing a mask.</p><p>Aaaand the money quote:</p><blockquote>As God as my witness, I thought turkeys could fly.</blockquote><p>Quite frankly, that was the greatest marketing stunt this side of giving away a hand-etched mug with every annual subscription to the world's greatest political comedy show.</p><p>From all of us here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website, have a Happy Thanksgiving!</p><p><p><em><strong>Need a quick laugh?</strong> Check out and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMAtX9eFBpwc4LtgvbqsOpQ?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">subscribe to our CrowderBits YouTube channel</a> for Louder with Crowder skits, opens, and parody videos!</em></p></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">
