Decided to build a fun predictions website where you could bet virtual (not real) money on predictions made by others, and also make predictions of your own.<p>Building it turned out to be considerably easier and more fun than I anticipated.<p>Primary tools used were:<p># QuickEdit as the mobile code editor (Note: the free version of the QuickEdit app is riddled with ads, it shows an advert each time you close a tab, but it unfortunately had the best UI of the 3 or so Android code editors I tested. Ended up using NetGuard to block it from retrieving & displaying ads),<p># PHP for the Backend ( custom PHP microframework I've used and built on over the past few years ).<p># jQuery for the frontend js (<i>cringing</i>) - it appears I'm simply too lazy to learn React/Vue/et al. Every once in a while, I pick one of them to learn, but I always end up returning to jQuery - or time-permitting - amateur level vanilla JS.<p># Bootstrap for the CSS - Battle-tested. For a purely backend dev with minimal design skills, good ol' Bootstrap (and in a growing number of cases, Tailwind) is always a life saver.<p># Whole thing is hosted on 2 VMs (1 hosting the web app, and 1 hosting Redis & MySQL).<p># As to the site itself, it turned out to be pretty cool to play around with. Go there, view the predictions, bet on the predictions you believe will come true, or against the ones you think will not. You get $50,000 to bet with (not real money). No signup is required to bet, but a quick signup is required to make a prediction. Hope you guys like it, and please be ruthless in telling me of any bugs you've found.<p>So go on here => kudotap.com<p>And Have Fun!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33736245\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33736245</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33736133", "title": "Ask HN: Is it just me?", "date_published": "2022-11-24 20:56:06+00:00", "description": "<p>Over my whole career I can see a pattern.<p>Typically, I work for an employer for around 3 to 5 years. At the start of each employment I make several successful leaps, often designing and building new systems (usually single handedly). I am rewarded with various pay rises, bonuses and promotions. Then around the halfway mark or later, things sour for a variety of different reasons. Typically, I will fall out with someone senior, like my line manager. It's normally over something mundane but definitely technical.<p>In each cycle I try resolving things in different ways but each time I fail; then I desperately try finding a new role with the knowledge that the whole process might repeat itself.<p>I can recall the various reasons the fallouts occured, e.g. frustrated by a boss's crony cancelling 3rd party supplier contracts (which I had to grovel to reinstate), having differing views about testing/automation (I am fond of both), how workloads should be spread more fairly, etc. There are many different reasons.<p>In the more recent cycles I just end up being entirely unproductive at the end.<p>Is it just me?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Indeed, even \"general purpose\" programming languages are, in a sense, DSLs for ... math (Fortran), gofai (Lisp), etc. And of course there are zillions of more specific DSLs. The purpose of a DSL is to reduce the complexity of writing code for the target domain, which usually involves specialized vocabulary, functionality, and syntax. But the most complex programs that exist (well, at least among them) are operating systems. Yet we still build them in general purposes languages, like C. Of course, we almost immediately build a layer of functionality on the hardware and system services, but even when you get to the top, like programming bash commands, it's largely done in C (for Unix-likes). I'm wondering whether/why there isn't a DSL for operating systems. (Or maybe there is, but it's hard to find if so; I've never seen one, and it's a difficult set of phrases to search the web for, so I might be just missing the obvious, for which I apologize in advance, and appreciate the pointers.)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33734299\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33734299</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33734259", "title": "Ask HN: Books about full text search", "date_published": "2022-11-24 17:58:39+00:00", "description": "<p>I would love to learn more about FTS at a very low level and I'm looking for books to read more on that topic.

There are multiple ideas or projects which are left because they don't have potential to scale. They are very specific to a niche set of customers or teams. Many people wanted to work on the solution but dropped off as they had bigger fishes to fry or knew the idea wouldn't scale. But the idea would scale up to a certain limit.<p>e.g. https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/08/man-who-built-isp-instead-of-paying-comcast-50k-expands-to-hundreds-of-homes/<p>I believe that every village needs to solve their own problem and and may be in a different way(based upon the resources they have) as the external help may not arrive. The solution also need not go to cities as it is very specific to the village. This man got a project working after passing the initial inertia.
