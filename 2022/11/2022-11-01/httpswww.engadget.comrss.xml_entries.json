Musk appeared to reconsider pricing after a tweet from author Stephen King criticizing the plan went viral. \"We need to pay the bills somehow,\" Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587312517679878144?s=20&amp;t=xlgFt27tFVmaEWVma0svqA\">said</a>. \"Twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers. How about $8?\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Musk claimed the changes to Twitter Blue would also give the company a way to support content creators. On Monday, the owner of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nibellion\">Nibellion</a>, one of Twitter's most prolific and popular gaming news accounts, said he was <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/nibel-nibellion-twitter-patreon-elon-musk-gaming-news-1849722335\">abandoning the platform</a>, citing Musk's takeover of the company and the difficulty he encountered monetizing his work. \u201cI have miscalculated the value of my Twitter activity and realize that it is nothing worth supporting by itself for the vast majority of people,\" Nibel said. \"It is not me who is popular, but it is that work that is useful.

After nearly 40 years and <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/culture/crosley-revolution-resurrects-the-sound-burger/\">countless clones</a>, the updated model adds a few new features to make it more appealing to modern listeners. To start, the 2022 Sound Burger includes Bluetooth connectivity and a built-in lithium-ion battery with USB-C charging. In other words, you won\u2019t need to source a trio of C-cell batteries to power the new model. According to Audio-Technica, you can expect to get about 12 hours of continuous playback from the 2022 Sound Burger before it needs to be charged.</p><p>The company has tweaked the design of the turntable in a few other ways. For one, you won\u2019t find an extendable cord hanger for your headphones. Speaking of headphones, the 2022 model doesn\u2019t come with a complimentary pair like its predecessor. However, it will ship with an RCA cable if you prefer to physically connect the turntable to your sound system. The 2022 model also comes stock with an Audio-Technica <a href=\"https://www.audio-technica.com/en-ca/atn3600l\">ATN3600L</a> stylus.

One of them, the basic 10th-generation iPad, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-10th-generation-review-160014897.html\">was rebuilt from the ground up</a>. The new iPad Pro, on the other hand, is a much simpler update. The company took <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2021-m1-review-liquid-retina-xdr-5g-features-price-130049005.html\">last year\u2019s model</a>, swapped the M1 chip for the M2, made a few other small tweaks, and called it a day. The iPad Pro is still ludicrously fast, and it\u2019s still extremely expensive, starting at $799 for the 11-inch model and $1,099 for the 12.9-inch.</p><p>I can\u2019t really fault Apple for this approach, though. Even though the basic design of the iPad Pro was first introduced in 2018, it\u2019s still a marvelously engineered piece of hardware. It features one of the best screens Apple has ever made, and it continues to surprise me that the company can pack so much power into such a compact frame.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>While this year\u2019s model closely resembles what Apple was already selling, it does arrive at a significant time for the iPad\u2019s evolution. That is thanks to iPadOS 16, which launched last week. For most iPads, it\u2019s the expected collection of useful improvements \u2014 but for the iPad Pro, it offers an entirely new multitasking system called Stage Manager. It\u2019s a clear response to the question we tech reviewers (and many iPad Pro owners) have been asking for years: When will we get software that lets us take advantage of the iPad\u2019s power?</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p>First, a quick refresher. The iPad Pro is still available in two sizes: 11 and 12.9 inches. Storage options range from a modest 128GB up to a truly outrageous 2TB, and you can configure it with an optional 5G radio for when there\u2019s no WiFi. And for when you\u2019re at home, it supports the WiFi 6E, whereas last year\u2019s model was limited to WiFi 6. As usual, we reviewers get to play with a near top-of-the-line iPad: the 12.9-inch model with 1TB of storage and 5G service from Verizon. This iPad Pro costs a jaw-dropping $1,999, and that\u2019s before you add on the $129 Apple Pencil and $349 Magic Keyboard. We\u2019re well into MacBook Pro or Mac Studio territory at this point.</p><div id=\"a209a9091d4e4cfba6652017cddb1839\"></div><p>At least the iPad Pro still feels like a device worth that kind of money. (Whether it <em>is</em> is a different question.) The fit and finish remains exceptional, and while the 1.5-pound weight makes it a bit more of a burden to hold compared to smaller and lighter iPad models, I\u2019m still impressed at Apple\u2019s ability to cram such performance into a device that\u2019s so compact. There are other well-designed tablets on the market, but I still don\u2019t think anyone has caught up to the iPad Pro.</p><p>The 11-inch model still has to make do with the same Liquid Retina LCD display it\u2019s had for a few years now, but the 12.9-inch version has the Liquid Retina XDR panel that was first introduced on the M1 iPad Pro in May of 2021. This screen uses mini-LED backlighting to offer 2,596 local dimming zones to offer a wide dynamic range and a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio. It also has up to 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness and 1,600 nits peak brightness when playing back HDR content, which can really make movies pop.</p><figure><img alt=\"Apple iPad Pro (2022) \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/bf495041-59e1-11ed-b3f7-218306906c07\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>There\u2019s nothing new about the screen this year, but it\u2019s worth highlighting just how good it is. Both iPad Pro models also have the 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate; support for the P3 wide color gamut; a screen that\u2019s fully laminated to the front glass; and an anti-reflective coating.</p><p>Just like last year, the iPad Pro has an ultrawide 12-megapixel front-facing camera that supports Face ID authentication. This wide-angle camera supports Center Stage, which crops and zooms around your face to keep you in the middle of the frame on a video call. That\u2019s all well and good, but unfortunately the iPad Pro still has its front-facing camera on the portrait edge of the screen, which means you\u2019re always going to be somewhat off-center and not looking directly at the screen if your iPad is in a keyboard dock. This has been true of all iPads for years already, but now that the basic model has gotten a landscape-oriented camera, we\u2019re going to be waiting impatiently for Apple to implement that across its entire lineup.</p><p>The back cameras are also the same: There are 12-megapixel wide and 10-megapixel ultra wide options, along with a flash and LIDAR scanner. However, the M2 processor unlocks a new video trick, as the iPad Pro can now record video in Apple\u2019s ProRes codec in 4K resolution at 30 frames per second, a feature first introduced in the iPhone 13 Pro. This is admittedly something of a niche feature, but it shows off the M2\u2019s improvements over its predecessor.</p><h2></h2><figure><img alt=\"Apple iPad Pro (2022) \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/bf495040-59e1-11ed-97fb-0889342a5fa9\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Accessories</h2><p>From an accessories standpoint, the iPad Pro uses the same 2nd-generation Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard that have been available since 2018 and 2020, respectively. The Magic Keyboard still provides the best typing experience you can find on an iPad, though the whole package is pretty heavy. It\u2019s also crazy expensive, as I already mentioned. And now that the basic iPad\u2019s new Magic Keyboard Folio offers a row of function keys and a slightly bigger trackpad, I\u2019m really missing those features here. But if you make your living with words, as I do, it\u2019s still an essential tool.</p><p>The Apple Pencil remains a tool that I\u2019m not particularly great at evaluating, because I am sorely lacking in visual arts skills. I sure wish I could sit down and sketch and doodle and make the wonderful creations I\u2019ve seen others do, but that\u2019s not happening. If you\u2019re a visual artist, chances are you already know how well the Pencil works, though.</p><p>The M2 on the new iPad Pro also enabled a new trick called Hover. If the Pencil is within 12mm of the screen, icons and interface elements can react to it. The most simple example is how app icons increase in size when you hover the Pencil over, showing you what you're about to tap on. This works system-wide, at least in Apple apps. Third-party developers will have to build Hover features into their apps, but it should be a nice new tool in the Pencil\u2019s arsenal. One place I was able to demo it was in the Notes app; when using the new watercolor brush, you can hover the pencil over the screen to see how the color will react with other elements you\u2019ve already drawn.</p><p>I found another cool Hover implementation in the excellent image-editing app Pixelmator Photo. Hovering and moving the Pencil across a strip of different filters at the bottom of the app automatically applies them as a preview. It\u2019s wickedly fast and a fun way to see what your picture will look like. That said, it\u2019s something you could already do with the trackpad and pointer; so far, a lot of Hover actions I\u2019ve seen are straight up clones of what you can do when hovering over an interface element with the trackpad. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what developers come up with going forward, though.</p><section><img alt=\"Apple iPad Pro (2022) \" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/bf492930-59e1-11ed-bc5e-2557ef9b459e\" /></section><h2>M2</h2><p>But let\u2019s get into that M2 processor, shall we? Thanks to our review of the M2 MacBook Air earlier this summer, we had a good idea of what to expect here. And running Geekbench 5 tests confirmed it. The M2 iPad Pro scored 1,888 and 8,419 on single-core and multicore CPU tests, respectively. Those are 12 percent and 42 percent better than the same tests on the M1 iPad Pro, and similar to the 18 percent and 38 percent gains we saw when comparing the M2 MacBook Air to its M1-powered sibling.</p><p>I saw similar improvements in the Geekbench 5 Compute test, which measures GPU performance. The M2 iPad Pro scored 32,834 \u2013 52 percent better than the M1 model and a bit higher than the 27,083 we saw in the M2 MacBook Air\u2019s test. Obviously, synthetic benchmarks like this aren\u2019t the be-all and end-all way to judge performance, but it gives you an idea of what to expect. If you regularly push an M1 iPad Pro to its limits and use it in a setting where your time equals money, these improvements might justify upgrading, but unless your workflow is extremely demanding you can probably skip this generation. When you consider the fact that the iPad Pro\u2019s basic design hasn\u2019t changed since 2018, that\u2019s another reason to hold off; it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Apple released an all-new Pro in the next year or so.</p><h2>Stage manager</h2><p>Finally, there\u2019s the not-so-small addition of iPadOS 16, and more specifically Stage Manager. As a reminder, Stage Manager lets you have up to four apps open in one group at once, with overlapping, resizable windows. Four other groups (with up to four apps in each) show up on the left side of the screen, based on how recently you\u2019ve used them. Only a select few iPads can run Stage Manager: The iPad Pro with either an M1 or M2, the M1-powered iPad Air that was released earlier this year, or the 2018 and 2020 iPad Pro models running on the A12X or A12Z chip. (Those older iPad Pro models won\u2019t be able to use Stage Manager on an external display; that\u2019s limited to M1 or M2 devices.)</p><p>Ever since Stage Manager arrived in beta versions of iPadOS 16 earlier this year, there\u2019s been a lot of chatter among the iPad faithful about Apple\u2019s execution. On one end of the spectrum you have someone like Federico Viticci over at Macstores.net \u2014 he\u2019s well known for being a devout iPad Pro user and writes massive, detailed breakdowns of each iOS and iPadOS release. Viticci, to put it mildly, <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/stage-manager-ipados-16-1-review/\">is not a fan of Stage Manager</a>; he wrote around 10,000 words detailing its inconsistencies and bugs.</p><p>On the other hand, I have not run into nearly the same scale of difficulties as Viticci, but I recognize his overall point. There are probably too many different ways to do things in Stage Manager (like adding a new app to a group); window management is more restrictive compared to a Mac (or Windows, or ChromeOS); and the behavior of the Control Strip on the left side of the screen remains confusing. Stage Manager feels like a work in progress \u2014 but when it works, I have created app groupings that make me a lot more efficient and productive than I was using the standard two-app Split View multitasking mode with a third app in a small \u201cSlide Over\u201d window.</p><p>And while Stage Manager was (and still may be) buggy, I at least have run into a lot fewer problems here on the M2 iPad Pro with the final iPadOS 16.1 release. I\u2019ve been working on this iPad for the entirety of my work day and think I\u2019ve only had one app crash on me (Gmail, which isn\u2019t exactly the best iPad app on its best days). There are some conceptual things about Stage Manager I\u2019m still grappling with, like the best way to add or remove apps from a group, but I think the experience is worth spending a day or two with to see if you can find your flow.</p><figure><img alt=\"Apple iPad Pro (2022) \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/bf495040-59e1-11ed-a74d-0924f57e9b11\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>There\u2019s no question that the new iPad Pro is better than its predecessor. It\u2019s the same price and comes with a more powerful chip as well as a few additional features. That said, I think it\u2019s not as sure a bet as the last iPad Pro was when it came out in early 2021. That\u2019s primarily because of the iPad Pro\u2019s design, which has remained essentially unchanged for the last four years. That\u2019s good news in some ways, because you could have bought an Apple Pencil in 2018 and a Magic Keyboard in 2020 and still use them with the M2 iPad Pro.</p><p>But at a certain point, probably not too long from now, Apple will advance the form factor yet again. Not that it necessarily needs to; the iPad Pro remains well designed and continues to be a standout performer, as it should be for the price. But that landscape-edge front camera on the 10th-generation iPad tells me that we\u2019ll see an iPad Pro before long with a more substantial redesign and not just one with a faster chip inside.</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2022-m2-review-140026198-140026510-140026377-140026181.html?src=rss", "title": "Apple iPad Pro review (2022): An impressive stopgap", "date_published": "2022-11-01 14:00:26+00:00", "description": "<p>Apple just released two new iPads.

The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJKTEJLTVY4P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTJsLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxNmQ1ODE1Zi0zZDM5LTQ4MWUtYmZiMC0xMDk1MGJmMGQ1ZjEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaUpWFeSyrqCMXpwuFx49TN6HPTkcNWiWi2d4go6RS3J&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLBKMV8\">new iPad Pro</a>, on the other hand, is a much simpler update. The company took <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2021-m1-review-liquid-retina-xdr-5g-features-price-130049005.html\">last year\u2019s model</a>, swapped the M1 chip for the M2, made a few other small tweaks, and called it a day. The iPad Pro is still ludicrously fast, and it\u2019s still extremely expensive, starting at $799 for the 11-inch model and $1,099 for the 12.9-inch.</p><p>I can\u2019t really fault Apple for this approach, though. Even though the basic design of the iPad Pro was first introduced in 2018, it\u2019s still a marvelously engineered piece of hardware. It features one of the best screens Apple has ever made, and it continues to surprise me that the company can pack so much power into such a compact frame.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>While this year\u2019s model closely resembles what Apple was already selling, it does arrive at a significant time for the iPad\u2019s evolution. That is thanks to iPadOS 16, which launched last week. For most iPads, it\u2019s the expected collection of useful improvements \u2014 but for the iPad Pro, it offers an entirely new multitasking system called Stage Manager. It\u2019s a clear response to the question we tech reviewers (and many iPad Pro owners) have been asking for years: When will we get software that lets us take advantage of the iPad\u2019s power?</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p>First, a quick refresher. The iPad Pro is still available in two sizes: 11 and 12.9 inches. Storage options range from a modest 128GB up to a truly outrageous 2TB, and you can configure it with an optional 5G radio for when there\u2019s no WiFi. And for when you\u2019re at home, it supports the WiFi 6E, whereas last year\u2019s model was limited to WiFi 6. As usual, we reviewers get to play with a near top-of-the-line iPad: the 12.9-inch model with 1TB of storage and 5G service from Verizon. This iPad Pro costs a jaw-dropping $1,999, and that\u2019s before you add on the $129 Apple Pencil and $349 Magic Keyboard. We\u2019re well into MacBook Pro or Mac Studio territory at this point.</p><div id=\"a209a9091d4e4cfba6652017cddb1839\"></div><p>At least the iPad Pro still feels like a device worth that kind of money. (Whether it <em>is</em> is a different question.) The fit and finish remains exceptional, and while the 1.5-pound weight makes it a bit more of a burden to hold compared to smaller and lighter iPad models, I\u2019m still impressed at Apple\u2019s ability to cram such performance into a device that\u2019s so compact. There are other well-designed tablets on the market, but I still don\u2019t think anyone has caught up to the iPad Pro.</p><p>The 11-inch model still has to make do with the same Liquid Retina LCD display it\u2019s had for a few years now, but the 12.9-inch version has the Liquid Retina XDR panel that was first introduced on the M1 iPad Pro in May of 2021. This screen uses mini-LED backlighting to offer 2,596 local dimming zones to offer a wide dynamic range and a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio. It also has up to 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness and 1,600 nits peak brightness when playing back HDR content, which can really make movies pop.</p><figure><img alt=\"Apple iPad Pro (2022) \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/bf495041-59e1-11ed-b3f7-218306906c07\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>There\u2019s nothing new about the screen this year, but it\u2019s worth highlighting just how good it is. Both iPad Pro models also have the 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate; support for the P3 wide color gamut; a screen that\u2019s fully laminated to the front glass; and an anti-reflective coating.</p><p>Just like last year, the iPad Pro has an ultrawide 12-megapixel front-facing camera that supports Face ID authentication. This wide-angle camera supports Center Stage, which crops and zooms around your face to keep you in the middle of the frame on a video call. That\u2019s all well and good, but unfortunately the iPad Pro still has its front-facing camera on the portrait edge of the screen, which means you\u2019re always going to be somewhat off-center and not looking directly at the screen if your iPad is in a keyboard dock. This has been true of all iPads for years already, but now that the basic model has gotten a landscape-oriented camera, we\u2019re going to be waiting impatiently for Apple to implement that across its entire lineup.</p><p>The back cameras are also the same: There are 12-megapixel wide and 10-megapixel ultra wide options, along with a flash and LIDAR scanner. However, the M2 processor unlocks a new video trick, as the iPad Pro can now record video in Apple\u2019s ProRes codec in 4K resolution at 30 frames per second, a feature first introduced in the iPhone 13 Pro. This is admittedly something of a niche feature, but it shows off the M2\u2019s improvements over its predecessor.</p><h2></h2><figure><img alt=\"Apple iPad Pro (2022) \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/bf495040-59e1-11ed-97fb-0889342a5fa9\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Accessories</h2><p>From an accessories standpoint, the iPad Pro uses the same 2nd-generation Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard that have been available since 2018 and 2020, respectively. The Magic Keyboard still provides the best typing experience you can find on an iPad, though the whole package is pretty heavy. It\u2019s also crazy expensive, as I already mentioned. And now that the basic iPad\u2019s new Magic Keyboard Folio offers a row of function keys and a slightly bigger trackpad, I\u2019m really missing those features here. But if you make your living with words, as I do, it\u2019s still an essential tool.</p><p>The Apple Pencil remains a tool that I\u2019m not particularly great at evaluating, because I am sorely lacking in visual arts skills. I sure wish I could sit down and sketch and doodle and make the wonderful creations I\u2019ve seen others do, but that\u2019s not happening. If you\u2019re a visual artist, chances are you already know how well the Pencil works, though.</p><p>The M2 on the new iPad Pro also enabled a new trick called Hover. If the Pencil is within 12mm of the screen, icons and interface elements can react to it. The most simple example is how app icons increase in size when you hover the Pencil over, showing you what you're about to tap on. This works system-wide, at least in Apple apps. Third-party developers will have to build Hover features into their apps, but it should be a nice new tool in the Pencil\u2019s arsenal. One place I was able to demo it was in the Notes app; when using the new watercolor brush, you can hover the pencil over the screen to see how the color will react with other elements you\u2019ve already drawn.</p><p>I found another cool Hover implementation in the excellent image-editing app Pixelmator Photo. Hovering and moving the Pencil across a strip of different filters at the bottom of the app automatically applies them as a preview. It\u2019s wickedly fast and a fun way to see what your picture will look like. That said, it\u2019s something you could already do with the trackpad and pointer; so far, a lot of Hover actions I\u2019ve seen are straight up clones of what you can do when hovering over an interface element with the trackpad. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what developers come up with going forward, though.</p><section><img alt=\"Apple iPad Pro (2022) \" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/bf492930-59e1-11ed-bc5e-2557ef9b459e\" /></section><h2>M2</h2><p>But let\u2019s get into that M2 processor, shall we? Thanks to our review of the M2 MacBook Air earlier this summer, we had a good idea of what to expect here. And running Geekbench 5 tests confirmed it. The M2 iPad Pro scored 1,888 and 8,419 on single-core and multicore CPU tests, respectively. Those are 12 percent and 42 percent better than the same tests on the M1 iPad Pro, and similar to the 18 percent and 38 percent gains we saw when comparing the M2 MacBook Air to its M1-powered sibling.</p><p>I saw similar improvements in the Geekbench 5 Compute test, which measures GPU performance. The M2 iPad Pro scored 32,834 \u2013 52 percent better than the M1 model and a bit higher than the 27,083 we saw in the M2 MacBook Air\u2019s test. Obviously, synthetic benchmarks like this aren\u2019t the be-all and end-all way to judge performance, but it gives you an idea of what to expect. If you regularly push an M1 iPad Pro to its limits and use it in a setting where your time equals money, these improvements might justify upgrading, but unless your workflow is extremely demanding you can probably skip this generation. When you consider the fact that the iPad Pro\u2019s basic design hasn\u2019t changed since 2018, that\u2019s another reason to hold off; it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Apple released an all-new Pro in the next year or so.</p><h2>Stage manager</h2><p>Finally, there\u2019s the not-so-small addition of iPadOS 16, and more specifically Stage Manager. As a reminder, Stage Manager lets you have up to four apps open in one group at once, with overlapping, resizable windows. Four other groups (with up to four apps in each) show up on the left side of the screen, based on how recently you\u2019ve used them. Only a select few iPads can run Stage Manager: The iPad Pro with either an M1 or M2, the M1-powered iPad Air that was released earlier this year, or the 2018 and 2020 iPad Pro models running on the A12X or A12Z chip. (Those older iPad Pro models won\u2019t be able to use Stage Manager on an external display; that\u2019s limited to M1 or M2 devices.)</p><p>Ever since Stage Manager arrived in beta versions of iPadOS 16 earlier this year, there\u2019s been a lot of chatter among the iPad faithful about Apple\u2019s execution. On one end of the spectrum you have someone like Federico Viticci over at Macstores.net \u2014 he\u2019s well known for being a devout iPad Pro user and writes massive, detailed breakdowns of each iOS and iPadOS release. Viticci, to put it mildly, <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/stage-manager-ipados-16-1-review/\">is not a fan of Stage Manager</a>; he wrote around 10,000 words detailing its inconsistencies and bugs.</p><p>On the other hand, I have not run into nearly the same scale of difficulties as Viticci, but I recognize his overall point. There are probably too many different ways to do things in Stage Manager (like adding a new app to a group); window management is more restrictive compared to a Mac (or Windows, or ChromeOS); and the behavior of the Control Strip on the left side of the screen remains confusing. Stage Manager feels like a work in progress \u2014 but when it works, I have created app groupings that make me a lot more efficient and productive than I was using the standard two-app Split View multitasking mode with a third app in a small \u201cSlide Over\u201d window.</p><p>And while Stage Manager was (and still may be) buggy, I at least have run into a lot fewer problems here on the M2 iPad Pro with the final iPadOS 16.1 release. I\u2019ve been working on this iPad for the entirety of my work day and think I\u2019ve only had one app crash on me (Gmail, which isn\u2019t exactly the best iPad app on its best days). There are some conceptual things about Stage Manager I\u2019m still grappling with, like the best way to add or remove apps from a group, but I think the experience is worth spending a day or two with to see if you can find your flow.</p><figure><img alt=\"Apple iPad Pro (2022) \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/bf495040-59e1-11ed-a74d-0924f57e9b11\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>There\u2019s no question that the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJKTEJLTVY4P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTJsLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxNmQ1ODE1Zi0zZDM5LTQ4MWUtYmZiMC0xMDk1MGJmMGQ1ZjEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaUpWFeSyrqCMXpwuFx49TN6HPTkcNWiWi2d4go6RS3J&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLBKMV8\">new iPad Pro</a> is better than its predecessor.

The T7 Shield is the newest addition to the series and, along with being IP65 water- and dust-resistant, it has a more rugged exterior that helps it survive nearly 10-foot drops.

The drawbacks include slightly excessive fan noise, rainbow effect and red-tinted 3D. <em>\u2014 Steve Dent, Associate Editor</em></p><a class=\"athena-button rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwNzdURzIySDMvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTJpLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmNGI2ZjZkMi02MGQyLTQyYzYtODk2Ni03MzE3MTEzZWI5ZTkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATbbRmMg_etOmqGmCaaKYSeGZjGoircbCfb_tDGIn8D7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB077TG22H3%2F\" id=\"22a98855c3034bceaac920ea149a5f82\">Buy BenQ HT2050A projector at Amazon - $799</a><h2>65-inch LG C2 OLED TV</h2><figure><img alt=\"65-inch LG C2 OLED TV\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/ef23dfe0-5461-11ed-affa-bc6d83cc851b\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p>If you're looking for the best possible TV to buy, there\u2019s no question: Pick an OLED model.

Unlike LCD TVs, which rely on backlights, pixels on OLED TVs can turn themselves on and off individually. That allows them to capture inky blacks and deliver better contrast than most LCD panels. The C2 is only a slight revision of last year\u2019s C1, but that\u2019s mainly a testament to how great the previous model was. It has a 120Hz refresh rate for speedy gaming, as well as support for G-SYNC and Freesync to avoid annoying frame stuttering. Its wide viewing angles also mean everyone can get a perfect picture, no matter where they're sitting. \u2014 <em>Devindra Hardawar, Senior Editor</em></p><a class=\"athena-button rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOVJNUk5TQkYvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTJpLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmNGI2ZjZkMi02MGQyLTQyYzYtODk2Ni03MzE3MTEzZWI5ZTkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZeaup05cpLILf6UPJSmhStRDG52i9htDCER2mX3Q0AY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09RMRNSBF%2F\" id=\"a7ceced00dcf40c981a4f7e1fc8c96bb\">Buy 65-inch LG C2 OLED at Amazon - $1,799</a><h2>Monoprice Monolith THX Atmos home theater speakers</h2><figure><img alt=\"Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/838d08d0-2dc8-11ec-bcf7-bc5ee1842864\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Monoprice </div></figure><p>Sometimes, a soundbar just doesn't cut it.

The booster will break off three minutes into the flight and splash down in the Gulf of Mexico, while the Starship vehicle itself will go into orbit before reentering and making an ocean landing near Hawaii. The company expects the entire test flight to last for 90 minutes.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>SpaceX has been planning Starship's first orbital flight since mid-2021, but it kept getting pushed back due to various technical and regulatory reasons.

And even then, the FAA required the company to make more than 75 changes to mitigate the environmental impact of its flights before it grants the company a launch license for the site.&nbsp;</p><p>An FAA spokesperson told <em>Reuters</em> that the agency will grant the company a launch license \"only after SpaceX provides all outstanding information and the agency can fully analyze it.\" As <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/nasa-predicts-first-starship-orbital-launch-as-soon-as-december/\"><em>SpaceNews</em></a> notes, SpaceX must also conduct and clear more tests before the flight, including a static fire test of all 33 Raptor engines on the Super Heavy booster.&nbsp;</p><p>A static fire test of the Starship in July <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starship-booster-explosion-074522654.html\">ended up in flames</a> when propellants ignited under the booster. SpaceX's next attempt in August <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/space-static-fire-test-starship-super-heavy-booster-092003739.html\">went smoothly</a>, but the company only fired a single Raptor engine on the Super Heavy that time. In addition, Starship must go through a full wet dress rehearsal, wherein a rocket that's loaded with propellants go through the launch countdown without actually taking off.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"d9289c7fc17142c3940b2b1b08e39dd9\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">SpaceX will do a lot of test flights of Starship, including an uncrewed landing on the moon, before landing astronauts there, Kirasich says.

The organization also said that Musk asked the Twitter team to review some of its policies, including its rule regarding misinformation that penalizes posts containing falsehoods about politics and COVID-19. Another rule Musk reportedly asked the team to review is a section in Twitter's hateful conduct policy that penalizes posts containing \"targeted misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals.\"</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-promises-support-call-of-duty-playstation-forever-060216077.html?src=rss", "title": "Microsoft now implies that it will support Call of Duty on PlayStation forever", "date_published": "2022-11-01 06:02:16+00:00", "description": "<p>Earlier this year, Sony PlayStation boss <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-playstation-activision-call-of-duty-offer-081418908.html\">Jim Ryan said</a> that Microsoft's promise to support <em>Call of Duty</em> on PlayStation for three more years was \"inadequate on many levels.\" Now in comments to the gaming podcast <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKy9c3p3rqU&amp;t=1611s\"><em>SameBrain</em></a>, Xbox chief Phil Spencer appears to have extended that timeframe to forever, or at least as long as PlayStation exists as a platform.</p><p>\"We're not taking <em>Call of Duty</em> from PlayStation,\" he said. \"Our intent is not to do that, and as long as there's a PlayStation out there to ship to, our intent is that we'd continue to ship <em>Call of Duty</em> on PlayStation, similar to what we've done with Minecraft since we've owned that.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>\"We've expanded the places where people can play Minecraft, we haven't reduced the places, and it's been good.
