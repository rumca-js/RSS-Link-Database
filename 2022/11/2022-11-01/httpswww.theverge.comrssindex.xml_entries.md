  <p id="TMcUyd">Most people know that buying a refurbished tech product will save you money compared to buying it new. It also gives a device a second life instead of sending it off to be recycled.

If you’re gifting tech for the holidays (and perhaps you want to avoid the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday">Black Friday and Cyber Monday</a> rush), it’s not a bad idea to see what kinds of stuff you can find refurbished across the web.</p>

  <p id="Hxsofx">Amazon is expanding its music offering, opening up its full catalog of 100 million songs in Amazon Music to Prime subscribers at no extra charge. The company is also offering many of its in-house podcasts and a selection of others, ad-free, in the app. You’ll still need a separate subscription if you want Amazon Music to really rival Spotify and Apple Music, but Amazon’s service is becoming a seriously compelling (sort of) free option.</p>
<p id="UkDOvV">The difference in tiers is all about access.
