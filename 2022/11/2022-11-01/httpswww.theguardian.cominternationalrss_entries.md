<p>It was wild, it was intense and it rested on the edge of a knife. Tottenham did that thing they have done too readily of late and failed to show up in the first half. When they trailed at the break to Chancel Mbemba’s header, it was the least that Marseille deserved. The French club were in line for a first qualification to the Champions League knockout phase since 2011-12.</p><p>It had been billed as a psychological test for Spurs; the din inside this caldron was relentless. Now it became something even greater. Starring at elimination, Spurs had to dig deep into the depths of their resolve, to show their personality. During a second half that will live long in the memories of the travelling fans, they did so.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/01/marseille-tottenham-hotspur-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Mohamed Salah equalled Steven Gerrard’s record of 41 European goals for Liverpool as Jürgen Klopp’s team wrapped up their Champions League group campaign with a morale-lifting victory over Napoli. It was the Serie A leaders first defeat in any competition in 18 matches this season and a little slice of revenge for Liverpool’s mauling in Naples at the beginning of a transformed European campaign.</p><p>Salah struck five minutes from time after substitute Darwin Núñez’s header had been saved on the line by Alex Meret. Luciano Spalletti’s side finished top of Group A courtesy of their 4-1 home win over Liverpool but for Klopp, taking charge of the Anfield club for the 400th time, victory number 249 was one to embrace given the doubts and the questions circling over his team’s form this season. Núñez added a second deep into injury time after a VAR review overturned the initial decision to disallow his tap-in for offside.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/01/liverpool-napoli-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Queer families are teaching us there are many ways to be a mother | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett

<p>While heterosexual couples may struggle with traditional gender roles, queer motherhood offers a radical, beautiful alternative</p><p>What does it mean to be a mother? I’ve been thinking about that question since before I became one myself, not only in my own writing but while reading the work of others. I’ve read hundreds of thousands of words on the topic, by writers from a huge range of perspectives and backgrounds, and though it has been hugely rewarding, the question still lingers.</p><p>Not long after giving birth, while battling to feed a premature infant with my body, I picked up a copy of Claire Lynch’s memoir <a href="https://www.foyles.co.uk/witem/biography/small-on-motherhoods,claire-lynch-9781914240010">Small: On Motherhoods</a>. It is, among many other things, a tender, powerful reflection on queer motherhood, and on what it means to be a mother when you are not the partner who gives birth to the baby or breastfeeds them, and how it feels to push against those archetypes. It sheds light on how it feels to be embarking on parenthood as an atypical family: the scenes set in pre-natal classes, where Lynch is grouped with the dads, are wryly funny but make a serious point about gender-divided parenting culture. The part where a colleague says: “Here she comes, the woman who can’t even be bothered to give birth to her own children,” (Lynch had had a miscarriage and eventually they decided that her wife would carry the baby) made me gasp.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/01/queer-families-mother-relationships-gender-roles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Lee Jung-jae’s directorial debut, set in 1980s South Korea, is busy to the point of exhaustion and ends up chasing its own tail</p><p>This whirling, churning, exhaustingly busy – but lavishly produced – Korean action-thriller film is directed by and stars Lee Jung-jae, who played the down-on-his-luck protagonist Seong in Squid Game. Although he’s been a big name for years in South Korea, starting out as a heartthrob in the 1990s, his current fame in the west probably explains why the film was selected for Cannes and other festivals this year. That means it’s available to audiences who probably won’t know the historical context vital to understanding the plot. It’s worth some pre-viewing brushing up on South Korea in 1983, when the film was set – the regime was deeply repressive at the time and the country was riven by internal protests, while tensions with North Korea were (literally) explosive.</p><p>If you keep all that in mind and think of this as a John Le Carré-style story, set in Asia and on speed, it makes a bit more sense. Lee plays Park Pyong-ho, the chief of the foreign unit of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA), who is locked in a power struggle with his counterpart Kim Jung-do (Jung Woo-sung) from the domestic unit of the KCIA – especially after president Chun Doo-hwan is almost assassinated while visiting the United States. It turns out there is a North Korean mole operating within the KCIA, and both Park and Kim are assigned to head competing teams to find out who it is.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/01/hunt-review-squid-game-lee-jung-jae-directs-stunt-filled-spy-flick">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Some very vocal people were outraged by the video for the new single Anti-Hero. But when you’re dealing with eating disorders, sometimes there’s no escaping the f-word</p><p>Want to watch Taylor Swift magically lose fat overnight? No, of course you don’t – you’re not a weirdo. But if you are just a little curious about what I am talking about, then have a look at Swift’s music video for the single Anti-Hero from her new album, Midnights. There is a scene in it in which the musician steps on some scales and looks up sadly as her doppelganger shakes her head in disgust. This visual would be unremarkable were it not for the fact that it was hastily swapped in a week ago, just days after the video’s initial release, to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/27/taylor-swift-edits-anti-hero-music-video-fat-bathroom-scales">replace the controversial original</a>. In the first version, Swift gets on the scales and, instead of numbers, she sees the word FAT pop up. This upset a lot of people who decreed that, by using the word “fat”, Swift was being “fatphobic”. Swift decided not to risk cancellation or prolong the controversy by explaining herself or defending her artistic choices; instead, she just quietly altered the video.</p><p>Perhaps you are confused by all the fuss over the word fat. You don’t need a degree in Swiftian studies to glean that the singer, who has described the video for Anti-Hero as a depiction of her insecurities, was referencing her own body issues, not trying to offend people. While Swift has never explicitly said she has suffered from an eating disorder, she has been open about her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/24/taylor-swift-eating-disorder-miss-americana-documentary-sundance-film-festival-lana-wilson">experiences with disordered eating</a>.

Our experts tell you how …</p><ul><li>Got a culinary dilemma? Email <a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com">feast@theguardian.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>What can I do with leftover parmesan rinds? People always say not to discard them.<br /></strong><em><strong>Leah, London SW1</strong></em><br />Parmesan rinds<strong> </strong>are real imparters of flavour, so you’re right to think twice about tossing them, Leah. “When I was young, my parents used to give me them to chew on when I was losing my baby teeth,” recalls Filippo La Gattuta, executive chef at <a href="https://bigmammagroup.com/es/accueil">Big Mamma Group</a> in London. Of course, he has since found other solutions to the leftover rind predicament. “My favourite way now is to scrape the rind with a knife [just to remove the waxy coating], cut it up into small pieces, then pop in a microwave for a minute or so, until they puff up.” Once cooled, you’ll have the perfect, crunchy snack to accompany aperitivo hour.</p><p>If you don’t have a microwave, however, make cheesy “chips” in the oven. Chef Theo Randall, author of <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-italian-pantry-9781787138421">The Italian Pantry</a>, says, “Soak the rinds in about a litre of boiling water [from the kettle], then, once they’re soft, cut them quite thinly and bake.” The key is to get the rinds nice and soft – “you get a much nicer flavour that way” – so if soaking them doesn’t do the trick, transfer the lot to a pan and heat on the stove. Snack success also hinges on those rinds having been stored correctly: “Keep them somewhere dry,” says Randall, who pops his in a paper bag and keeps them in a plastic container in a cupboard. The Guardian’s Italian food correspondent, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rachel-roddy/">Rachel Roddy</a>, meanwhile, keeps hers in the fridge but, she adds, “you could put them in an airtight container in the freezer”.</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

<p>Set in 1960, Leon Prudovky’s tale of a Polish Holocaust survivor who suspects his imposing new neighbour is the Führer himself veers towards silliness</p><p>Russian-born Israeli film-maker Leonid Prudovsky has confected an unsatisfying tonal oddity: a jokey-sentimental drama with weird slashes of actual historical pain. The year is 1960 and a lonely, cantankerous Polish Holocaust survivor called Polsky (played by David Hayman) is living all on his own in a village in Colombia. Unhappy Polsky has a psychosomatic prostate complaint which makes urinating difficult; he takes what happiness he can in chess and growing a special strain of black roses.</p><p>Polsky is astonished when a high-handed and unpleasantly secretive German expat moves in to the house next door, wearing what appears to be a false beard: a Herr Herzog, played by Udo Kier. This oddly familiar-looking figure has an alsatian which makes a nuisance of itself in Polsky’s garden; he has an easel on which he paints bland daubs, an army of obedient young German men to help with yard work and redecoration and an officious German lawyer, Frau Kaltenbrunner (Olivia Silhavy), who tells Polsky that his new neighbour is in fact entitled to some of Polsky’s land, including that part where his roses are growing. Having surrendered to this petty demand for <em>Lebensraum</em>, Polsky becomes obsessed with the idea that this man is in fact you-know-who … the satanic figure whose body was not recovered after his widely reported suicide in the ruins of Berlin in 1945. (Polsky checks a portrait photo in a history book, which this film has cheekily doctored, just slightly, so that it resembles Kier.) Yet, bizarrely, these two men begin to thaw over their mutual love of chess.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/01/my-neighbour-adolf-review-chess-bonding-tale-wonders-if-hitler-has-moved-in-next-door">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If I make a move when he’s awake, he tells me he’s not interested. Is this the end of our love life?</p><p><strong>My partner and I have been together for </strong><strong>four years and </strong><strong>used to have a good sex life. </strong><strong>He has a </strong><strong>diagnosed</strong><strong> sleep disorder and falls asleep very quickly. While I am still awake and reading in bed, he will sometimes half wake up shortly after falling asleep and</strong><strong> try initiating sex. I always fully wake him</strong><strong>, ask if he actually wants to have sex and then we either do or don’t, which is fine.</strong><strong> But for the </strong><strong>past 10 months</strong><strong> these encounters are the </strong><em><strong>only</strong></em><strong> time my partner seems interested in sex</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>When I try to initiate, he says he</strong><strong> is not interested</strong><strong>.

<p>Film-maker Eliane Henri set out to chronicle the day-to-day life of revered jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove – but didn’t know she would also be documenting his untimely death</p><p>From the start of their 28-year friendship, Eliane Henri knew trumpeter Roy Hargrove was a genius. “I was 17 when I went to see his first show in LA and it was like nothing I’d experienced before,” Henri says. “Jazz was this old music to me and listening to it used to be like eating your vegetables, but here was this 20-year-old guy with a totally fresh, fully formed sound already. It was like having Miles Davis walk among us.”</p><p>In the years since that debut show in the early 90s, Hargrove’s star ascended. Winning two Grammys in 1998 and 2002 – the latter with Davis collaborator Herbie Hancock – Hargrove went on to apply his hard-swinging sound and ear for intricate arrangements to the spectrum of Black American music. He was a founding member of the experimental music group the Soulquarians, alongside drummer Questlove, singer D’Angelo and rapper Common, while his RH Factor group interweaved R&amp;B, funk and hip-hop with jazz improvisation, earning a Grammy nomination in 2004. His 2008 album Earfood displays the perfect synthesis of his sound, playing as a mix of big-band swing and funk swagger across its 14 tracks and ultimately producing a much-covered, modern jazz standard in the track Strasbourg/St Denis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/01/we-captured-lightning-documenting-jazz-hero-roy-hargrove">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ministers have deliberately neglected those seeking sanctuary, hoping it will deter them.

<p>A ripe crew of wrong’uns hole up in a bar to pick over a raid gone awry, but does deliver one welcome departure from cliche</p><p>You might find it reassuring that, even as the pound yo-yos and democracy unravels, there will forever be a corner of the British film industry that is grim-faced geezers in boozers toting shotguns and plotting shenanigans. This very late entry in a cycle initiated during the Blair administration attempts something a little more characterful than usual, as signalled by the presence of the great Perry Benson in the prologue as a bar owner who corks it before giving up his life insurance details to his son.</p><p>The Last Heist then involves an hour of perilously muggy business, as the lad (co-writer Michael Head, sporting a marked resemblance to the young Frank Harper) recalls his old gang to Perry’s bar to work out where their raid on the recalcitrant insurers went bloodily awry. It’s a bit Reservoir Bodge: there’s much gruff talk of codes, and a liberal scattering of the other C-word, before the film pulls a loopy twist from an otherwise threadbare sleeve.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/01/the-last-heist-review-grim-faced-brit-gangster-thriller-is-reservoir-bodge">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the world faces the worst debt crisis in decades, the need for a global lender of last resort is clearer than ever. But many nations view the IMF as overbearing, or even neocolonial – and are now looking elsewhere for help</p><p>Last summer, after months of unusually heavy monsoon rains, and temperatures that approached the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/opinion/india-heat-wave-pakistan-climate-change.html" title="">limits of human survivability</a>, Pakistan – home to thousands of melting Himalayan glaciers – experienced some of the worst floods in its history. The most extensive destruction was in the provinces of Sindh and Balochistan, but some <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pakistan-floods-un-appeal-aid-monsoon-climate-change-rcna45219" title="">estimated</a> that up to a third of the country was submerged. The floods killed more than 1,700 people and displaced a further <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02879-2" title="">32 million</a> – more than the entire population of Australia. Some of the country’s most fertile agricultural areas became giant lakes, drowning livestock and destroying crops and infrastructure. The cost of the disaster now runs to tens of billions of dollars.</p><p>In late August, as the scale of this catastrophe was becoming clear, the Pakistani government was trying to avert a second disaster. It was finally reaching a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to avoid missing payment on its foreign debt. Without this agreement, Pakistan would likely have been declared in default – an event that can spark a recession, weaken a country’s long-term growth, and make it more difficult to borrow at affordable rates in the future. The terms of the deal were painful: the government was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-29/pakistan-says-imf-approves-bailout-to-avert-near-term-default" title="">offered a $1.17bn</a> IMF bailout only after it demonstrated a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d3d57c66-35a8-4815-82e7-20057638129d" title="">real commitment</a> to undertaking unpopular austerity policies, such as slashing energy subsidies. But the recent fate of another south Asian country appeared to show what happens if you put off the IMF for too long. Only weeks before, the Sri Lankan government, shortly after its own default – and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/sri-lanka-says-it-wont-rush-imf-despite-rising-economic-risks-2022-02-11/" title="">after months</a> of refusing to implement IMF-demanded reforms – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/09/sri-lanka-protests-thousands-storm-presidents-residence-colombo" title="">was overthrown</a> in a popular uprising.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/01/is-the-imf-fit-for-purpose">Continue reading...</a>

When she returned on Monday morning, she was stunned to find the widespread damage to her family home. “I couldn’t understand why, what for,” she said. “Why did they do this? We were just peacefully living our lives. Why did this happen?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/01/hanging-washing-over-the-rubble-life-in-mykolaiv-as-russian-bombs-rain-down">Continue reading...</a>
