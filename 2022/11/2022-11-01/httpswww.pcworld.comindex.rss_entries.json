That&rsquo;s why the PCWorld crew invited <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://notthatwillsmith.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1367226-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Will Smith</a>, prolific podcaster and game streamer and a former coworker of Gordon, on the PCWorld YouTube channel. Will needs a new gaming PC and Gordon and Adam are more than happy to lend their expertise to his build. He&rsquo;s ready to put together a new super-powered desktop and send his current gaming machine to secondary streaming duties. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will&rsquo;s a true power user. In addition to high-end game streaming, he does video and audio editing, photo retouches, the works. He&rsquo;s also using a 360Hz 1080p monitor for primary gaming <em>plus </em>a secondary 4K display, so he needs frame-pushing power plus enough video memory to run lots of desktop on the side. In short, his PC needs lots of everything: processor power, GPU, memory, fast storage, all running as quickly and efficiently as possible. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure><p>But there&rsquo;s another aspect to Will&rsquo;s business and that&rsquo;s recording podcasts. So when it&rsquo;s not pushing pixels and rendering frames, the PC needs to stay reasonably quiet. Oh and a case that looks cool with plenty of RGB lighting would be nice, too. A motherboard with integrated Wi-Fi would help with his infrequent travel schedule. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will doesn&rsquo;t need to upgrade his monitors and he has already settled on a pricey <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RTX 4090 graphics card</a>, literally the latest and greatest. For the CPU, Gordon recommends high clocks to hit those massive 300+ framerates. The top-of-the-line AMD and Intel processors are obvious picks (<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357979/intel-core-i9-13900k-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Core i9-13900K</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1074246/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ryzen 9 7950X</a>), with a &ldquo;dark horse&rdquo; being the more affordable <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/701130/tested-the-ryzen-7-5800x3ds-astonishing-performance-shows-how-far-amds-ryzen-has-come.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ryzen 7 5800X3D</a>. But there&rsquo;s a downside with that more economical option &mdash; it uses DDR4 memory, which limits upgrade potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How would you build this monster PC? Watch the video, take Will&rsquo;s needs into account and wait for Adam and Gordon to present their builds. We&rsquo;ll see who comes up with the better machine in an upcoming video &mdash; be sure to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/c/pcworld&amp;xcust=2-1-1367226-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe to PCWorld&rsquo;s YouTube channel</a> for the live build video! </p>\nGaming PCs</div>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/695190/best-free-vpn-for-android.html", "title": "The best free VPN for Android", "date_published": "2022-11-01 16:00:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section><p>Free VPNs aren&rsquo;t just for PCs.

So which ones are worth your time? Our experts have tested a slew of VPNs, both for PCs and Android devices, and have put together a list of the best free options you can feel confident in using. Check out our top picks below.

Still, the speeds are just fine, but what you won&rsquo;t find here are any servers supporting Netflix streaming.

Speedify&rsquo;s specialty is a seamless VPN transition between Wi-Fi and cellular. Typically, when you go between Wi-Fi and cellular the connection drops and restarts, but with Speedify it just keeps on going, which is nice. It also harnesses your Wi-Fi and cellular together to try and boost connection speeds. </p>\n\n<p>Speeds are pretty good with Speedify staying within the top 15 for speeds overall. The downside of this free offering is that you only get 2GB of data usage per month. That&rsquo;s not much, which is why this is our last suggestion. But if you need something simple for basic web browsing Speedify is well worth a look.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393172/speedify-10-vpn-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Speedify 10 review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-to-look-for-in-a-free-vpn-for-android\">What to look for in a free VPN for Android</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This will follow a lot of the advice we&rsquo;ve already given for free stuff when it comes to Android. Google is doing a better job than ever at keeping harmful apps out of the Play Store, but there is still a chance of some random VPN app having malicious intent. Another problem is that even if the app is fine, the service itself may be up to no good. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those reasons we always advise going with a well-known VPN service provider to reduce your chances of running into security issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you want a free app that is truly free. Not some 7- or 30-day trial that will automatically start charging the card connected to your Play account after the trial period. You should also read over the privacy policy to make sure there&rsquo;s nothing there you&rsquo;re going to have a problem with. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you want to make sure the VPN has data limits that suit your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-we-tested\">How we tested</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speeds were based on our tests for Windows using an Ethernet connection. Clearly, on an Android device relying on Wi-Fi the speeds will be very different. Still, they give us an idea of how much slower the connection will be once the VPN is active. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also checked out the VPN&rsquo;s privacy policy to make sure there&rsquo;s nothing objectionable there, and we took a look at the interface to see if it&rsquo;s easy enough to understand how to use it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need a VPN for your Android phone or tablet these four services should be at the top of your list for consideration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you&rsquo;re interested in using a VPN with more than just your Android devices, take a peak at some of our other best VPN roundups to see what&rsquo;s available:</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/634025/best-free-vpns-for-windows.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best free VPN for Windows</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/629037/the-best-free-vpn.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best free VPN</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/622728/best-vpn-for-gaming.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best VPN for gaming</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/618517/the-best-vpn-for-streaming-netflix.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best VPN for streaming Netflix</a></li></ul><div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-block faq-block\"><h2 class=\"faq-block-title\" id=\"faq\"> FAQ </h2><hr class=\"block-horizotal-divider\" /><div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">1.</span>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-vpn\">What is a VPN?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>A VPN, or <em>virtual private network</em>, hides your identity and encrypts your traffic while browsing the internet. Also, VPN servers are located all across the world, allowing you to connect to a server in another country. So if you want to access location-restricted content like streaming services, you can connect to the appropriate country&rsquo;s server and gain access to content that may have been locked in your area. </p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">2.</span>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-a-vpn-work\">How does a VPN work?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>In short, a VPN hides your IP address by redirecting your web traffic through a remote server hosted by the VPN company. The VPN server then appears to be the source of your traffic instead of your actual location. These remote servers can be located both in different countries around the world or even in your own country. Additionally, your network traffic is encrypted from your computer to the VPN, which adds an extra layer of security.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While connected to a VPN and browsing the internet, the VPN acts as a middleman between you and a website. If your computer sends a request to the VPN, it will then pass it along to a website. In return, the website sends its response back to the VPN, which forwards it via a secure encrypted connection to your computer.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">3.</span>\n<h3 id=\"is-it-legal-to-use-a-vpn\">Is it legal to use a VPN?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>In the United States as well as most countries, using a VPN is perfectly legal. Some certain websites try to block VPN connections, but that is dependent upon their own terms of usage. It is important to know that while using a VPN is legal, some of the activities done <em>while using</em> a VPN can still be illegal. Activities such as downloading pirated copyrighted content or accessing dark web markets are both illegal with and without a VPN.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\nVPN</div>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1359589/why-i-quit-overwatch-2-breakup-letter.html", "title": "I loved Overwatch, but now I\u2019m done", "date_published": "2022-11-01 15:51:22+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section><p>It&rsquo;s possible to love a video game. To be devoted to it, to value what it does for you, and how it makes you feel. To want the best for it. Not in the same way you love a person &mdash; or at least, I hope not. But take a look at any major fan convention for video games, movies, TV, or almost anything that develops a subculture, and you can see this love is real, active, and powerful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, profitable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if it&rsquo;s possible to love a video game, then of course it&rsquo;s possible to fall out of love.

Especially if what it needs is regular digital purchases in order to get a competitive advantage in gameplay. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I loved <em>Overwatch </em>once. I don&rsquo;t anymore. How that happened is, I think, worth examining. This Dear John letter is a broad history of the game <em>Overwatch </em>itself, and its relationship with both its own players and the company that made it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-honeymoon-phase\">The honeymoon phase&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, <em>Overwatch </em>was a big deal. A <em>Team Fortress 2</em>-style team shooter, made by the people who brought us <em>Starcraft </em>and <em>Diablo</em>, with incredible character designs that looked like Pixar had decided to reboot <em>G.I. Joe</em>? <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/436265/blizzard-announces-a-brand-new-shooter-overwatch-and-shows-off-starcraft-expansion-at-blizzcon.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Players couldn&rsquo;t get enough of it</a>. And indeed, for the first couple of years <em>Overwatch </em>was a 600-pound Winston of the gaming landscape, dominating game coverage, showing up constantly on Let&rsquo;s Plays, and causing an excited titter with each newly-announced character and map.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward six years, and the launch of <em><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Overwatch 2</a></em> seems to have come and gone with barely a ripple. Between a contentious shift to free-to-play, serious launch problems, and a cloud of problematic exhaustion hovering over Activision Blizzard itself, the shine has come off of the orange stretchy yoga pants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Custom Overwatch keycaps\" class=\"wp-image-1359599\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DSC09561.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>In 2017 I made this custom Overwatch keycap set, using WASDKeyboards&rsquo; art tool, Adobe Illustrator, and a blatant disregard for intellectual property.&nbsp;</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being obsessed with the original game for years, slurping up every bit of lore, buying every licensed LEGO set, attending a live Overwatch League esports event, and even designing my own Overwatch keyboard, I haven&rsquo;t been able to bring myself to even enter a single game of<em> Overwatch 2</em>. I can&rsquo;t force myself to care about it, even for free. There are just too many issues, both internal and external, that make my brain actively reject the new title. I can&rsquo;t help but stare at the little brick D.Va mech on my desk, and think about all the things that have gone wrong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-roster-full-of-missed-opportunities\">A roster full of missed opportunities&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Without a doubt, <em>Overwatch&rsquo;s </em>greatest strength has always been its character design. Each fighter is vibrant, distinct, and interesting. You just want to inspect every little detail, like the best action figures. (In fact, these characters do make pretty great action figures.) And despite being as widely varied as a cyborg ninja, a ballerina sniper, a robot centaur, and a hamster in a 6-foot mecha ball, the art design is so skillfully executed that all of them feel part of the same day-after-tomorrow cartoon future.&nbsp;And it certainly doesn&rsquo;t hurt that there&rsquo;s a bit of PG-13 sexiness to almost all of them, even the grizzled old veterans. Blizzard knows how the bread gets buttered. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Overwatch full roster\" class=\"wp-image-1359598\" height=\"289\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/overwatch-roster.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Blizzard</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But the designs themselves are only part of the appeal. With absolutely incredible animation (again, shades of Pixar) and skillful voice acting, the characters seem like they could walk out of a 6-on-6 deathmatch and into an anime. They kind of do: while prerendered cinematics don&rsquo;t get the same gee-wow reactions they did back in the days of the original <em>Warcraft </em>and <em>Starcraft</em>, the short vignettes created to flesh out the characters and the world of <em>Overwatch </em>remain some of the best parts of the property.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And herein lies the problem. <em>Overwatch </em>has this wonderful cast of characters, brought to life with loving animation and voice acting, and you even get to inhabit them in gameplay. But when you try to dig deeper into the story surrounding the characters, you find yourself shoveling water out of a shallow puddle. Despite most of these characters having a deep backstory with the vaguely <em>Avengers</em>-esque <em>Overwatch </em>organization, the game&rsquo;s story starts &mdash; and effectively ends &mdash; with Winston &ldquo;reactivating&rdquo; the team after years of downtime in the original intro video.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What happens next? Ostensibly, the gameplay of <em>Overwatch 1</em>&hellip;which never actually progresses the story. It&rsquo;s so vague and ill-defined that you can play on a team filled with Overwatch &ldquo;good guys,&rdquo; Talon &ldquo;bad guys,&rdquo; and the various in-between mercenary types, and it makes sense. Because there&rsquo;s no sense at all. You don&rsquo;t necessarily need it for a session of team shooting, but for those of us who&rsquo;ve been craving actual progression and depth for these characters, it feels like we&rsquo;re all Tantalus trying to get a sip.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every gorgeous cinematic is essentially prologue, much of which we already knew. Even the few seasonal event missions, repeated every year since launch ad nauseam, have to take place before the &ldquo;reactivation&rdquo; start of the story, because otherwise they don&rsquo;t make sense with the paper-thin narrative of the gameplay. Every one of the dozens of comics and short stories Blizzard has given us is adding to a huge mountain of prelude, every new character has to have something they were doing before Winston presses that pivotal &mdash; and ultimately meaningless &mdash; button.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure><p><em>Overwatch </em>was sold as an ever-expanding roster of fantastic characters. And it is, or at least it was, until work unceremoniously paused for the developers to create a pseudo-sequel. But even fighting games and MOBAs, whose characters barely ever go deeper than &ldquo;person who fights other people,&rdquo; have stories that progress and resolve to a certain degree. <em>Overwatch </em>doesn&rsquo;t, and never has. As a fan who genuinely loves a lot of these characters, watching them remain frozen in time even as the game ostensibly progresses is something I find incredibly frustrating.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"gameplay-is-a-moving-target\">Gameplay is a moving target&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Overwatch</em>&rsquo;s gameplay struggled with a bit of an identity crisis at launch. Broadly similar to <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, it encouraged fast-paced coordination with a team, with a secondary feature of constantly switching between its many heroes to counter the choices of the other side. But while <em>TF2</em> could have huge teams and dozens of active players in its broad offense, defense, and support roles, the more varied, specialized cast in <em>Overwatch </em>had shades of MOBAs like <em>League of Legends</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the multiplayer matches never ceased to be fun, issues cropped up almost immediately. The combo of shields and turrets proved to be extremely difficult to crack without precision teamwork, especially when combined with the self-propelling cart objective. Some characters like Hanzo and Symmetra had abilities that were overpowered, making them nearly unstoppable in specific situations, while traditional shooter roles like Widowmaker&rsquo;s sniper or Tracer&rsquo;s scout were all but useless without a high-skill player behind them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Overwatch hamster wrecking ball\" class=\"wp-image-1359622\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/wrecking-ball-screenshot-003.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Blizzard</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, you had the usual problem of people missing the point of a team-based shooter: the team is more important than the shooting. Even in competitive modes, players would flock to the more viscerally fun offensive-based characters, collecting kills while tanks and supports collected dust. Again, the minute-to-minute gameplay was always fast and enjoyable, but anyone focused on actually winning games (and at least willing to try the role-based teamwork) quickly grew frustrated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blizzard&rsquo;s answer was to continually tweak both the characters and the game&rsquo;s very structure. In addition to the usual small adjustments for the sake of balance and flow, characters would receive effective redesigns from the ground up to try and address overwhelming advantages. Notable examples include axing Mercy&rsquo;s full-team revival power, tweaking turret specialists Torbjorn and Bastion to force them into more mobile roles, toning down overpowered abilities from Hanzo and Roadhog, and completely redesigning Symmetra&rsquo;s specialized power set not once, but twice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Symmetra Overwatch 2 \" class=\"wp-image-1359596\" height=\"673\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/symmetra-overwatch-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Blizzard completely redesigned the skills of heroes like Symmetra, often multiple times.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Blizzard</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of the constant character tweaks that players had to adjust to, Blizzard would radically change the game&rsquo;s setup on more than one occasion. While initially players could load up multiple copies of each character on both teams, the game switched to selections that <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://dotesports.com/general/news/kaplan-overwatch-hero-limit-season-2-3703&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">blocked out a character after another player had chosen them</a>. This spelled the end of fun if tactically unsound compositions, like a team full of giant hammer-swinging Reinhardt knights and one zippy little Lucio to boost their speed and heal them up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a bigger change was re-arranging the division of characters from offense/defense/tank/support to just three divisions, damage/tank/healer. Because there was a roughly even split before, and because some characters were pretty borderline anyway, this suddenly meant that there were more than double the number of damage characters as either tank or healer&hellip;despite an ostensibly &ldquo;even&rdquo; split in the importance of those three roles.&nbsp;Initially the only real difference was fodder for team comp squabbles (&ldquo;can we PLEASE get some healers?&rdquo; asks the guy who refuses to switch off Genji), technical discussions about the meta, and lots and lots of forum battles. But as newer characters were introduced and the roster of damage choices continued to outpace tanks and supports, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://kotaku.com/overwatchs-latest-update-redeems-the-games-competitive-1837276905&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Blizzard created Role Queue</a>. This would turn out to be the least popular and most problematic choice in the game&rsquo;s brief history.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Overwatch Role Queue\" class=\"wp-image-1359597\" height=\"663\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Q8Z1QOXZG8QP1563419447038.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Blizzard</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Forcing teams to have only one &ldquo;copy&rdquo; of each hero restricted player choices somewhat, but the large roster made up for it. But role queue forced players to choose damage, tank, or healer right from the start of their play session, with no way to switch out of that choice without ending (or just quitting) the current match. Predictably, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/elhnqg/role_queue_killed_overwatch/&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ever-longer digital lines</a> formed up behind the &ldquo;damage&rdquo; queue, which contained the most fun and popular characters even before two categories were smooshed into one gigantic one. With a big, frustrating barrier between players and the main content of the game, <em>Overwatch </em>suddenly became an exercise in patience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While all of this was going on, Blizzard seemed more concerned with a part of the game that, well, wasn&rsquo;t actually a part of the game. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://gamerant.com/nfl-owners-sponsoring-overwatch-league/&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Overwatch League</a> was meant to be a bold new direction in esports, adapting city-based teams and fandoms into a system that had previously been more akin to following individual golfers or boxers climb up the ranks. Initially met with a lot of optimism among <em>Overwatch </em>fans, if not esports as a whole, Blizzard sank billions into establishing the league and getting investors for the dozens of city-based teams.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Overwatch League stage\" class=\"wp-image-1359592\" height=\"599\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/overwatch-league.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"996\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Activision Blizzard</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But as it turns out, you can&rsquo;t make a game that appeals equally to the kind of .01 percent of gamers who can compete internationally, and the kind of gamers who can enjoy <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://nintendeal.com/review/overwatch-legendary-edition-review-30-fps-and-i-just-dont-care/&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">playing a fast-paced shooter on the Nintendo Switch</a>. Blizzard&rsquo;s gameplay tweaks and balance adjustments quickly seemed to pivot towards making OWL matches closer and more exciting, instead of trying to keep the various playable heroes on even footing for the casual and competitive modes of <em>Overwatch </em>itself. (You know, the thing millions of players were actively engaging in the product, instead of watching it on a Twitch stream.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between long wait times to play in role queue, tweaks that seemed to be made for the benefit of everyone except the game&rsquo;s player base, and content updates that became more and more anemic, <em>Overwatch </em>gradually lost grip of the public&rsquo;s attention and never got it back. The <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/398308/blizzcon-2019-blizzard-announces-diablo-iv-overwatch-2-world-of-warcraft-shadowlands.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announcement of <em>Overwatch 2</em></a>, and the subsequent and indefinite wait for it to actually release, essentially spelled the end of the original game.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"broken-pve-promises\">Broken PvE promises</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Which isn&rsquo;t to say that it was the death of <em>Overwatch </em>as a brand. Blizzard did a poor job of explaining exactly what <em>Overwatch 2</em> is, aside from the fact that it isn&rsquo;t a sequel in the conventional sense. But one of the most exciting features was to be an expanded focus on player-versus-environment modes, indulging players like me who wanted more story and weren&rsquo;t necessarily invested in the constant competition of the opposing shooter modes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Overwatch 2 PvE skill tree\" class=\"wp-image-1359594\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/overwatch-pve.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The skill tree from Overwatch 2&rsquo;s PvE mode&hellip;which you won&rsquo;t see until 2023. At least.&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Blizzard</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After a few years of short and repetitive PvE missions, which as I previously said were wholly uninterested in actually progressing the story or the characters beyond the big button press, I was stoked. The initial Blizzcon 2019 presentation seemed to indicate that we&rsquo;d be getting a series of grander and much more interesting single-player missions, focusing on dynamic team compositions, set-piece battles, and upgrading and expanding individual powers as they progressed, MOBA-style.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would be a huge improvement on the first game, which offered a grand total of four missions in which you could team up to tell an actual story. (One of which, Junkenstein&rsquo;s Revenge, was an entertaining but non-canon dress-up session.) The first cinematic for <em>Overwatch 2 </em>even drove this point home: the team is finally assembled and ready for action, ostensibly getting off the giant pause button the story had been suck on since 2016.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure><p>And yet, when Blizzard announced it was finally ready for beta testers, what it would be testing was&hellip;the standard multiplayer mode. Sure, there are tweaks: another character power reboot for Orisa, newcomer Sojourn (another offense hero, natch), and teams are now limited to five players on a side instead of six. But that highly-touted PvE content, as it turns out, will have to wait until 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let that sink in for a moment. This game, which started with what looked like an interesting setup to tell stories in a brand new Blizzard world, has to wait <em>seven years</em> after its initial launch date to get any kind of forward progression for those stories. And that&rsquo;s assuming that Blizzard actually fulfills its promise and doesn&rsquo;t give us a series of insubstantial mini-missions, as was the case with the original game.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I played through the beta, and made a few observations with friends about how it had shifted slightly. Quicker gameplay, less focus on shields with only one tank per side, an easier time breaking through choke points. But it felt like a refinement of the original game, not a true sequel or even a re-launch. Any enthusiasm I had for engaging in this universe in which I had invested so much time was, once again, put on pause.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"and-everything-else\">&hellip;and everything else&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The final death knell for my interest in <em>Overwatch 2 </em>came when it was announced that it would switch to a free-to-play setup with a battle pass system, in which players would need to either pay or grind to unlock new characters. (Those who hadn&rsquo;t bought the first game, which would disappear once <em>Overwatch 2 </em>launched, would even have to grind to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/09/28/overwatch-2-it-will-take-new-players-about-100-matches-to-unlock-all-original-heroes&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">unlock some of the <em>original cast</em></a>.) With every game from <em>Fortnite </em>to <em>Rocket League</em> to <em>Clash of Clans</em> trying to sell me a battle pass, and then trying to get me to grind it out multiple times every year, I&rsquo;d had enough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Overwatch 2 battle pass\" class=\"wp-image-1359595\" height=\"517\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/overwatch-2-battle-pass.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To play devil&rsquo;s advocate, <em>Overwatch </em>really should have been a free-to-play game from the start. Activision Blizzard has <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/revenue&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">made more money slinging the randomized loot boxes</a>, primed with limited events and artificial scarcity to such a degree that they&rsquo;ve been <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/loot-box-laws-block-diablo-immortal-launch-in-some-european-countries/&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">banned as de facto gambling in some countries</a>, than it ever did in sales of the actual game.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But battle passes have quickly become an even more greedy alternative, particularly where Activision Blizzard is concerned. True, they don&rsquo;t require spinning a roulette wheel to unlock their ingrained prizes. But they&rsquo;ve now become a way of splitting the player base into the haves and have-nots, in which those who pay up have specific advantages in gameplay. That&rsquo;s not always the case &mdash; <em>Fortnite</em> remains refreshingly dedicated to cosmetic-only upgrades, for example.&nbsp;But it&rsquo;s certainly true in <em>Overwatch</em>, where half of the strategy is supposed to be switching your character on the fly to counter the choices of the other team and complement your own. And Activision Blizzard had recently <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/hearthstone-is-introducing-premium-currency-and-a-battlegrounds-season-pass-players-are-unimpressed/&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">pulled the same distasteful move in <em>Hearthstone</em></a>, where players of the popular Battlegrounds mode now have to pay real money to get the best chance of pulling the hero they actually want to use.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Hearthstone battlepass\" class=\"wp-image-1359619\" height=\"889\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hearthstone-Screenshot-10-23-22-16.47.31.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Overwatch isn&rsquo;t the only Blizzard game trying to suck more money out of you: Hearthstone now charges for hero choices in Battlegrounds.&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Blizzard</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After years of grinding for lootboxes and somehow still missing out on some of the best skins in the game, <em>Overwatch </em>players are no strangers to dealing with Activision Blizzard&rsquo;s greed. The manipulative battle pass system was the straw that broke the hover-payload for me. I had been growing increasingly frustrated with the company due to its behind-the-scenes problems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you follow game industry news, you know what I&rsquo;m talking about. An apparent willingness to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitzchung_controversy#:~:text=Banning%20of%20Ng%20Wai%20Chung,-On%20October%206&amp;text=The%20company%20cited%20a%20rule,still%20bound%20by%20competition%20rules.&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">engage in China&rsquo;s oppressive cultural mandates</a>.

Without turning this article into a laundry list of complaints against Activision Blizzard, it seems to be a deeply troubled company that doesn&rsquo;t treat its employees with even basic dignity. Its responses to these controversies have been the usual corporate dross, and have done almost nothing to indicate that it&rsquo;s interested in actual change.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/605846/microsoft-hopes-to-buy-activision-blizzard-in-a-deal-that-would-make-gaming-history.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard at the start of this year,</a> part of its ongoing efforts to create a stable of first-party developers and publishers to compete with Sony and Nintendo. Though the tech giant has given a few terse statements on the ongoing situation with its latest acquisition, there&rsquo;s no indication that it will get rid of Kotick, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://kotaku.com/over-1200-activision-blizzard-employees-sign-petition-d-1848086536&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">a specific request of thousands of employees</a>. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like Microsoft cares whether Activision Blizzard continues to slide towards anti-consumer monetization strategies, either.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"no-big-loss\">No big loss&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So with all of that running through my mind, I felt weirdly relieved trying to get into a game of <em>Overwatch 2 </em>on launch day, and being met with a queue of 40,000 people that never seemed to get any shorter. The situation stayed the same for three days, and each time the game stubbornly refused to load, I almost felt happy to go do something else.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzard-and-overwatch-2-struck-by-third-ddos-attack-in-a-week&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Blizzard said it was a DDOS attack.</a> I say it was a blessing, an excuse to close the launcher and find another game to fill my time. It&rsquo;s possible to actually get into matches now, despite an ongoing host of issues &mdash; perhaps not surprising from a company that seems to be actively battling its own QA department. But my experience with<em> Overwatch 2</em> is still limited to about an hour of the beta.&nbsp;                                      </p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Overwatch 1 cost $40 for the whole game.

Each of these cosmetics is $15-20. </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Blizzard</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Overwatch </em>isn&rsquo;t the same game it was in 2016. That&rsquo;s no indictment: a multiplayer game actively courting an audience of millions should change, especially if it sells itself on remaining new and interesting. But for every improvement the <em>Overwatch </em>developers have made, it seems like they&rsquo;ve also taken a step back, especially in terms of avaricious monetization. And Blizzard certainly isn&rsquo;t the same developer it was in 2016&hellip;or at least, it isn&rsquo;t the developer we <em>thought </em>it was, unburdened by a host of illuminating peeks behind the curtain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll re-engage with this once-wonderful property when it launches some story content next year, and becomes more than &ldquo;<em>Overwatch 1.5</em>.&rdquo; Maybe some time apart will be good for both of us. Or maybe I&rsquo;ll skim the gaming news headlines and see if Activision Blizzard has decided to treat its employees better, perhaps under the stern gaze of its new owner and the guiding hand of absolutely anyone except Bobby Kotick.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Overwatch cast\" class=\"wp-image-1359623\" height=\"502\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/overwatch-cast.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Blizzard</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Or maybe I&rsquo;ll forget all about it between now and then.

The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless also has the finest software support I&rsquo;ve seen for a gaming headset, allowing you to choose from among 23 pre-made EQ presets designed for games like <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>, <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Dota 2</em>, <em>Forza Horizon V, </em>and <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, to name just a few. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/705178/steelseries-arctis-nova-pro-wireless-headphones-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"2-hyperx-cloud-alpha-best-wired-gaming-headset\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.

We analyze everything from how comfortable and durable they are, to how they perform in games and the software support they get via their manufacturer&rsquo;s apps. Here&rsquo;s a list of the main categories we look at:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"design-and-comfort\">Design and comfort</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll spend an awful lot of time wearing a gaming headset, so it&rsquo;s vital that it feels comfortable. Here we look at design features that either add or subtract from your overall comfort experience&mdash;features like a headset&rsquo;s shape and weight, how well it fits on your head, and the amount of padding in the earcups. But design also plays a big role in a headset&rsquo;s functionality, so we also look at how adjustable the band is, and how accessible the controls are.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"audio-quality\">Audio quality</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s no point owning a headset with comfortable leatherette earcups if it can&rsquo;t muster a decent sound. That said, PCWorld reviewers do a lot of listening to get an overall impression of a headset&rsquo;s audio quality. We take notes on the clarity of the sound, how well the headset produces pitch, and in the case of wireless headsets, how much signal interference there is. Our listening is guided by what we know about the headset&rsquo;s hardware or software. For example, if a headset has Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), we&rsquo;ll investigate how well the headset can isolate sound and block out noise. We also test the microphone, listening for muffled sounds, static, robotic noises, and any echoes&mdash;all signs there could be a problem.    </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"software-support\">Software support</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With audio technologies getting ever more complex, gamers have more tools at their disposal than ever via headset apps. Technologies like Hi-Res audio, Spatial Surround Sound, and Parametric EQ all spring to mind, which is why we look closely at the kind of software support on offer.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-choose-a-gaming-headset\">How to choose a gaming headset</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"connectivity-wired-versus-wireless-or-both\">Connectivity: Wired versus wireless, or both?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, gamers have mostly chosen wired headsets over wireless ones. That&rsquo;s because, until recently, wired headsets were considered much better at delivering fast and secure audio signals than wireless headsets. Nowadays, thanks to the adoption of faster 2.4GHz Wi-Fi band technology, wireless headsets can also transmit audio signals very quickly and with minimal interference.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consequently, if you&rsquo;re a casual gamer and not too fussy about the very miniscule risk of your audio dropping out, a wireless headset should be completely fine for your gaming needs, the main advantage being you&rsquo;ll get tons of extra mobility while still being able to listen to your game&rsquo;s audio&mdash;something you don&rsquo;t get when you&rsquo;re tethered by wires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly though, if you&rsquo;re a serious gamer or esports player, you may still want to avoid that small chance your wireless signal will suffer some degree of loss or interference&mdash;even if that&rsquo;s less likely than ever. If the stakes are high, a wired set will provide a little more surety that you won&rsquo;t miss any crucial game moments, which could make all the difference in a closely contested match. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can&rsquo;t decide, there are headsets now like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/705178/steelseries-arctis-nova-pro-wireless-headphones-review.html\">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless</a> that provide both wireless and wired functionality in one easy unit and can switch between these modes in less than a minute. These headsets can cost significantly more, so be willing to pay for the privilege.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"device-compatibility-what-ports-will-i-need\">Device compatibility: What ports will I need?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing to consider is which devices you might want to connect to, since wired and wireless headsets have different compatibilities. For example, most wired headsets connect to your computer via a USB-C connection, but unlike many wireless units, some also have 3.5 mm audio jacks, so they tend to be compatible with a broader number of devices&mdash;like smartphones, gaming consoles, and tablets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wireless devices on the other hand, connect to your device via a USB-C dongle or Bluetooth connection, which does narrow the number of devices you can use them with to either those that are Bluetooth compatible, or that come with USB-C ports.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"comfort-why-its-a-non-negotiable\">Comfort: Why it&rsquo;s a non-negotiable</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can possibly do without fancy styling, you should never buy a headset that&rsquo;s going to cause you discomfort. That&rsquo;s because even a small amount of force or abrasion from wearing your headset can be extremely unpleasant and result in neck pain, rash, cranial pressure or worse. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A huge consideration here is how your headset fits on your head and ears. Granted, you won&rsquo;t always have the opportunity to try them on, it pays to look closely at PCWorld product reviews where our reviewers have done the wearing for you and have summarized how they feel, even after extended periods of time with them on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also pay close attention to product descriptions for the features that indicate that a manufacturer has made comfort a priority. Things you&rsquo;ll want to tick off your check list are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The headset has a flexible band to minimize pressure and that the band is height adjustable to fit your ears.   </li><li>There is sufficient padding on the earcups and the material is hypoallergenic so it won&rsquo;t cause skin irritation. </li><li>The earcups are easily rotatable&mdash;since this will ensure they move with your head as it moves. </li></ul><p>If possible, you should avoid headsets that are excessively heavy, or tightly fitting, since the added weight and clamp force will undoubtedly cause problems. When it comes to comfort, the more premium headsets tend to do better, so again it can be a matter of paying more to get more.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"build-quality-and-styling-what-to-look-out-for\">Build quality and styling: What to look out for</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although wear and tear is an inevitable result of using a gaming headset, some will stand up to the rigors of gaming better than others simply because they&rsquo;re made from tougher stuff. Ideally you&rsquo;ll want a gaming headset that has a metal frame and headband for durability, since plastic ones break quite easily. Metal bands also look more premium, so it&rsquo;s a win-win. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cushioning for the headband and earcups can be made from leather, velour, pleather, or foam. Leather and pleather (fake leather) look and feel luxurious. They also tend to be the most resistant to wear, but these materials aren&rsquo;t very breathable and can cause sweaty ears during long gaming sessions. Foam is the opposite in that it&rsquo;ll keep your ears cool, but disintegrate quicker. Sitting between the two, velour keeps your ears relatively cool but tends to be fairly resistant to wear and tear. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s more of a general rule than an absolute. If you do prefer a material other than velour you <em>can</em> buy anti-sweat or abrasion-resistant covers for your headset&rsquo;s earcups, which will help them last a little longer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your headphones <em>do</em> succumb to wear and tear, some manufacturers offer the option of purchasing and swapping out damaged parts. Replacing your earcups can refresh your headset&rsquo;s look and feel. But having a headset with replaceable cabling can actually save you from having to buy a whole new set if the cabling wears right through.   </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"noise-isolation-its-importance-for-sound-quality\">Noise isolation: Its importance for sound quality</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>How well your gaming headset isolates noise makes a big difference to its sound quality. This is especially the case when you&rsquo;re playing first-person shooters (FPS), where external noise can make it more difficult to locate the direction of sounds, like the footsteps of approaching enemies. In marketing materials, manufacturers will often use terms like Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and passive noise isolation, but these terms mean quite different things. Here&rsquo;s a quick definition of each:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Passive noise isolation:</strong> How well a headset can block out external noise just by forming a physical noise-blocking barrier over your ears. </li><li><strong>Active Noise Cancellation: </strong>A technology incorporated into your gaming headset that actively blocks or filters out ambient noise so the sound you hear is the clearest it can be. </li></ul><p>If possible, you&rsquo;ll want a headset that sports both passive noise isolation as well as ANC, since these noise-blocking measures both have benefits. Passive noise isolation tends to be better at blocking out higher-pitched sounds, whereas ANC is more effective at blocking out lower-pitched sounds&mdash;like background noise and the sound of traffic. How well ANC and passive noise isolation work can vary greatly among headsets, so it&rsquo;s worth doing your research to find a headset that makes the cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"surround-sound-the-secret-weapon-of-pro-gamers\">Surround sound: The secret weapon of pro gamers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Of all the technologies that come packed into gaming headsets, this one provides arguably the best tactical advantage for gamers. Headsets with surround sound utilize spatial audio technologies like Dolby Atmos to create a 360-degree soundscape. Multiple speakers deliver the sound at different positions in each earcup, telling your brain its precise location in your games. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you play FPS games like <em>Overwatch</em>,<em> Fortnite</em>, or any of the <em>Call of Duty</em> or <em>Battlefield</em> games, this can have real-time benefits, like being able to hear players sneak up on you from behind, or pinpointing the direction of grenades rolling towards you, so that you can react accordingly. It&rsquo;s the kind of technology that takes a bit of getting used to, but when you do, it can be a real game changer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Headsets with surround sound technologies tend to be expensive, so if they&rsquo;re out of your price range don&rsquo;t worry too much. Most headsets also come with decent stereo, which will still do a good job relaying the general direction of sounds. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"why-is-a-microphone-important\">Why is a microphone important?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most games use either in-game chat or external chat apps like Discord, so a decent microphone is a must-have. Mics in gaming headsets tend to come in two flavors: hyper-cardioid, that pick up the sound directly in front of them, or omnidirectional, that pick up sound from different directions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan on using your headset just for gaming, a cardioid mic should do the trick, since you can use it to chat to folks in your game and then move it away from your mouth to chat to others in the same room. If however, you plan on also using your headset for, say, work meetings as well as gaming, an omnidirectional microphone will better pick up the sound of both you and your colleagues talking. Additionally, if you plan on using your set as a pair of headphones, you&rsquo;ll need to make sure your headset&rsquo;s mic is detachable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sound clarity and ease-of-use of your microphone is also important. We suggest looking out for features like noise cancellation and sound dampening for a better-quality sound experience. For convenience, an automatic mute button is useful when you want to quickly block out any sound from your end. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\nComputers and Peripherals, Gaming, Gaming Accessories, Holidays, Logitech</div>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1367670/start-your-fifitbits-sense-2-smartwatch-is-feature-packed-and-100-off.html", "title": "The new Fitbit Sense 2 smartwatch is $100 off", "date_published": "2022-11-01 14:05:28+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section><p>If you&rsquo;re interested in living a healthier lifestyle, you&rsquo;re in luck, as we&rsquo;ve got an awesome deal on the new Fitbit Sense 2 smartwatch today. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4N2T7GL/ref=twister_B0BGK8R2SG?tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D23196519%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD&amp;xcust=2-1-1367670-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon&rsquo;s selling it for $199.95, which is a savings of $100</a>.

It&rsquo;s also $100 more than the original RTX 3090&rsquo;s debut $1499 price. Good news, however &ndash; the RTX 3090 Ti has dropped to a much lower $1099 for the Founders Edition, and sometimes can be found for less. The 3090 can often be found for under $900, and even closer to $700 if you&rsquo;re <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/826475/6-things-consider-buying-used-graphics-card.html\">OK with a used graphics card</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Availability gets more complicated: The GeForce RTX 4090 has been steadily sold out since its October 12 launch, making acquiring one a game of &ldquo;catch me if you can.&rdquo; The RTX 3090 Ti has been much more available, along with the rest of the RTX 3000 family &ndash; but it also can still sell out at its lower price. The vanilla RTA 3090 is fairly easy to find, meanwhile, but retail pricing may still be a bit high in comparison to the Ti version.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many will argue that $500 extra bucks is justified for the 4090 due to its impressive performance, but that&rsquo;s not always the case. The 3090 Ti is still very capable, especially at less than 4K resolutions or if your 4K display maxes out at 60Hz, as we&rsquo;ll find out in the performance section.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 3090\" class=\"wp-image-1364499\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screenshot-2022-10-26-at-11.43.02-AM.png?w=1054\" width=\"1054\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"nvidia-rtx-4090-vs-rtx-3090-and-ti-performance\">Nvidia RTX 4090 vs RTX 3090 (and Ti): Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For the one enthusiast left in the room that cares about this: Unlike the RTX 3090, the new RTX 4090 lacks any NVLink or SLI support whatsoever. It was already a non-issue for the 3090 and 3090 Ti when the vast majority of games have abandoned multi-GPU support, but you could at least hook them up physically if you really wanted to use the might of two titan GPUs for content creation or machine learning. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that out of the way, let&rsquo;s talk numbers. Yep, the RTX 4090 absolutely crushes anything that came before it in an almost &ldquo;meme-tastic,&rdquo; hilarious way. There are some caveats that will become clearer, especially with certain games such as <em>Gears Tactics</em>, because the 4090 is so insanely fast that it can become limited by even top-end CPUs, even at 4K resolution. Wowza.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"RTX 4090\" class=\"wp-image-1364500\" height=\"988\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cyberpunk-2077-1-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption><p>From the PCWorld RTX 4090 review.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>First let&rsquo;s look at <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> as a good example of the 4090&rsquo;s dominance. In both traditional rasterized performance and ray tracing with graphics options maxed-out, it steam rolls ahead. The RTX 3090 falls short of the 60fps goal for 4K (though it could hit that by dropping some graphics settings), and even its 3090 Ti variant can barely scratch that golden standard. The 4090 clears the bar easily, pulling a significant lead.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"RTX 4090\" class=\"wp-image-1364501\" height=\"988\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/gears-tactics-1-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption><p>From the PCWorld RTX 4090 review.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Things get a bit more interesting when we look at <em>Gears Tactics</em>. The 1440p performance difference is reasonable as all of these are monster GPUs pushing the game (and your CPU) to its limits, but the 4k performance gap is even more pronounced.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We uncovered another novelty during our 4K testing for <em>Gears Tactics</em>: While it ran 67 percent faster than the 3090, it was bottlenecked by the CPU seven percent of the time. This is highly unusual at 4K, where the GPU is typically the entire bottleneck. It demonstrates how capable the RTX 4090 truly is, as it could theoretically achieve even more if unleashed fully.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"core-i9-13900k\">Core i9-13900K</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Core i9-13900K\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/070A9689_V31.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2000\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>This means that if you&rsquo;re going for the GeForce RTX 4090, even at 4K, you&rsquo;ll want to pair a highly capable modern CPU with it, such as the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1074246/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-review.html\">AMD Ryzen 7950X</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357979/intel-core-i9-13900k-review.html\">Intel Core i9-13900K</a>. You&rsquo;d expect most users to do so anyway due to the pricing tier, but now the 4090 demands the fastest possible chip you can throw at it, even at higher resolutions. (It&rsquo;s still not the case with every 4K or above game, as most are still GPU bottlenecked, even with a 4090.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, the GeForce RTX 3090 and 3090 Ti will typically not bottleneck or show any performance difference amongst many varying CPUs at 4K, and even 1440p often has negligible variations. You&rsquo;ll still want a good, fast chip &ndash; but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be a screamer like the RTX 4090 demands.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 3090\" class=\"wp-image-1364502\" height=\"572\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screenshot-2022-10-26-at-11.43.15-AM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s why the 3090 and 3090 Ti are still especially great choices for those at 1440p and below resolutions, and for gaming at 4K on a 60Hz display. The performance gains under 4K on the 4090 aren&rsquo;t as significant, especially when accounting for CPU bottlenecks. The true gains will be at higher resolutions, so many gamers may find the 3090 class GPUs are more than enough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can&rsquo;t talk about performance and not bring up Nvidia&rsquo;s <em>piece de resistance</em>: DLSS 3.0. The RTX 4090 contains much more powerful hardware in the form of its optical flow accelerators. While the 3090 and 3090 Ti contain some flavor of this technology, they are not powerful enough to convincingly pull off DLSS 3.0.&nbsp; Frame generation with its AI chops really bring healthy gains not found in the regular DLSS 2.0, as impressive as that one is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this a big deal? It can be if your game supports it. It will be especially useful with ray tracing, which traditionally gives you a performance penalty &ndash; but that can be negated with DLSS 3.0 even more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demanding games such as Flight Simulator 2020 are perfect examples of impressive gains: You can often double your frame rate while keeping visual fidelity high. In a case such as this, where even a 3090 Ti will struggle with DLSS 2.0 to maintain high frame rates, your use case for a 4090 may very well be justified. Note, however, that while DLSS 3.0 is able to greatly accelerate raw frame rates by inserting AI-generated images every other frame, you <em>won&rsquo;t</em> necessarily <em>feel</em> like the game is performing faster, as responsiveness can be affected by those AI insertions.

(This is especially true at 4K, and when DLSS 3.0 and ray tracing enter the mix.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the right price, however, the RTX 3090 and 3090 Ti still put up a valiant effort that are more than enough performance at 1440p or 4K/60Hz levels, while not requiring the fastest CPU like the RTX 4090.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"nvidia-rtx-4090-vs-3090-3090-ti-power-and-other-things-to-know\">Nvidia RTX 4090 vs 3090/3090 Ti: Power and other things to know</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically both the GeForce RTX 4090 and 3090 Ti share a TDP of 450W, while the original RTX 3090 draws &ldquo;only&rdquo; 350W.

It&rsquo;s a tough call. It will depend solely on price and your use case performance-wise. If you&rsquo;re after an RTX 3090, a used one may be your best bet if it was well taken care of. (VRAM thermal issues were an issue with some Founders Edition GPUs.) If you get it cheaply enough, the RTX 3090 may still be very suitable for you.&nbsp;At 1440p, it still crushes many games, even with ray tracing, and the RTX 3090 remains no slouch at 4K/60 gaming either. DLSS 2.0 is not as capable as the electrified DLSS 3.0, but it still is very potent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RTX 3090 Ti is a more &ldquo;refined&rdquo; version of the RTX 3090, with slightly more performance, and typically better thermal design with VRAM. Once again, it all depends on the price that you can get it for&mdash;its $1099 retail price is <em>significantly</em> cheaper than before, but quickly approaching the MSRP of the impending RTX 4080 16GB at $1199, and potentially whatever RDNA 3 competitor pops up from AMD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either of these graphics cards will serve you well. But at this point, if you aren&rsquo;t splurging on an RTX 4090, we would advise waiting for both the GeForce RTX 4080 16GB and AMD&rsquo;s RDNA 3 counter-punch to materialize, as we&rsquo;re very close to both hitting the streets. They may make more sense than the 3090 and 3090 Ti depending on pricing. Their existence will at least push down the price of the RTX 30-series GPUs even further, making your bounty more plentiful if you&rsquo;re patient.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, it&rsquo;s clear the RTX 4090 is the dominant GPU for now&mdash;if you can find one and don&rsquo;t mind paying an eye-watering price for eye-watering performance.</p>\nGPUs</div>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1358842/acer-chromebook-spin-513-review-a-wonderful-display-but-youll-pay-for-it.html", "title": "Acer Chromebook Spin 513 review: Long-lasting and spacious", "date_published": "2022-11-01 10:30:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section><div class=\"review\" id=\"review-body\"><span class=\"review-title\">At a glance</span><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"experts-rating\">Expert's Rating</h3><div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n<div><div class=\"review-columns\"><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"pros\">Pros</h3><ul class=\"pros review-list\"><li>Sharp 13.5-inch display with 3:2 aspect ratio</li><li>Great keyboard&nbsp;</li><li>Excellent battery life</li><li>Good Android game performance</li></ul></div><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"cons\">Cons</h3><ul class=\"cons review-list\"><li>Mediocre build quality</li><li>Touchpad could be better</li><li>Speakers lack volume&nbsp;</li><li>CPU performance falls behind AMD and Intel</li></ul></div></div></div><h3 class=\"review-subTitle review-subTitle--borderTop\" id=\"our-verdict\">Our Verdict</h3><p class=\"verdict\">Acer&rsquo;s Chromebook Spin 513 is a solid, long-lasting 2-in-1 with a surprisingly excellent display.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Chromebooks have a reputation for low pricing, but a few buck the trend. Acer&rsquo;s new Chromebook Spin 513-2H-K627 is one such exception. It delivers several key upgrades over less expensive alternatives including a tack-sharp screen and great battery life, but are these upgrades worth a premium price? Let&rsquo;s dive in and find out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"acer-chromebook-spin-512-specs-and-features\">Acer Chromebook Spin 512 specs and features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Acer Chromebook Spin 513-2H-K627 has a MediaTek Kompanio 1380 SoC with Mali-G57 MC5 graphics. This is a recent MediaTek chip announced in January of 2022 that specifically targets Chromebooks. It&rsquo;s paired with 8GB LPDDR4X memory and 128GB of eMMC storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>CPU: MediaTek Kompanio 1380</li><li>Memory: 8GB LPDDR4X</li><li>Graphics/GPU: Mali-G57 MC5</li><li>Display: 2256 x 1504 IPS touchscreen</li><li>Storage: 128GB eMMC</li><li>Webcam: 720p</li><li>Connectivity: 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 with Power Delivery and DisplayPort Alternate Mode, 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 with Power Delivery, 1x USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, MicroSD card, 3.5mm audio</li><li>Networking: Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.1</li><li>Biometrics: None</li><li>Battery capacity: 45 watt-hours</li><li>Dimensions: 11.81 x 9.25 x .64 inches</li><li>Weight: 2.82</li><li>MSRP: $599.99</li></ul><p>Priced at $599.99, the Chromebook Spin 513 remains affordable. However, its hardware specifications don&rsquo;t seem to justify the price. A large number of Windows and ChromeOS devices pack superior AMD, Intel, and even Qualcomm processors, and often for less.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"design-and-build-quality\">Design and build quality</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Chromebook Spin design\" class=\"wp-image-1361546\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/acer-chromebook-spin-513-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Acer&rsquo;s Chromebook Spin 513 relies on the simple, functional aesthetic found on many recent Acer Chromebook devices. It has a basic, though not unattractive, gunmetal exterior with a metal lid and lower chassis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interior differs slightly in color, with more of a silver-charcoal look. I don&rsquo;t think the color difference is intended but simply the result of Acer&rsquo;s varying use of materials. The 2-in-1&rsquo;s seams do a good job of hiding this and I doubt most owners will notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a 2-in-1 device with a touchscreen and 360-degree hinge. The display can rotate back until it touches the &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; of the laptop, effectively making it a tablet. Tablet mode is useful for short bursts but not a serious iPad or Android tablet replacement. The Chromebook Spin 513 weighs in at 2.82 pounds and is .64 inches thick. Both specifications make it a bit unwieldy to handle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, the display can be rotated partially back, which turns the keyboard into a stand for the display. This &ldquo;tent mode,&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s often called, is great for general use in a tight space (like a packed coffee shop or airplane) and perfect for watching Netflix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 360-degree design puts a lot of stress on both the hinges, and I&rsquo;m not sure Acer&rsquo;s build quality is up to the task. The metal display lid feels nice when touched but does allow some flex, and the hinges seem clad in plastic (though I&rsquo;d wager the internals are metal). The keyboard also allows minor flex when typing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve handled far less impressive Chromebooks, to be sure, but the Chromebook Spin 513 is a relatively expensive model. A metal interior panel or some added display reinforcement would be appreciated at this price.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"keyboard-and-trackpad\">Keyboard and trackpad</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Chromebook Spin keyboard\" class=\"wp-image-1361548\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/acer-chromebook-spin-513-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Touch typists will like the Chromebook Spin 513&rsquo;s keyboard. It has a spacious layout and large keys, each of which activates with lengthy key travel and some tactile feedback. I do find the bottoming action a bit vague, but this is a nitpick: the keyboard is immediately comfortable and familiar under my fingertips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The touchpad is less impressive. It offers a reasonable amount of space, measuring about 3.5 inches wide and 3 inches deep. The surface is smooth and it responds well to input. Yet the touchpad proves finicky when using multitouch gestures. Scrolling is overly sensitive and never quite stops where desired.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the touchpad can be bypassed by using the touchscreen, and the 2-in-1 design makes this convenient. The touchscreen is large, responsive, and smooth, though no more so than any other Windows or ChromeOS 2-in-1.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"display-audio\">Display, audio</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Chromebook Spin display\" class=\"wp-image-1361549\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/acer-chromebook-spin-513-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Display quality is arguably the Acer Chromebook Spin 513&rsquo;s defining trait. It comes with a 13.5-inch, 2,256 x 1,504 IPS touchscreen with a pixel density of about 200 pixels per inch. That&rsquo;s not as high as a 4K display, to be certain, but in truth it&rsquo;s close enough that the difference will be hard to notice. Content is crystal-clear and small fonts appear crisp with no hint of aliasing around edges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The display also offers a 3:2 aspect ratio, which is closer to square than the more common 16:9 or 16:10 aspect ratio. As a result, the 13.5-inch screen feels much taller than expected. The wealth of vertical display real estate makes it especially awesome for use with web sites, documents, and spreadsheets. It&rsquo;s not as good for streaming, as you&rsquo;ll often see large black bars above and below content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brightness is decent at a maximum of 359 nits. That&rsquo;s enough for general use indoors but it can be a problem near a window on a sunny day. The glossy display doesn&rsquo;t help, of course, since it allows significant glare and reflections and easily shows fingerprints.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Image quality is otherwise great for the price. The Chromebook Spin 513 offers respectable color performance and good detail. Contrast is where it falls short: movies and games lack depth and dark scenes look hazy. Still, the display is sharper and more colorful than most comparable devices. A typical Windows alternative, like an Acer Spin 5 or Lenovo Yoga 6, will have a lower display resolution. Many also have a less spacious 16:9 display aspect ratio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The built-in speakers are a disappointment. Blame their volume. The downward-facing speakers are quiet even at maximum. Audio quality is fine but, at the volume available here, I would expect that&mdash;there&rsquo;s not enough oomph to cause distortion or harshness. Most people will need to attach external speakers or headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"webcam-microphone-biometrics\">Webcam, microphone, biometrics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A simple 720p webcam with a microphone is packed in the Chromebook Spin 513&rsquo;s thin upper bezel. It produces a usable image and handles mixed lighting fairly well, but image quality is soft and grainy. The microphone is similar: it&rsquo;s loud enough for a video call or meeting, but its presentation is distant and hollow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2-in-1 doesn&rsquo;t offer biometrics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"connectivity\">Connectivity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A pair of USB-C ports provide most of the Chromebook Spin 513&rsquo;s connectivity. Both offer power delivery, and the port on the right side supports DisplayPort Alternate mode. The USB-C ports are joined by a single USB-A port, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a microSD card reader.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an acceptable, though not outstanding, range of connectivity for a Chromebook. The only port I miss is HDMI. The Chromebook Spin 513 requires an adapter to connect to a monitor or TV over HDMI, which is annoying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wireless connectivity is typical with support for Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1. The Chromebook Spin 513 lacks support for the latest Wi-Fi 6E standard, but that&rsquo;s acceptable on an inexpensive laptop. I had no issues with wireless connectivity in my time with the device.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"performance\">Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Acer&rsquo;s Chromebook Spin 513 opts for an ARM-based MediaTek Kompanio 1380 SoC with eight cores and Mali-G57 graphics. This is a bit unusual, as most Chromebooks that rely on ARM aim for a lower price point. The SoC is supported by 8GB of memory and 128GB of eMMC storage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how the Chromebook Spin 513 performed in ChromeOS benchmarks.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>CrXPRT 2 performance score: 86</li><li>Speedometer 2.0: 45</li><li>Basemark Web 3.0: 632.32</li><li>Kraken Javascript 1.1: 1440.7</li><li>Jetstream: 170.53</li></ul><p>How these scores look depends on the perspective. When compared against other ARM-based Chromebooks like <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/609500/hp-chromebook-x2-11-da0023dx-review.html\">HP&rsquo;s Chromebook x2 11</a>, the Chromebook Spin 513 does well. However, it still lands far behind the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/564116/lenovo-chromebook-flex-5-review-the-reasonable-choice.html\">Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5</a>, which performs much better across all five benchmarks (and does so at a lower price).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putting scores to the side, the Chromebook Spin 513 feels speedy in day-to-day use. It can handle a dozen open browser tabs with ease and moves quickly between windows. Video streaming is free of hesitation, even when connected to a 4K monitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chromebook Spin 513 handles Android games well. <em>Call of Duty Mobile</em>, <em>Pokemon Unite</em>, and <em>Asphalt 8</em> played well at default settings with no sign of dropped frames or hesitation. The games loaded quickly, too, making it easy to jump in for a match. The same can&rsquo;t be said of AMD and Intel-based Chromebooks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"battery-life\">Battery life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Battery life is often a perk of ChromeOS devices, and the Chromebook Spin 513 is no exception. It managed to deliver almost 12 hours and 34 minutes of battery life in the CrXPRT 2 battery life benchmark. The Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5, powered by an Intel Pentium processor, lasted eight hours and 22 minutes in the same benchmark.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenovo&rsquo;s ThinkPad X13s, a Windows laptop with an ARM-based Qualcomm processor, lasted slightly longer at 12 hours and 53 minutes (but was tested with video loop, not CrXPRT 2). The ThinkPad X13s is more expensive, however, with a base MSRP around $1,000. Most price-competitive Windows laptops and 2-in-1s will deliver around six to eight hours of battery life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, the Chromebook Spin 513 has great battery life and will outperform most devices available at a similar price. It can last a full eight-hour work day in most situations and will handle a flight across the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Acer&rsquo;s Chromebook Spin 513 is defined by its display. The 13.5-inch display&rsquo;s uncommon 3:2 aspect ratio and sharp resolution add up to a surprising amount of usable screen space. It&rsquo;s perfect for browsing the web or editing documents&mdash;which are the tasks Chromebooks are best suited for.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The excellent display is supported by great battery life and an enjoyable keyboard, but it&rsquo;s not all good news. Audio quality is disappointing, the touchpad is just average, and performance doesn&rsquo;t stand out (though game performance is decent).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These problems hold the Chromebook Spin 513 short of greatness, but it still remains a good option for ChromeOS fans who want a big, attractive touchscreen with tons of usable space.&nbsp;</p>\nLaptops</div>", "favourite": false}]
