<p>hiSHtory is a better shell history. It stores your shell history in context (what directory you ran the command it, whether it succeeded or failed, how long it took, etc). This is all stored locally and end-to-end encrypted for syncing to to all your other computers. All of this is easily queryable via Control-R and via the hishtory CLI. This means from your laptop, you can easily find that complex bash pipeline you wrote on your server, and see the context in which you ran it.</p>

The websites for most of these packages list the price as "Contact Us," and I'd like to avoid spending the next month in sales calls.<p>Is there a website or service that lists cost ranges for enterprise SaaS products?<p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

<p>I'm developing Hyperstep[0], a spatial language for music production.<p>I find using existing DAWs frustrating because they don't allow me to navigate and operate intuitively on the latent spaces behind my musical ideas.<p>This is why I've decided to build my own set of "seeing tools".(Bret Victor)[1].<p>I'm also convinced that by framing music as processes and interactions in the 3D world, spatialization and mixing should become fairly pain-free.<p>I'm still early in development and I would love to build this into an actual product that can be integrated into existing DAWs or even turn it into a musical framework itself for AR and VR experiences.<p>If you're interested in working on it or if you simply want to know more, feel free to contact me.

<p>As a personal project I wrote a really tiny Wat 2 Wasm compiler in Go. Mainly for demonstrative and educational purposes. It was tough: I didn't know anything about WebAssembly internals and I'm a newbie with Go... so I tried to document it as much as I could for anyone that would like to approach the quest in the future!<p>It misses a lot of features (that will be gradually implemented).<p>Any feedback is welcomed!!<p>Demo: <a href="https://luna-demo.vercel.app" rel="nofollow">https://luna-demo.vercel.app</a></p>

## Launch HN: SimpleHash (YC W22) – API to query digital assets
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33423759](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33423759)

<p>Hi HN! We’re Alex Kilkka and Olly Wilson, co-founders of SimpleHash (<a href="https://www.simplehash.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.simplehash.com</a>).  We allow developers to fetch comprehensive NFT / digital asset data from many blockchains at once.<p>Using our API, developers don’t have to worry about how different chains like Ethereum, Solana, and Flow implement digital assets under the hood. We collect, standardize, and cache all this information for you, so you can retrieve it in a single request.<p>There has been a lot of controversy and hype around NFTs, but we’re focused on solving the technical challenges that our customers (software developers working with digital assets) deal with on a day-to-day basis. We don’t hold, transfer, mint or issue any form of crypto or digital asset ourselves–instead we aim to be the most comprehensive data provider for people who need to programmatically access this kind of information and media.<p>Working with digital asset data is harder than other kinds of blockchain data. For a given item, you typically have to go to 3 separate places to get data–which oftentimes includes a decentralized storage system (such as IPFS or Arweave) that may time out or be unavailable. To pull the ownership history requires parsing through the extensive log history of a blockchain. And that’s just for one NFT on one chain.<p>We’re building SimpleHash because our co-founder Alex experienced these pain points at his last startup, an NFT showcasing product called showtime.xyz. While there he built out an in-house indexer because no suitable alternatives existed for getting cross-chain data. After leaving showtime, Alex teamed up with me (we're friends from college) to help fill this gap in developer tooling.<p>As digital asset activity has moved across chains and ecosystems, it’s become increasingly difficult for companies to deal with this data in-house. Our indexer has now ingested half a billion assets across 16 blockchain networks, including testnets, and the volume and complexity is only growing.<p>SimpleHash is doing a number of things differently than other solutions. We generate thumbnails and blurhashes for images, along with SVG to PNG conversion (to improve compatibility with mobile apps). We pull in marketplace data, like floor prices and sales transactions, even from sources that do listings off-chain. We provide a spam score to help apps like wallets filter out unwanted NFTs. We provide enterprise-grade support and integration assistance, which many companies expect in web2, but is hard to find in web3. We’re one of the few options to have comprehensive coverage of both mainnets and testnets.<p>If you’re a developer building in the space, we’d love for you to try the API. You can read the full documentation here: <a href="https://simplehash.readme.io/reference/overview" rel="nofollow">https://simplehash.readme.io/reference/overview</a>, and generate API keys here: <a href="https://app.simplehash.com/" rel="nofollow">https://app.simplehash.com/</a>. We have a free tier for experimentation and testing, and beyond that our pricing model is request based, similar to other APIs. If you need help with anything, feel free to contact us at founders@simplehash.com.<p>We launched the initial version of the API coming out of YC and have had strong reception so far—we’re now serving some of the leading web3 wallets, like Phantom and Rainbow, and dozens of other players. Please don’t hesitate to share your feedback and questions.<p>Thank you!</p>

## Tell HN: The issues of Twitter are not a technical problem to solve

<p>I am seeing so many posts here about Twitter and it's possible alternatives. People are going on and on about<p>- What could be the next big thing<p>- What they want from new platform<p>- What tech stack they would use and so on<p>It's like there's fire in the house and all of us are discussing how to improve fire extinguisher design. The issues of Twitter are not a technical problem to solve. No amount of algorithms can improve human behavior on any platform. It's good that we at least see the issues that have surfaced because of Twitter and other platforms. We now know people<p>- can have extremely polarized views<p>- feel the need to defend their polarized but flawed viewpoint at any cost<p>- are virtue signaling others but refuse to take any accountability whatsoever<p>- have less and less attention span<p>- only consume the content that aligns with their views<p>I can list another dozen issues but you get the point. Instead of trying to fix Twitter we need to look into why these things are happening. It does not seem like a technical problem that the HN crowd wants to solve. It's more of a personal, interpersonal and a social problem which needs extensive research, surveys to find the "why" and how we might be able to fix it or avoid it from happening again.</p>

## Meticulous (YC S21) Is Hiring #3 Founding Engineer in London

<p>Hey HN,<p>I'm Gabriel, founder of Meticulous.<p>Our mission is to make the world's code safe, performant and reliable. We're starting with a tool to catch JavaScript regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor and Google. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching JavaScript regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from automatic UI previews to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite (few days per week) founding engineer to join our team of four.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href="https://sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site/Meticulous-values-ab2b90d3324447d58f0720481081c9a6" rel="nofollow">https://sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site/Meticulous-values...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with “HN” in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub.</p>

## Ask HN: How would you design an alternative Twitter

<p>So much talk about Twitter alternatives in recent days, including people migrating to Mastodon and even Jack Dorsey announcing his new decentralized social media platform.<p>I was thinking, if I was to build a new micro-blogging aka Twitter alternative, what technological choices would I make to get it quickly off the ground but allow for scale?<p>What database technology or approach would you go for?<p>Would you build a (mobile first) web application first or would you start straight away with a native iOS/Android app (maybe Flutter)?<p>Would you go for a centralised or decentralized approach? If the latter, how would you decentralize it without sacrificing the "public town square" effect that Twitter currently has but is clearly lacking with the fragmentation of Mastodon?<p>To answer my own question, I would probably build a centralized platform like Twitter is now, probably opt for a fast NoSQL database like Google's Firestore in Datastore mode and to keep things simple I would probably even make sure that tweets would get automatically deleted after some years as I don't think it's needed to build a forever growing database of people's thoughts in that moment that persists for decades to come. Micro-blogging always felt to me as a thing right now, a thought in this moment but that thought could be different in a few days, months and definitely a few years, so why store it forever. Feels like I could save a huge operational cost and prevent abuse by not keeping tweets for beyond their relevancy.<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

## Lenovo Coil Whine – Is it fixable? Or is it a reason to stay away from Lenovo?

<p>I recently bought a Lenovo X1 Carbon. It makes an annoying high pitched sound. At first I thought it would be the fans and it will go away when I configure the dynamic fan speed.<p>But it turns out it is "Coil Whine" and that is common among Lenovo laptops:<p>https://www.google.com/search?q=coil+whine+lenovo<p>I cannot find any info on how to get rid of it.<p>So I will try to return the laptop. If I can't return it (Already removed Windows and replaced it with Linux), it would be a 100% wasted investment.<p>Since I otherwise liked it, I wonder what replacement to buy.<p>Are any Lenovo models safe from Coil Whine?</p>

<p>I say “most” because you’re reading this on HN.<p>I haven’t had FB for over 6 years and I don’t use Twitter. I primarily find the internet to be a distraction these days and considering just phasing out news all together for weeks at a time. Has anyone done something similar?<p>In the past people have been harsh to call me ill informed for not being up to date on all things media, but to what end does this actually benefit the individual? My argument is that it’s mostly a detriment given the state of the world.<p>For those that have experimented with “going dark” in a sense, how was it, what did you do and what’s a good balance?</p>
