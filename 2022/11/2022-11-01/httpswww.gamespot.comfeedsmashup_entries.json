Obviously, I have a very close connection to the character,\" Cavill explained. \"There is something extraordinarily special about him. Extraordinarily special about his capacity to give and to love. I don\u2019t mean romantically; I mean his love for Earth and for the people who live here, and to make people feel powerful--to make people feel like Superman themselves.\"</p><p>\"I have plenty of desires for this, of course, which will be discussed more in time,\" Cavill continued. \"But the most important thing, which I will be aiming for, is for the audience to leave the cinema and to feel like they can fly, to feel like they can protect, and to feel like they want to give to everyone else.

If you're a new or returning player, the game might feel a bit overwhelming with fast-paced action and complicated gun customization. Here we provide some of the best tips to help you find success in Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Adjust your game settings</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Don't just stick with the game's default settings. There are tons of settings for audio, visual, and input devices that you'll likely want to change beyond the default options. Turning off settings like motion blur, film grain, and depth of field will help with visibility. There are also settings like changing the Field of View to zoom out and see more information on the map. For those on console, we have a <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-settings-for-cod-modern-warfare-2-controller-layouts-sensitivity-and-more/1100-6508566/\">recommended settings guide</a> for getting the most out of Modern Warfare 2 on Xbox or PlayStation consoles.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Use a headset</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Use a headset if you're able. This is a no-brainer for communicating with teammates, which is especially important in objective-based modes. However, it also gives more accurate map awareness, as you can better hear enemy footsteps to try and determine their positioning. Listen for the change in footstep audio to determine if the enemy is getting closer or moving further away. A headset also makes it easier to determine if the enemy is walking on the floor above or below you.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-multiplayer-tips/1100-6508807/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/steam-decks-most-popular-title-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-gamespot-news/2300-6459897/", "title": "Steam Deck's Most Popular Title Coming to Xbox Game Pass | GameSpot News", "date_published": "2022-11-01 20:48:00+00:00", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1574/15746725/4057213-20221101_xboxgamepassnovember_newsv2.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> One of Steam Deck\u2019s most popular games is coming to Game Pass, Modern Warfare 2 leak hints at much beloved mode returning, and Fortnite gets some crucial Star Wars skins.

Players who have the card can input the 25-digit-code found on it and unlock in-game rewards, and even though the card game is out of print, the codes still work to this day.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-will-soon-give-players-a-3000-mount-for-free-and-its-causing-a-bit-of-an-uproar/1100-6508805/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-how-to-unlock-all-mastery-camos/1100-6508804/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 - How To Unlock All Mastery Camos", "date_published": "2022-11-01 19:22:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii/\">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</a> is now available, and as always with a new Call of Duty game, there is a new camo grind to pursue. Modern Warfare 2 includes several base weapon camo challenges, but the most sought after are the four Completionist mastery camos. The mastery camos look really stunning this year, and our guide will walk you through the steps needed to unlock these coveted weapon camos.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">How to unlock mastery camo challenges</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Modern Warfare 2 camos are divided into two types: Base and Mastery. Before you can unlock the fancy mastery camos, you'll need to acquire base camos first. Base camos are a bit different this year, but in a surprisingly good way. There are over 180 base camos, and they are all universal this year. Meaning, once you unlock a base camo for one weapon, you'll be able to apply it to all other weapons in your arsenal. These are no longer weapon-specific base camos.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There are a maximum of four base camo challenges for each Gunsmithable weapon in the game, and you'll get access to these camo challenges as you level up the weapon. These vary from weapon to weapon, but these are simple challenges like getting a certain amount of kills, double kills, and such. Launchers and melee weapons (weapons without attachments) that aren't customizable in the Gunsmith only have one base challenge each.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-how-to-unlock-all-mastery-camos/1100-6508804/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-a-full-year-of-walmart-for-just-49-until-november-3/1100-6508803/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Get A Full Year Of Walmart+ For Just $49 Until November 3", "date_published": "2022-11-01 19:20:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Black Friday is just a few weeks away, making now a great time to pick up a Walmart+ subscription.

For once, we're not talking about Telesto. A few weeks ago, Lord of Wolves was temporarily disabled from the game after Bungie discovered that it had been <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-exotic-shotgun-lord-of-wolves-temporarily-disabled-after-unintentional-damage-boost/1100-6508436/\">doing far more damage than it was originally intended to</a>.</p><p>The powerful shotgun, which has a perk that allows for it to auto-fire a tight spread of slugs when active, was once again fine-tuned to be more balanced in PvP activities. A 25% universal base damage buff was removed and replaced with a 40% PvE buff, with the gun's ADS accuracy penalty dropping significantly. That fix was only temporary, though, and Bungie found that Lord of Wolves was still doing too much damage on top of its Release the Wolves perk.</p><p>This issue has been addressed in this week's patch, and another bug related to the extra 20% bonus to aim assist fall-off not being removed from the Rangefinder ability on the shotgun, has also been resolved. This is just one of several ongoing overhauls for weapons in Destiny 2, as a recent <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/almost-every-destiny-2-weapon-subtype-is-getting-a-small-overhaul-in-a-mid-season-update/1100-6508295/\">mid-season patch</a> saw a wide number of weapon archetypes go under the microscope and get granular adjustments.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-update-6-2-5-2-gives-lord-of-wolves-another-tweak/1100-6508800/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracer-shuts-down-hitman-go-studio-as-new-deus-ex-revealed-at-eidos-montreal/1100-6508798/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Embracer Shuts Down Hitman Go Studio, As New Deus Ex Revealed At Eidos Montreal", "date_published": "2022-11-01 18:33:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Embracer Group, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-lord-of-the-rings-video-games-may-be-on-the-horizon-with-embracers-10000-developers/1100-6508425/\">a gaming giant with 10,000 employees around the world</a>, is closing one of its Canadian development studios. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-01/embracer-group-shuts-down-montreal-video-game-studio\">Bloomberg</a> reports that Embracer is closing Onoma, the Montreal-based studio previously known as Square Enix Montreal that was known best for its \"Go\" games like Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go.

humorous twin-stick shooter with cartoon graphics inspired by The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show and other cartoons from the era. Your job is to hunt ghosts with your plasma blaster and vacuum pack that is reminiscent of Luigi's Mansion. Dead End Job can be played solo, but it's probably best played with a friend via local co-op. It supports drop-in, drop-out cooperative ghost-hunting for the entire adventure. Thanks to procedurally generated levels, no two runs will feel exactly the same.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-with-gold-free-games-for-november-2022-available-now/1100-6508717/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-free-games-for-november-2022-are-available-now/1100-6508602/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "PlayStation Plus Free Games For November 2022 Are Available Now", "date_published": "2022-11-01 16:51:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">November is here, and so are the latest free games for PS Plus subscribers. November's PlayStation Plus free games lineup includes Nioh 2, Lego Harry Potter Collection, and Heavenly Bodies. The trio of freebies are available to claim until December 6. As usual, all PS Plus subscribers, regardless of tier, can snag the PS Plus Essentials free games for November. </p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Nioh 2</strong> is a yokai-slaying action game from Team Ninja that combines the pinpoint swordplay of Ninja Gaiden with the mechanics of Dark Souls. If you're up for that sort of thing, it's one of the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-8-best-souls-like-games-to-play-in-2022/1100-6501667/\">best Souls-likes</a> around, and is <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-nioh-2-still-stands-out-in-the-soulslike-space/1100-6508298/\">definitely worth a look</a>. Both the PS5 and PS4 versions of Nioh 2 are free.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The <strong>Lego Harry Potter Collection</strong> is not the most recent Lego video game out there, as it was released in 2016, but it's regarded as one of the best by reviewers and fans alike. This collection combines <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lego-harry-potter-years-1-4-review/1900-6267856/\">Years 1-4</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lego-harry-potter-years-5-7-review/1900-6346755/\">Years 5-7</a> into one game.

Of course, no Apex Legends season is complete without a brand-new battle pass, and Season 15 is no different; the new season launched alongside the Eclipse battle pass, which features 110 levels of stunning, spooky cosmetics for legends and weapons alike.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But cosmetics aren't all the Eclipse Battle Pass has to offer--it's also packed with other tricks and treats, like stat trackers, Crafting Metals, Apex Packs, and Apex Coins. Keep reading for a level-by-level breakdown of this season's new cosmetics, along with a closer look at the non-cosmetic goodies included in the new battle pass (and where you'll find them).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Keeping in line with previous battle passes, the Eclipse battle pass comes in two flavors. The standard version--which costs 950 Apex Coins ($9.50 USD)--allows those who purchase it to access the battle pass's premium rewards, and instantly unlocks the following items:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\">A Deleted Message transition screen</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Archon Catalyst legend skin (Epic)</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Shadow Sorcerer Seer legend skin (Epic)</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Astral Treasure Loba legend skin (Epic)</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Obsidian Night Havoc weapon skin (Legendary)</li><li dir=\"ltr\">+10% XP Boost</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">The second form of the battle pass is an expanded version that costs 2,800 Apex Coins ($28 USD). It is identical to the standard premium battle pass, with one exception: Instead of starting off at level 1, players who purchase this version of the battle pass will automatically be boosted to Level 25 of the battle pass, giving them instant access to the first quarter of the battle pass's contents. This is a perfect option for players who are short on time, or are currently <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/weve-reached-peak-battle-pass-and-i-can-no-longer-keep-up-with-my-favorite-games/1100-6508089/\">trying to complete multiple battle passes</a> from other games while also keeping up with the Eclipse Battle pass.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Regardless of which type of premium battle pass you choose, the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-3-brings-crypto-charge-rifle-a/1100-6469960/\">Charge Rifle</a> is getting the reactive weapon treatment, with two Legendary-tier reactive Charge Rifle weapon skins available at levels 100 and 110 of the Eclipse battle pass. What makes reactive Legendary weapon skins differ from standard Legendary cosmetics is the skins' ability to \"evolve\" in appearance as you rack up kills over the course of a match. The more kills you rack up, the more flamboyant the weapon skin's \"reaction\" becomes, often glowing and/or moving. Reaching level 100 will earn you the Laser Eviscerator reactive Charge Rifle, while grinding out those last bonus levels to reach 110 will unlock the Cosmic Cannon reactive Charge Rifle as well.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Obviously, cosmetics aren't the only things the Eclipse Battle Pass has to offer. In addition to stat trackers for all 23 legends, the battle pass also includes the currencies and other non-cosmetic items listed below.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>XP Boosts</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">10% stacking XP Boosts will be unlocked at levels 1, 8, 14, 22, 30, 38, 46, 54, 62, and 70 of the Eclipse battle pass. XP Boosts also stack when in a party, so be sure to squad up to take advantage of the cumulative XP Boosts of your friends in addition to your own.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Apex Coins</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The game's premium currency comes in sets of 100, and can be found at levels 3, 5, 21, 29, 37, 45, 61, 69, 77, 85, 93, 95, and 100 of the Eclipse battle pass. Players who finish the battle pass will accumulate a total of 1,200 Apex Coins over the course of the Season 15.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Crafting Metals</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Crafting Metals are used to craft cosmetic skins from the \"evergreen\" cosmetic pool and purchase certain event cosmetics. Crafting Metals can be found in groups of 120 at levels 4, 13, 20, 28, 36, 44, 53, 60, 68, and 75 of the battle pass. Players who complete the entire battle pass will accumulate a total of 1,200 Crafting Metals.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Apex Packs</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">These random-roll loot boxes are guaranteed to unlock three prizes per pack, from Legendary Skins and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-heirlooms-guide/1100-6495067/\">Heirloom Shards</a> to common-tier evergreen cosmetics and varying amounts of crafting metals. Players who complete the battle pass will obtain a total of 13 Apex Packs.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Apex Packs can be unlocked at the following battle pass levels: 5 (Legendary-tier Apex Pack), 7 (x2), 22, 46, 58, 61, 63, 69, 78, 84, 86, and 99 (Epic-tier Apex Pack).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Check out the gallery below for a closer look at each and every reward included in Eclipse's spellbinding battle pass, and be sure to stay tuned for more <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/\">Apex Legends Season 15 news</a> as the season progresses.</p><p>Apex Legends is free to play on console and PC.

While some of the newer streaming services have pushed it from the winner's podium, there's actually a ton of great stuff on the service. Setting aside the countless NBC comedies, FX shows like Archer and What We Do in the Shadows, and even original series like Handmaid's Tale and Wu-Tang: An American Saga, there are just a ton of awesome movies on the service that make it worth checking out.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In terms of sci-fi movies, there's a surprisingly deep collection available. The service just recently debuted one of its best movies yet, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/prey-review-the-predator-movie-we-deserve/1900-6417926/\">Prey</a>, a Predator prequel that pits a Comanche woman against a crash-landed predator in the year 1719, but that's just the start. There's a solid collection of new and classic science fiction, from Ghostbusters up to one of our recent favorites, Sorry to Bother You.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once you've read this list below, you should check out our other streaming lists. We dug up the best science fiction on both Netflix and HBO Max, as well as looking more broadly at the best science fiction of the 1980s and of the 2010s. While most of these movies are well-known classics, we also mined deep into the lost memories of the 1980s to find television shows and cartoons that you've probably forgotten--or never heard of.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"[Various] Sign up for Hulu\">    <div class=\"buylink__container\">                                                                                                                                                                                               <div class=\"buylink__item\">                  <div class=\"buylink__image-container clickable\">                                            <img alt=\"\" class=\"buylink__image\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1591/15918215/3827691-6103076024-38091.jpg\" />                                 <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=42392&amp;u1=[subid_value]&amp;murl=https://www.hulu.com/start\"></a>                              </div>                   <div class=\"buylink__text\">                      <p class=\"buylink__title text-bold\">                        <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=42392&amp;u1=[subid_value]&amp;murl=https://www.hulu.com/start\">Sign up for Hulu</a>           </p>                                                       <p class=\"buylink__deck\">                          <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=42392&amp;u1=[subid_value]&amp;murl=https://www.hulu.com/start\">Hulu offers a 30-day free trial.</a>             </p>                                              </div>                  <div class=\"buylink__links\">                                                                                                                                                          <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=42392&amp;u1=[subid_value]&amp;murl=https://www.hulu.com/start\">See at Hulu</a>                     </div>                         </div>                     </div> </div></div><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Prey (2022)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4056137-prey.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Common sense dictates that if you're going to make a sequel to an existing property, you put the name people know somewhere in the title. Prey, however, throws caution to the wind. This is a Predator movie with Predator nowhere in the name of the movie. After Predators and The Predator, maybe that was the smart play. But Prey manages to differentiate itself in other ways, too. Instead of just changing the setting, Prey rewinds the clock all the way back to the 18th century. Set in the North American plains in 1719, Prey introduces us to Naru (Amber Midthunder), a young woman in the Comanche tribe who wants to be a hunter rather than a caretaker, and ends up having to prove herself after the tribe runs afoul of a rookie Predator that crash-landed on Earth. This spartan movie has some awesome fights, and Midthunder's turn as Naru instantly makes her an actor to watch. Even though this is a Predator movie, even though it references lines from the original, Prey is a refreshing sci-fi movie that finds new life in an iconic movie character.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Predator (1987)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4056138-predator.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Speaking of iconic characters, this is the movie that started it all. It was, of course, one of the 1980s action movies that skyrocketed Arnold Schwarzenegger to superstardom, but it also brought the original Predator to life. Directed by John McTiernan, Predator is much more than it appears at first glance. We meet a team of elite soldiers led by Dutch (Schwarzenegger), who head into the Central American jungle on a rescue mission. Early in the movie, one of the soldiers kills a scorpion, saving his friend from a nasty sting. Despite the scorpion being equipped with a deadly weapon, the soldiers prove the bigger predator--and that's the theme of this movie. Dutch's team is armed to the teeth, but that doesn't even phase the unseen alien lurking in the trees. After it takes down Dutch's team, it has to face Dutch himself--and it learns the hard way that just because you have cooler tools, doesn't mean you automatically win. This could've been a simple Schwarzenegger vehicle--an easy, mindless action movie. Instead, we got a gender-bending action-horror film with a lot to say about technology, ingenuity, and masculinity.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Predator 2 (1990)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4056139-predator-2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Predator 2 doesn't live up to Predator's high bar, but it has plenty going for it. The story moves from the <em>jungle </em>jungle to the urban jungle of a dystopian 1997 Los Angeles. Gang warfare is at an all-time high, a killer heatwave is ripping through the city, and Danny Glover's Lieutenant Mike Harrigan is waging a hopeless one-man battle against the gangs when he suddenly finds himself with a sort of guardian angel. After tearing apart two gangs, the Predator and Harrigan face off in a story that expands the Predator mythos. Decades before Tony Stark appeared in The Incredible Hulk, Lieutenant Harrigan sneaks into a Predator spacecraft and finds a Xenomorph skull among the hunters' trophies--a reference to the then-brand-new Aliens vs. Predator comics from Dark Horse. The comic gave birth to the now-eternal battle between Xenomorphs and Predators, but this Easter egg showed that it was possible to cross over in a movie. The makers of this movie couldn't have guessed what would happen when people spotted that skull in the background of their movie.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. AVP: Aliens vs Predator (2004)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4056140-avp.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Indeed, what began as a comic in 1989 became a full-blown movie in 2004. After finding a massive heat spot in the arctic, a team of explorers arrives to find an ancient pyramid far under the ice. Earth, it turns out, has been the battleground between Xenomorph aliens and Predators for thousands of years. Of course, chaos ensues, alliances are formed, and technology swapped before a few survivors make it out. This is a movie from Paul W.S. Anderson, the director of an entire library of Resident Evil movies, the first Mortal Kombat, and Monster Hunter. That means that judging it by good and bad doesn't really work. Sets and VFX carry the film's nonsensical plot, and you can have a great time with it if you go in with the right expectations.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Ghostbusters (1984)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4056141-ghostbusters.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">What can you say about Ghostbusters that hasn't been said? This movie was an accident; Dan Akyroyd wrote a dark and serious, dimension-hopping science fiction movie meant to star himself, Eddie Murphy, and John Belushi. After rewrites from Harold Ramis, they had a comedic supernatural film about the spiritual equivalent of exterminators trying to make their way in New York City. Even still, the movie used special effects unprecedented in comedies before that. And yet, for all its changes, they managed to make one of the truly unique movies of the '80s that still stands up as one of the best movies around.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Chronicles of Riddick (2004)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4056142-chronicles_of_riddick.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Like AVP, Chronicles of Riddick isn't a <em>good</em> movie, but it is a <em>fun</em> movie. Chronicles acts as a sequel to the 2000 film Pitch Black and picks up with Riddick evading capture before putting himself in the sights of a military force called the Necromongers sweeping across the galaxy. The cast is stacked for a movie that performed so poorly; aside from Vin Diesel as Riddick, the cast also features Karl Urban (Dredd, The Boys), Dame Judi Dench (Skyfall), and Thandiwe Newton (Westworld). It's Pitch Black meets Warhammer 40K meets H.R. Giger's take on the Roman Empire. It's not a good movie, but it's the only movie where you can hear Vin Diesel say the line \"It's been a long time since I smelled beautiful,\" while referring to someone other than himself.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Independence Day (1996)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4056136-independence-day.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">If Men in Black is peak Will Smith, then Independence Day is just below it. Directed by VFX blockbuster maestro Roland Emmerich (Day After Tomorrow, Moonfall), ID4--as it was called in marketing--imagines what would happen if some of our favorite conspiracy theories of the time were true. Area 51, Roswell, New Mexico, the gray aliens, all of it. And then imagines what would happen if we uploaded a virus from a Macbook to one of their ships. Watch it for Jeff Goldblum if nothing else.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Akira (1988)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4056143-akira.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">There's enough anime out there that you can never watch all of it, but among them very few are truly timeless. 1988's Akira is one of those. Despite condensing thousands of pages of manga into one film, Akira manages to bring together some of the best animation and music with an engaging story about two friends on either side of a conflict. Akira looks incredible almost 35 years later and is worth watching even if you put it on mute--it looks <em>that good</em>.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Sorry to Bother You (2018)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4056144-sorry-bother.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Have you ordered from Amazon lately? Me too. Sorry to Bother You is an anti-capitalism science fiction movie in which LaKeith Stanfield's Cassius Green becomes a telemarketer in a world increasingly dominated by one internet store. He finds his \"White Guy Voice\"--it's David Cross--and becomes a legendary telemarketer before meeting the CEO of that company, who has a plan to make his workforce more reliable than ever.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. Children of Men (2006)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4056145-children-men.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the year 2027, the world is on the brink of a societal collapse. Humanity has been infertile for eighteen years, meaning there are no children left. Refugees swarm England from strife elsewhere in the world, and Theo (Clive Owen) has to escort Kee (Claire Hope-Ashitey) to freedom and learns along the way that she's pregnant. Despite the themes of hope and renewal, Children of Men can be a bummer to watch. It's remarkable though, for several incredibly complex single-shot sequences throughout the movie, each impressive in its own right.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. Prometheus (2012)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4056123-prometheus.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Prometheus brings Ridley Scott back to the Aliens franchise, and all of the series' favorite themes along for the ride. Motherhood and pregnancy, body horror, human fallibility, dangerous artificial intelligence--it's all here. Where classic Alien movies tend to be tight and claustrophobic, this one is grandiose, with huge vistas and imaginative sets. If you're squeamish, skip this one. Really.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>12. Looper (2012)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4056146-looper.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Time travel is almost always a headache in storytelling. Except in rare cases, it ends up used to create drama rather than do anything interesting, and it always contains plot holes. That's where Looper comes in--one of the few time travel stories that seems to understand how much trouble the concept can create. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis play the present and future versions of Joe, a hitman for the mafia whose job is to assassinate marks sent from the future, back to the past. Director and writer Rian Johnson (Knives Out, The Last Jedi) tells a smart story that uses the puzzle pieces of time travel to examine cyclical violence.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>13. Source Code (2011)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4056147-source-code.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Computer simulation has become a favorite for filmmakers, especially in the last 25 years. Reaching back as far as Tron and even as recently as Free Guy, we like to imagine what kind of reality could exist within the silicon powering our computers. In reality, we can hardly simulate Grand Theft Auto V without witnessing a car stuck halfway in the pavement or getting launched to the moon because you hit a fire hydrant, but the fantasy remains. Sometimes filmmakers use it to ask questions about life and intelligence. Source Code keeps it simple with a classic action thriller, Jake Gyllenhaal plays Air Force Captain Colter Stevens, only he wakes up on a train in someone else's body and then dies eight minutes later. Stevens has been tasked with moving through the simulation to find the identity of a domestic terrorist before the eight-minute simulation ends. As he tries to find the bomber and end the time loop, Stevens is going to find out a lot more about himself--and the Source Code, the machine he's in--than he could've ever expected.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>14. District B13 (2004)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4056148-districtb13.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Not District 9--that's another movie. If you've heard of District B13, you probably know it as \"the French parkour movie.\" Like Predator 2 and Children of Men, District B13 depicts a near-future world where class disparity is worse than ever. When a neutron bomb is ticking down in the district, an undercover cop and ex-criminal have to work together to disarm it. This French action movie isn't remarkable for its plot, but for the parkour-heavy stunts, which were done without wires or CGI. Co-star David Belle is considered one of the main founders of the parkour movement, and this movie highlights the excitement of the art perfectly.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>15. Monsters (2010)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4056149-monsters.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The same way that Looper helped put Rian Johnson on the map and on the path to directing Star Wars, Monsters helped raise the profile of director Gareth Edwards, who would go on to direct 2016's Godzilla, followed by Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. That alone makes it worth watching--what was so special about it that the producers behind one of the biggest franchises in the world wanted to give the helm to this guy? This is a Kaiju movie before they came back into style. After a crash-landed exploration satellite brings alien life with it, the Northern section of Mexico is made a quarantine zone, with American and Mexican soldiers alike working to keep the alien life contained. Meanwhile, a photojournalist is tasked with finding his employer's daughter, but circumstances force them to travel through the quarantine zone together. Despite being a monster movie, Monsters uses sparse visual effects to match its minuscule $500,000 budget and instead puts the focus on its two main characters as they travel, survive, and bond through the quarantine zone.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-video-features-ben-stiller-channeling-his-inner-kratos/1100-6508788/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "God Of War Ragnarok Video Features Ben Stiller Channeling His Inner Kratos", "date_published": "2022-11-01 15:59:00+00:00", "description": "<p>God of War Ragnarok launches in a week, and to celebrate, Sony is counting down the days to its epic Nordic adventure with some family bonding.

The announcement came on the game's 25th anniversary, because of course it did. The studio released a teaser trailer to accompany the news, along with a short FAQ that covers the basics of the project.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the FAQ, Cyan explains that this Riven is currently in development, and that it is indeed a modern remake of the game, rather than a remaster. It also confirms that the game will be traversible in 3D space, rather than the point-and-click approach of the original.

However, 1997's Riven, the sequel to Myst, is perhaps their most well-regarded project overall, as it garnered a significantly better critical response than the original game. Considering that Myst has been remade and remastered countless times over the years, it makes sense that Cyan (or some other studio) would eventually make a new version.
