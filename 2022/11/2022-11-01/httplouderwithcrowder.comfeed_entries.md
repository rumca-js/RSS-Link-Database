## Watch: Horse race turns into an all-out, ALL-GIRL brawl complete with flying knees, fancy hats and a blurred crotch

	One would think a horse race would be more dignified, let alone a horse race in the glorified penal colony of Australia. But before the  Melbourne Cub 2022, it popped off on the Brisbane River walkway. It started off with two girls, then more girls got involved and we had ourselves a six-person catfight!
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/morgan-wallen-concert" target="_blank">Girl fights are fun to watch</a>. You know, provided you aren't <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/walmart-employees-cheating" target="_blank">with any of the girls</a>.

</blockquote></div><p>
	I'm thinking there was beef prior to the Ruckus on the River. One does not start a fight off with a flying knee just because they cut you in line and got the last White Claw. Whatever problem these two women had, it was always going down on sight.
</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="3a063" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32028597&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>
	Obviously, the lady in burgundy was not expecting it to go down like this. If she had, she may have remembered to wear underpants.
</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="06c7d" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32028606&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>
	Not sure if this dame was a participant in the Ruckus on the River or someone who happened to be walking by. But I promised you a fancy hat.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="75aad" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32028613&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>This woman is the hero. If you are going to get into a brawl, you want an enforcer like this on your side. No questions. No thinking. She sees one of her gals in trouble and starts reigning down blows like she was Frank Costanza at the first Festivus.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="1838b" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32028618&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>The only thing missing is the dudes watching not chanting "AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE" followed by "OI OI OI!" They must have been stunned because a fella waits his entire life to see action like this he doesn't have to pay for.</p><p>Unclear is what set the Ruckus on the River off. Feel free to share your guesses in the comment section of whatever social media app brought you here.</p><p>

## Watch: Kid Rock 'welcomes' Bill Maher to the GOP after Maher blasts school indoctrination and drag queens

He's launched a new PODCAST to do so. No, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-maher-is-a-hack" target="_blank">the irony is not lost on us</a>. Questions about his authenticity aside, it's at the very least good content. On the latest show, he welcomed from the cornfields of Romeo, Michigan, the early morning stoned pimp of the nation, the Detroit City cowboy, and the American badass... Kid Rock.</p><p>What can Maher and Rock find common ground on? Among other things, they aren't enamored by the Democrat political belief we should  introduce five-year-olds to grown men who dress like women.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

I would be a very bad parent because they would be doing things in the school that I didn’t think was appropriate.<br /><br />Not from either side or point of view. The subject itself. They are five. Can we just do blocks and the sky is blue before we get to drag queens?<br /></blockquote><p>At which point, Kid Rock welcomed Bill Maher to the Republican party. We have punch and pie.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>Yes, you would THINK we can let kids learn about colors and shapes before we introduce them to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/back-to-school-jenna-tailia" target="_blank">Jenna Talia</a>. But Bill Maher's CURRENT political party won't allow it. Bill Maher's CURRENT political party views drag queens as the literal only way to prove how tolerant you are. </p><p>The more conservatives say something is inappropriate, the more the Democrat Party makes it a part of their very being. There have always been drag shows. Then minors would <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mashable-ten-year-old-drag-queen" target="_self">dress up like women and entertain adults in bars</a>. Conservatives said, "hey, this seems inappropriate."</p><p>The left doubled down with "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mashable-ten-year-old-drag-queen" target="_self">Drag Queen Story Time</a>." Conservatives said, "guys, let's leave children alone because this is wrong."</p><p>Now we have the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/state-department-drag" target="_blank">Biden administration funding drag shows overseas</a>. It is unclear if they are "family-friendly" drag shows.</p><p>It's nice to know Bill Maher agrees with Kid Rock that that's wrong. We shouldn't indoctrinate kids. Free speech is an absolute. And when in doubt, get stoned. Rock/Maher 2022.</p><p><p>

As is neighborhood Facebook pages sharing Ring videos of kids like this young king, and saying "can you believe they did this?"</p><p>Yes. Yes, I can believe that. You left a bucket of candy out while children in masks are going from house to house. You may as well as left cat food out for the strays.

As you can imagine, many a bluecheckmark had a hot take about it. Leave it to former child star and failed pillow salesman David Hogg to have the worst one.</p><p>Instead of bluecheckmarks paying Elon Musk, Hogg thinks Elon Musk should pay the bluecheckmarks!</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Verified people are a major reason why many people are on twitter in the first place.

<p>Don't get me wrong. Charging bluecheckmarks for the glory of having a bluecheckmark sounds like a dumb idea.

The guy who played Bill is issuing a statement to the press like this:</p><blockquote>Elon Musk taking over Twitter and making it a private company with less oversight has immediately made the platform more prone to hate speech, targeted attacks, and the spread of disinformation.

If a bunch of celebrities you wouldn't know left the bird app without NBC News telling you they left the bird app are leaving the bird app, it's a PR nightmare. Musk may need to express his indifference with three memes instead of one.</p><p><p>

They are lower than influencers on the food chain because at least influencers have the skill to look pretty and build a social media following. Adult autograph seekers' only skill is yelling at celebrities on the street to scribble their name on a piece of paper, only to then put that piece of paper on eBay. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rockstar-dave-grohl-surprises-firefighters-battling-the-california-wildfires-with-bbq" target="_blank">Dave Grohl</a> isn't having it.</p><p>And he's going viral for this attempt to shame him for saying no.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Friendly reminder: don’t harass musicians for autographs ❌<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DaveGrohl?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DaveGrohl</a> told fans he stopped signing things, unless it’s for charity<br /><br />[credit: YouTube/Leo Dion] <a href="https://t.co/exH6T5qRiz">pic.twitter.com/exH6T5qRiz</a><br />— Fox 102.3 (@fox1023fm) <a href="https://twitter.com/fox1023fm/status/1580951695420686337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>I get where Grohl is coming from. For the act of signing his name on a piece of paper, some random dude who is not a fan is going to make money selling his signature to someone who is a fan and wants Grohl's name scribbled on a piece of paper for some odd reason. I never got buying autographs of celebrities you never met on your own, but different strokes and all that. Dave doesn't want to see his real fans taken advantage of.</p><p>Side note, while we're discussing music fans being taken advantage of. I can't be the only one who would support any elected official who campaigned on seizing the means of production of Ticketmaster. It's obscene. I tried to get Blink 182 tickets and had no idea what the original ticket prices even were. We all should have listened to Pearl Jam about Ticketmaster in the 90s. But we didn't. Sorry, Pearl Jam.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/taylor-hawkins-son-tribute" target="_blank">Dave Grohl</a> figures if his chicken scratch is going to bring in money, better to have it go to charity. He's a mensch.</p><p><p>
