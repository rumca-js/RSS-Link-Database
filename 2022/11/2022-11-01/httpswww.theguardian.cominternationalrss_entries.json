People always say not to discard them.<br /></strong><em><strong>Leah, London SW1</strong></em><br />Parmesan rinds<strong> </strong>are real imparters of flavour, so you\u2019re right to think twice about tossing them, Leah. \u201cWhen I was young, my parents used to give me them to chew on when I was losing my baby teeth,\u201d recalls Filippo La Gattuta, executive chef at <a href=\"https://bigmammagroup.com/es/accueil\">Big Mamma Group</a> in London. Of course, he has since found other solutions to the leftover rind predicament. \u201cMy favourite way now is to scrape the rind with a knife [just to remove the waxy coating], cut it up into small pieces, then pop in a microwave for a minute or so, until they puff up.\u201d Once cooled, you\u2019ll have the perfect, crunchy snack to accompany aperitivo hour.</p><p>If you don\u2019t have a microwave, however, make cheesy \u201cchips\u201d in the oven. Chef Theo Randall, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-italian-pantry-9781787138421\">The Italian Pantry</a>, says, \u201cSoak the rinds in about a litre of boiling water [from the kettle], then, once they\u2019re soft, cut them quite thinly and bake.\u201d The key is to get the rinds nice and soft \u2013 \u201cyou get a much nicer flavour that way\u201d \u2013 so if soaking them doesn\u2019t do the trick, transfer the lot to a pan and heat on the stove. Snack success also hinges on those rinds having been stored correctly: \u201cKeep them somewhere dry,\u201d says Randall, who pops his in a paper bag and keeps them in a plastic container in a cupboard. The Guardian\u2019s Italian food correspondent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rachel-roddy/\">Rachel Roddy</a>, meanwhile, keeps hers in the fridge but, she adds, \u201cyou could put them in an airtight container in the freezer\u201d.</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?
