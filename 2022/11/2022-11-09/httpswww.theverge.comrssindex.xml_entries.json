So far, early users have reported that the watch <a href=\"https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Android-App/Google-Pixel-Watch-overestimating-calories/td-p/5258365\">dramatically overreported calorie burn</a> due to a bug. <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/the-pixel-watch-has-a-calorie-problem/\">According to <em>Android Police</em></a>, the Pixel Watch team is aware of the issue and suggests rebooting the device could fix the problem. That said, it\u2019s an apt reminder that calorie burn isn\u2019t a reliable metric.</p>\n<p id=\"f03myR\">In the Pixel Watch\u2019s case, the bug appears to have impacted how a user\u2019s basal metabolic rate was calculated. Basal metabolic rate, or BMR, is essentially the number of calories you burn every day simply existing. It\u2019s calculated based on factors like your age, weight, sex, and height. If you put in the wrong data, you\u2019re going to get the wrong calorie burn....</p>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23449515/google-pixel-watch-fitbit-calorie-burn-wearable\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23449935/nasa-jpss-2-polar-satellite-earth-launch", "title": "Why NASA is launching a new polar satellite", "date_published": "2022-11-09 21:24:45+00:00", "description": "<figure>\n      <img alt=\"A white conical rocket fairing sitting on a wheeled transport.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SPsi34CczPH4xOMRYiLvjaGarJE=/0x0:1842x1228/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71607220/jpss2_for_advisory.0.jpeg\" />\n        <figcaption><em>The United Launch Alliance Atlas V payload fairing containing the Joint Polar Satellite System-2 (JPSS-2) at Vandenberg Space Force Base ahead of launch.</em> | Image: NASA</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"TtHth0\">This Thursday, a new Earth observation satellite will launch into space, where it will help scientists forecast the weather and keep an eye on increasingly common extreme weather events.
