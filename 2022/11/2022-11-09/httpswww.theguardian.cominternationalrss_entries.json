If the withdrawal does indeed lead to the swift recapture of the city, the Ukrainians will have done so with relatively little loss of life and without what could have been costly urban warfare.<br /><br />From the moment the Russian advance was stopped south of Mykolaiv in the spring, the invaders\u2019 position on the west bank was obviously strategically vulnerable. But it has taken a careful three-month campaign to force the Kremlin to conclude it cannot hang on, beginning with the targeting of Russian logistics on both sides of the river with Himars and other longer range rocket artillery and which turned to targeting strategic bridges and then the pontoons that the Russians had to built to resupply their forces in the cross-river pocket.<br /><br />An immediate question is whether Ukraine will now encounter unexpected resistance as it tries to push south, but with the reconnaissance drone technology it has available it should be able to detect if there are any substantial remaining forces. Serious battles appear unlikely \u2013 although Ukrainian troops will have to be wary of mines left by the retreating invaders. Russia has been preparing its exit for a month now, moving command and control across the river and at least some of its experienced forces, before finally evacuating any sympathetic citizens and the bones of Catherine the Great\u2019s chief minister Grigory Potemkin.<br /><br />But Ukraine will want to disrupt the Russian retreat as much as possible, capturing soldiers and above all equipment \u2013 turning the withdrawal into something like the near rout that took place in September when Russia made a similar decision, to withdraw from near Kharkiv and Izium in the northern part of the front to behind the Oskill river, in an attempt, only partially successful, to consolidate its position into the late autumn and early winter.</p><p>Of critical importance will be for Ukraine to secure the Nova Kakhovka dam, upstream from Kherson. Russian officials and military bloggers still repeat the implausible threat that Ukraine intends to destroy the 30-metre high dam, a hydro electric facility that Kyiv warns has been mined by the Russians. It is Russia that could gain most from destroying the dam, although it would likely be a war crime, further affecting Ukraine\u2019s already battered energy supplies, and widening the vast river at what is currently a relatively narrow point \u2013 although it could come at the cost of disrupting Crimea\u2019s water supply.<br /><br />Russia\u2019s strategy is clearly to try and consolidate its territorial gains as it seeks to bring more of the 300,000 conscripts forward to stabilise the front lines, and turn the barrier of the Dnipro in its favour. That, though, is likely to turn attention to other parts of the front line, such as the front south east of Zaporizhzhia, which has been stable for months. The attraction for the Ukrainians is that attacking here could cut off the land bridge to Crimea.<br /><br />For now, though, Russia remains in control of a large swathe of contiguous occupied territory. But what Ukraine has consistently shown all throughout the autumn is that its military are able to respond flexibly and creatively as the war continues \u2013 think also of the recent daring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/29/russia-suspends-ukraine-grain-deal-after-attack-on-sevastopol-naval-base\">drone raid on Sevastopol naval base</a>. It was an approach signalled by Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak in August, where he said Kyiv\u2019s ambition was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/creating-chaos-zelenskiys-adviser-outlines-ukraines-military-strategy\">to create \u201cchaos within Russian forces\u201d</a> by striking at Russia\u2019s supply lines as the attack on Kherson was only gearing up.<br /><br />Now, Ukraine\u2019s apparent victory could not be more timely as Americans and Europeans worry about high energy costs ultimately caused by the war. The challenge for Kyiv will be to repeat it against Russians who are desperately trying to dig in.<br /><br /></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/09/as-russia-tries-to-dig-in-ukraines-challenge-will-be-to-repeat-its-victory-in-kherson\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/09/what-happened-on-the-third-day-of-cop27-in-egypt", "title": "What happened on the third day of Cop27 in Egypt?", "date_published": "2022-11-09 18:48:33+00:00", "description": "<p>Negotiations move behind closed doors and China confirms \u2018informal\u2019 talks with US</p><p>After the leaders\u2019 speeches of the first couple of days, most of the negotiations have now moved behind closed doors.

It\u2019s hard to pin down exactly what story his final edit is telling, not surprisingly given its convoluted journey to the screen. Idea #1, Fellows explained at a Q&amp;A in London on Tuesday, was to film his effort to drive to Orkney in a dinky G-Wiz electric car. That idea was shelved when Fellows twigged to the logistical difficulties, but also when his 82-year-old father offered to join him on the trip. At which point, Father Earth became a buddy movie about a depressive comic and his dad trying to get a dream off the ground in the windswept wilds of northern Scotland.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/nov/09/graham-fellows-john-shuttleworth-father-earth-documentary\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/09/england-not-given-easy-ride-rugby-league-world-cup-shaun-wane", "title": "Wane insists England have not had easy ride in Rugby League World Cup", "date_published": "2022-11-09 16:47:55+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>England preparing to face Samoa in semi-final on Saturday</li><li>Wane: \u2018I don\u2019t see that, the World Cup have done a great job\u2019</li></ul><p>The England head coach, Shaun Wane, has laughed off suggestions that this year\u2019s Rugby League World Cup has been geared in favour of the hosts.

Suffice to say, in 2021 he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, had a 12.5-hour operation on his 14<sup>th</sup> birthday to remove half of his upper jaw, and then went through eight months of intensive chemotherapy. For most of a year, he spent more time in the hospital than out. If he wasn\u2019t being monitored for chemo drugs, he was being treated for their side-effects: the nausea, the fainting, the headaches, the nosebleeds that wouldn\u2019t stop. \u201cWe don\u2019t give this course of chemo to adults,\u201d said the oncologist. To my raised eyebrows, she answered: \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be able to take it.\u201d</p><p>Covid meant that only his dad and I were allowed, one at a time, on the cancer ward. It was a surreal world of blue curtains, masked nurses and endlessly beeping machines. During my 10-hour shifts, I tried to encourage edifying activities such as French practice or reading, but most of the time my son and I either slept or watched crap television. The hospital didn\u2019t have the internet, so we overdosed on episodes of Dinner Date, Taskmaster and reality renovation shows. When my son was well enough, we laughed at everything, pretending to ignore the tall bags of neon-yellow chemo-poison draining into the tube in his chest. I tried to keep his (and my) spirits up by planning what we would do after his treatment was over \u2013 a horse trek in Iceland, a gig at Wembley. Each week, we counted off the chemotherapy remaining: \u201cOnly 18 more weeks to go\u201d; \u201cWe\u2019re halfway through\u201d; \u201cWe\u2019ve completed the doxorubicin and cisplatin, now there\u2019s only the methotrexate to get through.\u201d When things got bad, I promised him: \u201cOne day this will be over.

Different characters wisecrack: \u201cIs that black enough for you?\u201d, riffing subversively on authenticity in the power struggle.</p><p>With a dense and fascinating mass of clips and interviews with figures in the movies such as Whoopi Goldberg, Zendaya, Samuel L Jackson and Laurence Fishburne, Mitchell fights back against cultural erasure and amnesia: there is a rich and vivid history of African American cinema which blossomed in Hollywood\u2019s pioneering golden age, but was siloed in designated \u201cnegro\u201d cinemas. (Martin Luther King is shown reminiscing about them.)
