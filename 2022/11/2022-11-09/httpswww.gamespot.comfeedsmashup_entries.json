These are smaller maps with a lot of action, especially Shipment, which is one of Call of Duty's smallest maps.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-season-1-overview-new-maps-battle-pass-raid-and-more/1100-6509035/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-2-0-info-third-person-modes-new-gulag-and-more/1100-6509034/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Call Of Duty: Warzone 2.0 Info: Third-Person Modes, New Gulag, And More", "date_published": "2022-11-09 18:00:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Ahead of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20/\">Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0</a>'s release next week, Activision has shared more details about the next iteration of its popular battle royale game.

Warzone 2.0 also includes a new \"experience\" called DMZ. This is an open-world, narrative-focused extraction mode where players fight alone or together with the aim of getting to the chopper to escape. On their way, players will take part in \"faction-based\" missions and side objectives, as they fight against other human and AI players before exfiltration at the end of the round.</p><p>Also in Warzone 2.0 are custom loadouts, which allow players to quickly access their loadouts from the traditional multiplayer mode.

From relaxing games to high-octane pixel platformers, there was a little something for everyone. And if you're just so itching for something new to play that you can't wait to get your hands on some great games, good news: Some of them are out right now. RIP your wallet.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As an Indie World presentation, this was focused strictly on third-party games--and more narrowly, on third-party games made by independent teams. So we didn't hear anything about Nintendo's own first-party releases like the long-MIA Advance Wars, imminent releases like Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, or 2023 Nintendo games like Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom--though we did receive a <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-trailer-has-it-all-tera-raids-special-events-and-ed-sheeran/1100-6508992/\">fresh new Pokemon trailer</a> in advance of the Indie World presentation.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The independent focus makes these games an eclectic mix of cultural influences and perspectives, from south Indian cooking to Japanese folklore. There are a few bigger indies in the bunch too, like a Switch port of the critically acclaimed Inscryption, and Sports Story, the sequel to the acclaimed Golf Story. Read on for a full wrap-up of everything shown at the Nintendo Indie World presentation.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sports Story</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4060702-3617962-switch-sportsstory_03.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">After an absence so long that it was <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sports-story-steven-petites-most-anticipated-game-/1100-6472405/\">one of our most anticipated games of 2020</a>, Sports Story made its triumphant return as the big finish in the Indie World presentation. This sequel to the acclaimed Golf Story takes the next logical step by blowing it out to include a ton of other sports and other activities. The new trailer showed off a dizzying number of sports you can play. You start out with only a few sports like golf, but before long you'll raise your sporting rank to unlock more sports including BMX biking, volleyball, cricket, and more.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Of course, this isn't just a sports story. You'll also visit the mall and go on RPG-like quests, explore dungeons and wastelands, encounter a pirate riding a train, and other wacky misadventures. Sports Story is also closer than you might think, as the presentation also announced that it's coming out in December.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Rogue Legacy 2</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4060701-3649945-euoadgvwaaavyre.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The anticipated follow-up to the roguelite action-platformer released on PC earlier this year, and now it's coming to Switch. And by now we mean right now, it's out, so go get it. The Switch release includes the Fabled Heroes update that packs new subclasses and items, so you'll get the full Rogue Legacy 2 experience right out of the box. For more, check out GameSpot's <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rogue-legacy-2-review-grand-lineage/1900-6417870/\">Rogue Legacy 2 review</a>, which gave it a stellar 9/10.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>A Little to the Left</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4060722-ss_426ce5e9200a5773912727d49bfcf725a46dfa55_jpg.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">In the \"chill vibes\" category we have A Little to the Left, a relaxing game that almost ended the presentation. A Little to the Left is a sorting game that focuses on tidying up, complete with extremely satisfying clicks and clacks as things fit just into place. It's basically <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/\">r/oddlysatisfying</a> as a series of minigames. The twist is the presence of a cat, inspired by the developers' real-life pet, who occasionally pops up to mess up your perfect organization. But who can stay mad at such a lovable fluffball? A Little to the Left is available today.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Venba</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4060723-ss_630f125c7a2779eb742d043bd9a9cc8e749e8c9c_jpg.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We got a fresh look at Venba, the narrative cooking game about an Indian woman who immigrates to Canada. While there, she restores lost family recipes by cooking authentic south Indian dishes. It looks like a tasty time, and it's coming in Spring 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Goodbye World</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4060724-ss_a149f8db8f07a8f652555ba259b664cf8fcfe199_jpg.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Take a step inside a game development studio with this adventure game following a fledgling pair of indie devs making their own retro-inspired puzzle platformer. This trailer showed off the two layers of the game, including the narrative adventure elements and how the game-inside-a-game comes together on a Game Boy-like device. Goodbye World will release later this month.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Have a Nice Death</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4060725-ss_088ff2f7aab89779e2c91745c2c92ca4afd2e739_jpg.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The humorously gothic action game Have a Nice Death is coming to Nintendo Switch, and a flashy new trailer showed tons of quick slice-and-dice combat alongside animated clips of our heroic little grim reaper. The game will be available on March 22, 2023, but preorders begin today.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Aka</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4060726-ss_683c8cab8cda724aa58b180ae1be529fcb200280_jpg.png\" /><br /><h3><p>This chill game from film veterans takes place in a small open world, where a retired red panda warrior seeks to find inner peace on an island. You can build a shelter, feed baby dragons, go on quests, and face the (very literal) ghosts of your past when it launches on December 15.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Pepper Grinder</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4060823-peppergrinder.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">This Devolver Digital joint features Pepper, a little girl with a big drill, as she burrows her way through pixel platforming stages to collect treasure and defeat enemies. It's coming in 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus &amp; Butterfly</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4060727-ss_17b84d9630a8655cde8afe4186402800d7716859_jpg.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Good news, Coffee Talk fans. Another round of the barista narrative adventure game is coming. This trailer showed off some of the new characters you'll encounter, like an opera-singing banshee and an orc game developer. It's coming in spring 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Oni: Road to be the Mightiest Oni</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4060728-ss_cd91d2a6476cffd061feba84ad12ae6af9d5ff81_jpg.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Who hasn't wanted to be an adorable little demon?

You can set out to be the mightiest Oni on March 9, 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Desta: The Memories Between</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4060729-ss_32fa48b648ee5de9aead235f28fe484dd506d8a6_jpg.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">This character-driven roguelite features a full voice cast, as you delve into your dreams to play a turn-based strategic ball game with the colorful cast of characters. The studio behind Monument Valley brings this surreal sport to life. It's coming in 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>A Space for the Unbound</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4060734-ss_abe74cd1b9c037df7413a61aa18833021b4ebcf4_jpg.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">This slice-of-life RPG takes place in rural Indonesia in the 1990s, with a romantic undercurrent mixed with supernatural abilities. Two lovebirds search their town to discover secrets as a looming threat hangs over the world. It's coming January 19, 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dordogne</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4060735-ss_925b3f7562a7ee7938388ca6669b662e4d1737bc_jpg.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Summer can be a magical time for a child, and this painterly game tries to recapture that spirit through the eyes of an adult.

It's coming in Spring 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Botany Manor</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4060825-screenshot2022-11-09at12.16.04pm.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">As a retired botanist with a grand manor to take care of, you care for plants, plant new seeds, solve puzzles and find clues to learn about yourself and your plants. Botany Manor is coming in 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Once Upon a Jester</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4060736-ss_0dc5d9ebcb9515527d788d24ee98fce4b22bff07_jpg.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Once Upon a Jester is an adventure game centered around improvisation, with quirky writing and voice acting. You're a band of thieves attempting to steal a royal diamond, but the whole scheme relies on getting an invitation to join the Royal Theatrical Spectacle. You'll have to bluff your way through challenges against other performing troupes to earn your way into the competition. You won't have to wait long to brush off your acting chops, as it's available right now.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Blanc</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4060740-ss_9edcf9e1e0c0c0ac15e913d72fccb2029f59c9e6_jpg.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We got a new look at this co-op adventure featuring an unlikely friendship between a wolf cub and a fawn.

It happens without fail, a new slew of TV shows are canceled, some beloved, others less so. Some shows go away without getting a proper ending to their story, while others get a planned conclusion that won't leave us hanging. Once upon a time, it was surprising to see streaming service giant Netflix adding shows to the list, but those days have come and gone.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Now, Netflix cancels a decently long list of shows practically every year. While many of them didn't get past the first season or two, there are also long-running shows that meet their end because, well, TV shows simply can't go on forever. After all, the kids on Stranger Things aren't exactly kids anymore. How much longer could Netflix have realistically expected to see them run around Hawkins chasing monsters?</p><p>With that in mind, we're taking a look at every show Netflix has canceled this year. Thankfully, we're getting the satisfaction of some of these shows playing out in full (and they may not even technically end this year, depending on how release schedules play out). Others, though, are simply gone too soon. After you've made it through this list, make sure to check out our recap of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-26-tv-shows-canceled-in-2022-so-far/2900-3928/\">every show canceled across the network and streaming landscape this year</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1.
