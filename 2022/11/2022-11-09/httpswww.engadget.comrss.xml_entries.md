<p>FTX won’t be rescued by its biggest rival. One day after announcing a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/binance-buys-ftx-crypto-exchange-183519035.html"><ins>proposed deal to buy the cryptocurrency exchange</ins></a>, Binance said it didn’t like what it found in the company’s books. “As a result of corporate due diligence, as well as the latest news reports regarding mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations, we have decided that we will not pursue the potential acquisition of FTX,” Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1590449161069268992?s=20&amp;t=GfRmrqe-g0u5FjWhppv6dA"><ins>tweeted on Wednesday afternoon</ins></a>. “Our hope was to be able to support FTX’s customers to provide liquidity, but the issues are beyond our control or ability to help.”</p><div id="089d96d8f2f04e72bbfb0ed34dfd0f5d"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">As a result of corporate due diligence, as well as the latest news reports regarding mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations, we have decided that we will not pursue the potential acquisition of <a href="https://t.co/FQ3MIG381f">https://t.co/FQ3MIG381f</a>.</p>— Binance (@binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1590449161069268992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>The abandoned takeover bid caps off a tumultuous week for FTX. On November 2nd, <em>Coinbase</em><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/"><ins>published</ins></a> a report that revealed that the cryptocurrency exchange was facing a liquidity crisis. In response to the article, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao announced that the company would sell about $529 million worth of FTX’s FTT token, a move that wiped out the value of the cryptocurrency and launched a public spat between the competing exchanges.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Even when the acquisition was first announced, the likelihood of it moving forward seemed uncertain at best, with Zhao stressing at the time that the deal was non-binding. “This is a highly dynamic situation, and we are assessing the situation in real time. Binance has the discretion to pull out from the deal at any time.” he said on Tuesday. By the following morning, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-is-said-to-be-likely-to-walk-away-from-deal-to-buy-ftx-11668020963?page=1"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/09/binance-is-strongly-leaning-toward-scrapping-ftx-rescue-takeover-after-first-glance-at-books-source/"><em><ins>Coinbase</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>came out with separate reports claiming Binance was strongly leaning toward abandoning the rescue.</p><p>Less than an hour later, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-09/us-probes-ftx-empire-over-handling-of-client-funds-and-lending?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-09/us-probes-ftx-empire-over-handling-of-client-funds-and-lending?sref=10lNAhZ9"><ins>investigating FTX</ins></a> to determine if the company had mishandled customer funds.

<p>If you use an iPhone and a Windows PC, syncing photos is about to get a lot easier. The feature Microsoft announced last month that adds <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-icloud-photo-library-in-windows-141746258.html"><ins>iCloud Photos to the Windows Photos app</ins></a> begins rolling out today. Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2022/11/09/windows-11-makes-it-easier-to-connect-to-your-icloud-photos-right-in-the-photos-app/"><ins>says</ins></a> it will be available to all Windows 11 users by the end of November.</p><p>Previously, if iPhone users wanted to transfer images to their Windows PCs, they had to either plug in their iPhone with a USB cable or use the iCloud web app in a browser – a dated and clunky setup, though the site is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-icloud-web-beta-194116973.html"><ins>undergoing some much-needed changes</ins></a> soon. Microsoft’s new feature gives you an integrated view of all your iCloud photos through the Windows 11 Photos app.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To use the new feature, you’ll need to ensure your Windows Photos app is up-to-date. Then, you’ll need to install the iCloud for Windows app from the Windows Store, sign in, and choose to sync your photos.</p><p>iCloud Photos integration is part of Microsoft’s broader initiative to make its software the “most open,” removing friction points between rival services. For example, the Windows maker launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-app-xbox-series-x-series-s-one-134451547.html"><ins>Apple Music on Xbox consoles</ins></a> last month, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-music-apps-windows-162815595.html"><ins>Apple TV and Music apps</ins></a> are coming to Windows 11 next year.

## Elon Musk tells Twitter advertisers that 'content is actually improving, not getting worse'

<p>Elon Musk is trying, once again, to sell his vision of Twitter’s future to the company’s advertisers. Musk, who by all accounts has yet to address Twitter’s remaining staff as a group, joined an hour-long “town hall” to take questions from advertisers and share more about his plans for the platform.</p><p>The company’s advertising business has taken a significant hit in recent days as a number of major brands have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-losing-advertisers-boycott-193748977.html"><ins>pulled back</ins></a> from the platform and activists have called for a boycott. Musk said last week that these actions had caused a “massive drop in revenue” for Twitter.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In his talk on Twitter Spaces, Musk tried again to reassure advertisers that their brands would be safe on the platform. He said that ads appearing next to hate speech “isn’t great” and pitched the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-blue-now-available-190106760.html"><ins> newly launched</ins></a> Twitter Blue as a way to decrease hate speech on the platform. Under the new Twitter Blue, brands will need to pay for the blue check like all other accounts, Musk said. He added that anyone impersonating a brand would be permanently banned from the service.</p><p>He also said that he hopes to make Twitter ads a lot more relevant, and wants to integrate ads into recommended tweets. The goal, he said, was to “drive sales in the short term and protect the demand in the long term.”</p><p>Notably, he struck a much different tone than in recent tweets when <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1588676939463946241"><ins>he threatened</ins></a> “a thermonuclear name and shame” for advertisers boycotting the platform. “I understand if people kind of want to give it a minute and see how things are evolving,” he said. “We've been more rigorous about clamping down on bad content and bots and trolls, not less. So my observation of Twitter over the past few weeks is that the content is actually improving, not getting worse.” He added that brands and advertisers should be more active on the platform and that if they see something they don’t like they should “reply to one of my tweets and I’ll do my best to respond.”</p><p>Musk also talked more about his philosophy on content moderation, though he didn’t share any concrete changes to Twitter’s policies or how its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-moderation-council-elon-musk-193142274.html"><ins>moderation council</ins></a> might function. "We have to be, I think, tolerant of views we don't agree with, but those views don't need to be amplified," he said.</p><p>He also stated that he has plans to make Community Notes, the crowd-sourced fact checking feature that used to be known <a href="http://engadget.com/twitter-birdwatch-fact-checks-expansion-190037862.html"><ins>as Birdwatch</ins></a>, a more central part of the platform. “This is really gonna help in improving the accuracy of what's said in the system.” He also suggested that Community Notes would have an impact on the visibility of content on Twitter. “It's analogous to the way sort of Page Rank works in Google, where the the prominence of a webpage is proportionate to how much weight other prominent web pages give that web page. I think it’s a game changer.”</p>

## Kia's 2023 EV6 will cost $7,100 more than its predecessor

<p>Kia has <a href="https://www.kiamedia.com/us/en/media/pressreleases/19638/kia-america-announces-2023-ev6-pricing">unveiled</a> pricing for the 2023 EV6, and it's decidedly more expensive than before — although you might not mind depending on what you were looking for. The new electric crossover starts at $49,795 when you include the $1,295 destination fee, or $7,100 more than the entry 2022 model. You do get more in the bargain, though. The automaker has dropped the cut-down Light trim with 232 miles of range and now starts with the Wind RWD variant, which delivers a claimed 310 miles. That could put the EV6 out of reach for some buyers, but is also an acknowledgment that Light ultimately existed to upsell customers to pricier versions.</p><p>Wind now costs $1,000 more than it did last year. You may not have much need to spend extra, at least, when that configuration includes a power liftgate, vehicle-to-device power ports, Meridian audio and ventilated leather seats. You also have the option of a tech package previously limited to the Wind AWD with blind spot and surround views, parking collision avoidance and a remote start parking aid.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other trims mainly provide added performance and intelligence. The $52,400 Wind AWD adds its namesake 320HP dual motor system with 282 miles of range. Spend $52,700 on the GT-Line RWD ($57,400 for AWD) and you'll get extras like navigation-based smart cruise control, more advanced highway driving assists and lane following help. And it's now clear just how much you'll pay for the range-topping <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kia-goes-full-beast-mode-with-the-new-576-hp-ev6-gt-155033633.html">EV6 GT</a> — the performance-oriented car starts at $61,400 with a 576HP motor system, electronically-guided suspension, a limited-slip rear differential, higher-end brakes and 21-inch wheels mated to Goodyear Eagle F1 tires. Kia claims the GT can reach 60MPH in 3.4 seconds, so this is your pick if you want to shame sports cars at the local drag strip (and don't mind the reduced 206-mile range).</p><p>You still have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-ioniq-first-drive-180018819.html">the Ioniq 5</a> if you want Hyundai's latest EV tech in a (slightly) more affordable package. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kias-2023-niro-suv-comes-in-all-the-ev-flavors-141024897.html">Niro EV</a> is an option, too. However, it's evident the automaker is repositioning the EV6 as a more premium machine.</p>

<p>So much for a smooth rollout of Twitter's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-official-verified-checkmark-154546497.html">"official" verification badges</a>. Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1590383366213611522">claims</a> he "just killed" the deployment hours after it began. The gray checkmarks have vanished from those accounts that only just got them, including Engadget's and <em>The New York Times</em>. With that said, this isn't necessarily a complete about-face. Twitter VP Esther Crawford <a href="https://twitter.com/esthercrawford/status/1590388608359628800">clarified</a> that you'll still see the marks, but that the social media giant is handing them out to "government and commercial entities" at first. The focus just isn't on individuals, the executive said.</p><p>In justifying the move, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1590383539610324992">reiterated</a> his view that tying the original checkmark <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-verification-twitter-blue-161532924.html">to a Twitter Blue subscription</a> will democratize the service. The blue check is the "great leveler," he said. Crawford, meanwhile, <a href="https://twitter.com/esthercrawford/status/1590386711179464705">stressed</a> that there were no more "sacred cows" and that Musk was willing to try things that might fail. The company is willing to reverse course if feature changes don't pan out, to put it differently.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="2decb76c980d458cb502a77724c0917e"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I just killed it</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1590383366213611522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>The statements add to the confusion beyond the "official" label launch. While they indicate that Twitter will concentrate on a narrower group of accounts, it's now uncertain just when celebrities and other public figures might get (or rather, reclaim) verification. This also creates uncertainty around Twitter's feature updates — Musk may axe or limit an update even while it's reaching customers.</p><p>It will take some time before it's clear just who gets what checkmarks, and what vetting will be necessary to get the "official" tag. For now, the only safe assumption is that Twitter will tie its original tick to an $8 per month Blue subscription.</p>

<p>Gaming keyboards are plentiful and diverse right now. You can buy them in black or white, wired or wireless, and with at least a dozen key switch options. And every year they’ve gotten bigger and more complex, with media buttons and macro keys and bright rainbow LED lighting. However, this past year has seen some manufacturers go in the opposite direction, introducing 60 percent keyboards that are cute and compact.

The most common one is the full-size deck, which will usually have somewhere between 100 and 110 keys, depending on whether the manufacturer includes media buttons or macro keys. There’s always a function row located along the top of the keyboard, and a number pad on the far right. Most gamers will prefer a full-size model rather than a compact keyboard because it lets them perform many  different functions with just one press, and set up macros for activities that aren’t already built-in to the keyboard.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tenkeyless decks have been pretty common for a while now; those are keyboards that omit the number pad on the right. That’s it. They still have function keys and media controls, but they’re narrower since they omit 17 keys. Yeah, it’s actually more than 10 keys but “seventeenkeyless” doesn’t have the same ring to it. Gamers might opt for one of these when they need a little more space on their desk, and they don’t need a quick way to enter numbers or do calculations (which is my number one use case for the right-hand pad).</p><p>Then there are 60 percent keyboards which, as the name indicates, cut out 40 percent of the standard keyboard size and only have 61 keys. Not only do they just remove the number pad, but the function keys are gone, along with the arrow keys and those weird system keys like “print screen” and “home” that are only useful when you happen to need them. On some computers they don’t even work.</p><p>On a 60 percent keyboard you’ll access these buttons by using the function key; there’s no standard layout between companies so you’ll have to learn new hotkeys if you switch between manufacturers like Razer, HyperX or Corsair. They also lack built-in wrist rests, though the height is at least adjustable.</p><p>Razer also just introduced a 65 percent keyboard, a less common configuration which keeps the arrow keys and some functions but still tosses the rest to maintain a reduced profile. This is probably a preferred option if you use the arrow keys a lot. I need them because I edit a lot of text, and some games may use them instead of the standard WASD array for controlling your character.</p><h2>What are the benefits of a 60 percent keyboard?</h2><figure><img alt="60-percent keyboards on a bed of colored paper" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/b2aeb850-be53-11eb-abdf-50ff2f0f3988" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>With so many functions removed, why buy a 60 percent keyboard? The number one reason to use a compact keyboard is space of course. If you’re gaming in tight spaces or just have a lot of crap on your desk like I do, not having to shove stuff aside just to make some elbow room is nice. It’s especially helpful if you tend to eat near your computer, as a 60 percent keyboard’s small size makes it easy to push out of the way to rest a plate or bowl on your desk. It actually keeps the keyboard a lot cleaner, too, since I can easily shake crumbs out of it with one hand.</p><p>A smaller keyboard size also makes it more portable, obviously, with a 60 percent keyboard taking up less space than a laptop in your bag, though it’s still a little thick. They do have lower-profile keys than standard decks at least, though if thickness is your number one concern then carrying around a mechanical keyboard is probably not for you.</p><p>One big feature that doesn’t get talked about a lot is that all of the recent 60 (and 65) percent decks are not wireless keyboards and use detachable USB-C cords. So if you switch between workspaces often, you can easily leave a cord at each desk to quickly plug in your keyboard. As someone who tests a lot of keyboards I’ve found this handy because I can switch out the deck and leave the cord intact. It’s often a real pain to have to unplug cords and untangle them from my office setup every time I try a new keyboard, but for the 60 percent models I’ve been using the same wire for all of them.</p><h2>The best for most gamers: Razer Huntsman Mini</h2><p></p><p>The best of the major 60 percent keyboards out there right now is the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9SYXplci1IdW50c21hbi1NaW5pLUdhbWluZy1LZXlib2FyZC9kcC9CMDhCM0pTS0dSP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTN6LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNDA4NmZlMC0yNDE3LTRjM2QtYjljZS05OWQ2ODBkYjhhMzQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWWG-TGnhSyk7GPaGqgjmFyZbbX4L13NGQ4kwIBNxy0s&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRazer-Huntsman-Mini-Gaming-Keyboard%2Fdp%2FB08B3JSKGR%3F">Huntsman Mini</a>. It uses Razer’s opto-mechanical switches, which I haven’t been too fond of in the past, but the company seems to have made some changes that make it a much more pleasant typing experience. This gaming keyboard is quiet and smooth with good response time, though people who prefer a springy key feel should look elsewhere. It’s not a wireless keyboard, so if you take it on the go you’ll need to make sure you always have a USB-C cord handy. The Huntsman Mini gaming keyboard also comes in white, which means it’ll blend into your decor more than most gaming accessories, especially if you choose to customize the LED lighting.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Attractive; good typing feel; comes in white.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> No wireless; not everyone will be a fan of opto-mechanical keys.</p><h2>Runner up: HyperX Alloy Origins 60</h2><p></p><p>If you need a solid, sturdy brick of a 60 percent keyboard, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9IeXBlclgtQWxsb3ktT3JpZ2lucy1NZWNoYW5pY2FsLUNvbXBhdGlibGUvZHAvQjA4WEJRNzlNTj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0zei0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTQwODZmZTAtMjQxNy00YzNkLWI5Y2UtOTlkNjgwZGI4YTM0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAchQygphEv8ZvcG_rVoTqgg5VrIrOr64ZNdZaJtSdy4H&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHyperX-Alloy-Origins-Mechanical-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB08XBQ79MN%3F">HyperX Alloy Origins 60</a> is a mechanical deck on a metal baseboard. It’s heavier than the other options on the market, so it might not be the best if you’re aiming to keep your travel bag as light as possible. But if you’re a particularly rough typist this is the one that will put up with hard keystrokes the best. It also earns points for being the one 60 percent keyboard that puts the secondary arrow functions at the bottom right of the deck where you’d normally look for those, instead of tucking them away in the middle.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Solidly built; cheaper than other 60 percent options; well-placed arrow keys.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Heavy; no wireless.</p><h2>The best with arrow keys: Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed</h2><p></p><p>Razer’s BlackWidow line has long been a favorite of the gamers here at Engadget, and the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDkzNUhXTDFaP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTN6LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNDA4NmZlMC0yNDE3LTRjM2QtYjljZS05OWQ2ODBkYjhhMzQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaSRr73v4rlDAg_JTA10veFVUrbD7lYBFGyu9dQ9hBxo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0935HWL1Z%3F">V3 Mini</a> is no exception. Unlike the other keyboards on this list it’s a 65 percent keyboard, which means it still has arrow keys and a column of miscellaneous keys on the right side that can double as macro buttons. There are two switch options available to suit different typing preferences, either clicky and tactile (green) or linear and silent (yellow). It’s worth noting that the latter description is the company’s term for it, and the V3 Mini’s typing is still noticeably audible to those around you.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Two types of key switches available; has both 2.4G and Bluetooth wireless; includes keys other keyboards don’t have.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive; the lip at the bottom is bulky.</p><h2>A cheaper but underwhelming option: Corsair K65 RGB Mini</h2><p></p><p>Corsair usually makes pretty great keyboards, but I couldn’t necessarily say that of the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Db3JzYWlyLUN1c3RvbWl6YWJsZS1CYWNrbGlnaHRpbmctS2V5c3dpdGNoZXMtSHlwZXItUHJvY2Vzc2luZy9kcC9CMDhXMkNTWExNP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTN6LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNDA4NmZlMC0yNDE3LTRjM2QtYjljZS05OWQ2ODBkYjhhMzQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQaBQBrac9GcaZAGN3NTsHHUA1Iszx0swDTz23WHJ1p-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCorsair-Customizable-Backlighting-Keyswitches-Hyper-Processing%2Fdp%2FB08W2CSXLM">K65 RGB Mini</a>, its entry into the 60 percent market. The materials were substandard for the company, with a plastic casing that felt hollow and keys that made a ringing noise when hit. But it’s not a completely terrible accessory, and users already invested in Corsair’s iCUE software might want to keep their accessories streamlined under one customization suite instead of having to bounce between different interfaces. If that isn’t a concern for you, the HyperX Alloy Origin 60 is both better and cheaper.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Uses Corsair’s iCUE software; key feel is good.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Cheap materials; noisy typing experience; no wireless.</p><p></p>

## Modders thought it would be fun to make a folding iPhone

<p>You don't have wait for Apple to see what a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-could-be-planning-to-launch-a-foldable-i-phone-by-2023-085255232.html">foldable iPhone</a> would look like in practice. China-based The Aesthetics of Science and Technology (AST) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1DxL-vyjfs">claims</a> to have built a folding iPhone through heavy modifications. The engineers say they created the one-off with spare <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-14-motorola-razr-review-2020-foldable-fashion-statement.html">Motorola RAZR</a> parts, their own 3D-printed elements and an iPhone X screen made more flexible by replacing the not-at-all-foldable glass and touch layers. An iOS jailbreak lets Apple's software run on the handset and introduces suitable features like a split-screen mode.</p><p>The result is largely what you'd expect — it looks like the love child of an iPhone and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review-camera-samples-specs-price-battery-life-170027529.html">Galaxy Z Flip</a>, with all the compromises that come with an unofficial design. While the folding iPhone appears to work as advertised, there's a cavernous gap when it's folded. There's a smaller battery, no wireless charging and just one speaker. As you'd guess, the design also loses water resistance and any kind of real-world durability. The modded iOS also clearly isn't as optimized for flexible displays as Samsung's software for the Galaxy Z series.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="aebcb3928a2a4918a084e47c4a702934"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>This effort might also warrant some skepticism. <em>Gizmodo</em> notes that the team glosses over some important steps, including the need to rearrange key internals. While there aren't obvious signs that something's amiss, the initiative isn't definitive proof that a do-it-yourself folding iPhone is possible. It's certainly a greater challenge than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-usb-c-i-phone-becomes-a-reality-thanks-to-a-robotics-engineer-113556672.html">adding a USB-C port</a>.</p><p>Rumors have suggested that Apple may introduce an honest-to-goodness folding iPhone as soon as 2023, making this hacked-together handset more of a (very rough) preview than a desirable item in itself. Just wait long enough and you may get a far better product. The mod illustrates Apple's challenges, at least. A proper foldable iPhone would require major engineering changes and software tweaks to meet users' expectations. There are also problems that even brands like Motorola and Samsung have yet to overcome, such as displays that crease and (in some cases) crack.</p>

## Google One's VPN comes to Mac and Windows

<p>You no longer need to pull out your phone to use <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-one-vpn-191231627.html">Google One's virtual private network</a>. Google has <a href="https://one.google.com/about/vpn">released</a> One VPN apps for Mac and Windows systems. As on mobile, the VPN encrypts and otherwise masks your internet traffic. You can't use it to access content from other regions like you can with some VPNs, but it should help if you're worried about exposing your IP address (potentially useful for tracking) or using a public hotspot.</p><p>The VPN requires at least the $10 per month 2TB Google One plan, although you can share access with up to five other people. Desktop support is available in all 22 countries where the service is available, including the US, Canada, Mexico, UK and much of Europe. You'll need at least macOS Big Sur or Windows 10. There is a caveat — while the Mac app works for both x86 and ARM users, the Windows app doesn't support 32-bit or ARM-based systems. You'll have to look elsewhere if you're hoping to secure your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-pro-9-5g-review-sq3-arm-173012304.html">ARM-powered Surface Pro</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As before, Google has independent bodies audit its VPN. It also shares the source code for its app libraries to ensure transparency. The audit for the desktop apps will be made public in the "coming weeks."</p><p>The desktop apps are arguably overdue when many <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-vpn-services-130028530.html">VPN providers</a> have long supported multiple platforms.  This isn't necessarily the best option, depending on your needs. Mozilla's VPN includes regional server choices for $60 per year, and you can even get a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-20-opera-for-android-51-vpn.html">free Opera VPN</a> if you're only worried about protecting your browser activity. Google's advantage remains the bundle — you're really buying cloud storage that happens to include a VPN among its benefits.</p>

<p>If you've ever bought a game on <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/stadia">Stadia</a>, Google's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-shutting-down-stadia-162704135.html">soon-to-be-defunct cloud gaming service</a>, it's worth keeping an eye on your bank balance and credit card statements. As of today, Google is starting to process refunds for Stadia purchases. The first wave of refunds will include those for purchases of games, add-on content and subscriptions made through the Stadia store. However, the company is not refunding Stadia Pro subscription fees.&nbsp;</p><p>Google says it will process the refunds automatically. It expects to issue most of them (including those for hardware purchases) by the time it shuts down the Stadia servers on January 18th. "We ask for your patience as we work through each transaction and ask that you refrain from contacting Customer Support as they will not be able to expedite your refund during this time," the company wrote in <a href="https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/12790109">an updated support article</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If Google can't issue a refund automatically to your original form of payment, it will email you via the Google account through which you made your purchase(s). Folks who have deleted their Google account and no longer have access to the original form of payment may have to get in touch with Stadia's customer support team.&nbsp;</p><p>If you've made 20 or fewer Stadia store transactions on your account, you'll get one email for each successful refund, which will likely prove a bit annoying. If you've bought 21 or more games or addons, you'll get one email summarizing all the successful refunds.</p><p>Elsewhere in the updated FAQ, Google notes that players will be able to transfer their save data from Stadia to other platforms in some cases, but it's up to developers and publishers to support that. Ubisoft, <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyBulletn/status/1575558847250411521"><ins>Bungie</ins></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/IOInteractive/status/1575818132492636162"><ins>I/O Interactive</ins></a>, CD Projekt Red, <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsColourTV/status/1582853316727275522"><ins>Rockstar Games</ins></a> and <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/10/20/elder-scrolls-online-stadia/"><ins>Bethesda</ins></a> are working on ways to help players move their game progress to other platforms. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Cyberpunk%202077/"><em><ins>Cyberpunk 2077</ins></em></a> players can already <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/stadia/sp-technical/issue/1709/where-are-my-game-saves-located-1"><ins>export their save data</ins></a> to the PC version and sync it to consoles. Meanwhile, Ubisoft has said it will offer players who bought its products on Stadia <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stadia-shut-down-google-ubisoft-connect-pc-gaming-184117918.html"><ins>PC versions of those games</ins></a> on top of the refunds they'll get from Google (though you'll of course need a powerful enough rig to run them).</p><p>Elsewhere, there was a disappointing update for those hoping that Google will unlock the Bluetooth functions on the Stadia Controller so it can more easily be used on other platforms. For now, the company hasn't committed to doing so. It says you'll still be able to use the peripheral by connecting it to another device via USB-A or USB-C.</p>

<p>Don Lewis, a pioneer in the worlds of synthesizers and electronic music, died on Sunday at the age of 81. In the 1970s, Lewis created the Live Electronic Orchestra. The system enabled him to control multiple synthesizers and other instruments simultaneously using custom keyboards, around a decade before <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/midi"><ins>MIDI</ins></a> became a standard.</p><p>Lewis worked on some well-known mainstream synths as well. He collaborated with Roland founder Ikutarô Kakehashi on the company's drum machines. Among those was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roland-marks-tr-808-40th-anniversary-213021007.html"><ins>the TR-808</ins></a>, which is perhaps the most important drum machine of all time. Lewis also designed sounds for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-24-relive-yamahas-synth-history.html"><ins>Yamaha DX7</ins></a>, along with Hammond and ARP instruments, as <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/don-lewis-electronic-music-pioneer-dies-at-81/"><em><ins>Pitchfork</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>notes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As a performer, Lewis took to the stage at venerated venues such as the Sydney Opera House, Carnegie Hall and the Apollo Theater. He collaborated with big-name artists including Quincy Jones, Michael Jackson and the Beach Boys.</p><p>While Lewis may not have been a household name, his contributions to electronic music are critical and undeniable. For those keen to learn more about Lewis' life and career, you may be interested in checking out a documentary called <em>Don Lewis and the Live Electric Orchestra</em>. The film will air on PBS in February<em>.</em></p><div id="8a310331bb154eeab1d026e16827a93c"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p>

## Twitter starts rolling out its 'official' checkmarks to celebrities and publishers

<p>You didn't have to wait long to see Twitter's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-verification-official-label-003134650.html">reworked verification system</a> in action. <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23449122/twitter-official-verified-gray-checkmark-verification">reports</a> that the social network has begun adding its subtle "official" checkmarks to major accounts, including those of celebrities, large publishers and politicians. This includes <a href="https://twitter.com/engadget">Engadget</a>, <em>The Verge</em> and general publications like <em>The New York Times</em>. Curiously, though, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-elon-musk-bought-and-took-over-twitter-180045278.html">new Twitter owner</a> Elon Musk doesn't have the mark yet — you'd think he'd adopt it quickly given the many impersonators who use his name to pitch crypto scams.</p><p>VP Esther Crawford previously stressed that the "official" badge won't be available for purchase, unlike the blue checkmarks that will come with an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-price-increasing-8-per-month-180319987.html">$8 Twitter Blue subscription</a>. Those that previously received blue ticks won't necessarily get the second label, however. It's not yet certain if those seeking the extra mark will need to go through further vetting.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The complete rollout should be relatively quick. Twitter has been testing the "official" checkmarks for a while, and previously said the deployment should wrap up in the coming days.</p><p>To some extent, this feature is fixing a problem Twitter created for itself. Musk and others have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-verification-twitter-blue-161532924.html">blasted the previous approach</a> to verification as an unfair "lords and peasants" system that disenfranchised ordinary users while enshrining a selected elite. While that's true, the old method also established authenticity — the changes to Blue effectively break verification by letting determined fraudsters pay to get a checkmark next to their name, even if that carries the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-says-twitter-will-permanently-ban-users-that-impersonate-accounts-093024671.html">risk of a permanent ban</a>. The "official" mark brings back that trust, although it asks Twitter to once again decide who's deserving of special recognition.</p>

That’s because simply twisting its lid removes oxygen from the canister, slowing down potential oxidation which can cause tea to taste dull and lifeless. It’s available in three sizes (0.4, 0.7 and 1.2 liters) and in a range of materials, though you’ll probably want to stay away from the glass version, as light is another source of potential oxidation. (Leave the clear one for cookies or something.) And while it’s a bit on the pricey side, in my opinion there’s no better way of keeping even the fanciest leaves tasting great over time.</p><a class="athena-button rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwN1BZNFdYWFYvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTN5LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2ZjZmOTQzNy05ZGQ3LTQ4ZTYtOGNhMy0wMDlhNzE3M2MzYzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeIz_LwShL9HexuZp67q_mM_ft8Z9PWR12uCv-F5g-YU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07PY4WXXV%2F" id="294d36935bd948e8b92d9c10c117e82d">Buy Fellow Atmos canister at Amazon - $35</a><h2>Golde Superwhisk</h2><figure><img alt="Golde Superwhisk" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/a2a2db50-548c-11ed-b7f7-a125142777c9" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>For matcha lovers who don’t want to deal with the hassle of a traditional bamboo whisk or anyone seeking a way to quickly froth up some milk, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=914aca18-04a0-4640-827b-3861a783ed0d&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Goldeco&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5MTRhY2ExOC0wNGEwLTQ2NDAtODI3Yi0zODYxYTc4M2VkMGQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9nb2xkZS5jby9wcm9kdWN0cy9zdXBlcndoaXNrPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNmY2Zjk0MzctOWRkNy00OGU2LThjYTMtMDA5YTcxNzNjM2MwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZ3xWdco0SPK08MJQzdroE-JLlNa8gcHO3-XR9StCrwq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fgolde.co%2Fproducts%2Fsuperwhisk%3F">Golde’s Superwhisk</a> is a great pick.

And because butterfly pea flower doesn’t contain caffeine, between its color and taste, it’s a great way to introduce kids to tea.

## NASA delays Artemis 1 launch by two more days to November 16th

The current two-hour launch window opens at 1:04AM ET. There's a backup launch opportunity scheduled for November 19th.</p><p>The latest delay is due to the threat posed by Tropical Storm Nicole. The new launch window is dependent on conditions being safe enough for NASA employees to return to work, as well as inspections after the weather system has passed.

<p>In a few short hours, Nintendo will stream its latest Indie World Showcase. <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1589633781853552643?s=20&amp;t=Zas_TF1FHW9BJNqdRlk-sg">Announced on November 7th</a>, the company promised approximately 25 minutes worth of information about upcoming indie games that are coming to the Nintendo Switch. You can watch the entire event unfold on the gaming giant’s <a href="https://t.co/hDrAmAABvI">website</a>, as well as its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyQrcFyO_jY&amp;ab_channel=NintendoofAmerica">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nintendo">Twitch</a> channels. If you miss the livestream, don’t worry: we’ll have you covered with coverage of the major announcements from the event.</p><p>What will Nintendo announce Iduring Indie World? One can always hope for a more definitive release date for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. Based on Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass-171852706.html">recent announcement</a> that the game would be available on Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass on its release date, some have speculated that <em>Silksong </em>would arrive before June 2023. That said, Nintendo is more likely to share updates about games like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oxenfree-2-delayed-2023-164908520.html"><em>Oxenfree II Lost Signals</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metal-slug-tactics-delayed-195926656.html"><em>Metal Slug Tactics</em></a>.

## Serif's Affinity V2 apps includes a full creative suite for the iPad
 - [https://www.engadget.com/affinity-version-2-suite-150051754.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/affinity-version-2-suite-150051754.html?src=rss)

<p>Serif is determined to make its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/affinity-designer-photo-publisher-sale-141501927.html">Affinity suite</a> a more practical alternative for creatives who'd rather not pay for an Adobe subscription — or use a conventional PC, for that matter. The developer has <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/press/newsroom/affinity-v2-sets-new-standards-in-creative-software/">released</a> Affinity Version 2 apps that not only include major new features (more on those shortly), but the first edition of Publisher for the iPad. You now have all of the Affinity bundle on your tablet, and won't have to split your attention between your computer and iPad when it's time to design a page layout.</p><p>Regardless of platform, you should see some meaningful upgrades. Affinity Photo 2 now includes non-destructive RAW development, saved layer states, compound masks (that is, joining multiple masks together), live warping and live masks for elements like hue and luminosity ranges. Affinity Designer 2, meanwhile, adds non-destructive vector warping, a "knife" cutting tool, a shape builder and even tools for measuring lengths and areas. Affinity Publisher 2 now helps you add academia-friendly footnotes, endnotes and sidenotes. You can also create automatically repeating layouts and use a style picker. There's even a way to stitch multiple documents into a single book, although that's only available in desktop versions for now.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d581833180454ce8bbb70604f1433233"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Some improvements are iPad-specific. A new radial menu provides access to common keyboard modifiers like Command and Option, while a quick menu offers clipboard options and nine customizable shortcuts. And if you're feeling the limits of your tablet screen, a compact mode keeps the brush and layer panels open while making more room for the image you're editing.</p><p>The one-time price may be more of a draw than before. You'd normally pay $170 for the entire Affinity suite across all platforms, but a launch sale drops that price <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/affinity-pricing/">to $100</a>. That makes it relatively affordable compared to Adobe's Creative Cloud, which will keep you paying indefinitely. You can buy the individual Affinity Version 2 apps for $70 on the desktop ($41 on sale) and $20 (currently $12) on the iPad.</p><p>This outlay might not thrill you if you recently bought Affinity V1. You may likewise need to consider rivals like Adobe if you need further apps for animation, web design and other aspects of the creative pipeline. If these tools fit your workflow, though, the price is low enough that they should be reasonably easy to justify.</p>

It's also less bulky than a smartwatch, which is nice for workouts, and the new touchscreen is bright and clear. The Charge 5 also has GPS to record your runs and hikes and Fitbit Pay so you can leave your wallet at home. In the end, we called it one of your best options for a GPS-enabled tracker.

## Volvo officially reveals the EX90 EV SUV, its 'safest car ever'

<p>Volvo took another step towards its 2030 goal of full electrification on Wednesday with the official unveiling of its new flagship, the all-electric EX90. The three-row, seven-seat SUV, which grew out of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-concept-recharge-ev-152846008.html">Concept Recharge</a> design, will go on sale alongside its gas-powered sibling, the XC90, in model year 2024.</p><p>The EX90 will initially come equipped with a 111 kWh battery pack powering a pair of permanent magnet electric motors for 380 kW (517 hp) and 910 Nm of AWD torque. Per the company, the pack can refill from 10 to 80 percent in under 30 minutes. Volvo has not yet shared performance figures for the vehicle.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The EX90 will be the first Volvo to offer bi-directional charging capabilities, which enable drivers to use their vehicles as home-scale batteries in the event of power outages — similar to what <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-striking-ioniq-5-delivers-long-range-and-brisk-performance-093212320.html">Hyundai's Ioniq 5</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-bidirectional-ev-charging-f-150-lightning-180545326.html">Ford F-150 Lightning</a> offer. Volvo plans on selling home charging equipment as well including a wall box and energy management system. What's more the EX90 — like the rest of its EV brethren — will enjoy over-the-air software updates, though <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-launches-over-the-air-software-updates-for-all-its-vehicles-101506506.html">Volvo has begun expanding that service</a> out to hybrid and ICE models as well.&nbsp;</p><p>The EX90's exterior is optimized for aerodynamics, boasting a drag coefficient of .29, just a touch behind the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html">VW ID.4</a> and very respectable for a full-size SUV, electric or not. "We’ve taken inspiration from yacht design to outline the Volvo EX90’s beautiful and sleek proportions,” Volvo's head of design, T. Jon Mayer, said in a press release. “If you look at the front, it’s proud and confident – inspired by a sailboat’s ability to shear through the ocean’s slamming waves. But it’s also rounder overall, which enables the air to flow around the car more efficiently.”</p><p>Pedestrians will sail around the car more efficiently as well, thanks to the "shield of safety" that Volvo is working on. Using a mix of LiDAR, optical, ultrasonic and radar sensors, the EX90 will offer a 360 degree view around itself to  proactively react to other vehicles and pedestrians even if the driver doesn't immediately notice the issue. The EX90's LiDAR sensors can reportedly spot pedestrians up to 250 meters away. <a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/304018/the-upcoming-volvo-ex90-helps-to-keep-you-safe-through-understanding">The company believes that the system</a> could reduce the rate of all accidents by 9 percent and cut accidents resulting in serious injury or death by as much as 20 percent.&nbsp;</p><div id="510129754048498f9483959623817d1e"></div><p>"No matter how much experience you have or how much competence you have, at the end of the day, we are all still human," Volvo Head of Safety Jim Rowan quips in the walkthrough above. "We want to help people become better drivers by being there when they're not at their very best." The company plans to further incorporate the LiDAR sensors into its future unsupervised autonomous driving system.</p><p>But like the oozing garbage bags one finds on the side of the highway, it's what's inside that counts. The EX90's cabin provides a well-lit Scandinavian minimalist design clad in sustainable and recycled materials, such as "<a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/us/en-us/media/pressreleases/305099/inside-the-all-new-volvo-ex90-reinterpreting-luxury-and-well-being">Nordico</a>," a fabric made from recycled PET bottles "as well as bio-attributed material from responsibly-managed forests in Sweden and Finland. All of the interior wood panels are FSC-certified sustainable and if you opt for the wool seat fabric, that yarn will come from vetted suppliers "according to strict sustainability standards on animal welfare, environmental and social issues." In all, more than 50 kilograms of recycled plastic are used in each EX90 interior.</p><p>“We’ve put a lot of effort into the illumination inside the EX90, trying to create a warm interior and a somewhat colder expression for the exterior,” Mayer noted. “It’s also connected to how people in Scandinavia might be perceived. There’s a calm and understated confidence that can read as cold at first – but once you get to know people, you find that they're really warm.”</p><p>The EX90's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-has-developed-the-worlds-first-interior-radar-system-for-cars-130538248.html">in-cabin LiDAR is a world-first</a>, designed to detect the presence of occupants and alert the driver if anyone is left behind in an effort to prevent hot car deaths — Volvo notes that more than 900 kids have died in these circumstances in the US since 1998. Where allowed by regulation, the system will prevent the keyfob from locking the doors should a child or pet be detected inside and display a warning icon on the central infotainment screen.</p><p>"No one chooses to be distracted or tired, but we know it can happen," Lotta Jakobsson, Volvo senior technical specialist in injury prevention. "We’re all human and distraction is a fact of life. With the help of cutting-edge technology, we’ll support you when you’re not at your best and help you avoid leaving family members or pets behind by accident."</p><p><em>Developing...</em></p>

<p>Last year’s holiday season was plagued by supply chain issues, while this coming season is looking a little brighter. We’re getting out, seeing friends and family and enjoying all the new hobbies we’ve picked up over the past two years – and that includes your kids, who’ve probably gained a few new interests. If those interests tend toward science and tech (and we don’t just mean video games), we’ve got some great ideas for you, sure to put a smile on the faces of kids of all ages, from the littles to those who are grown in body but still young at heart.</p><h2>Laugh &amp; Learn Game Controller</h2><figure><img alt="Fisher Price Laugh &amp; Learn Game Controller" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/7fa4fa10-591f-11ed-b4ff-feeefb74f664" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>New gamer parents probably can’t wait to get a controller in their kid’s hands, though maybe not a $70 DualShock 5 when the child is more likely to stick it in their mouth.

## IBM's latest quantum computing processor triples the qubits of its predecessor

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ibm/"><ins>IBM's</ins></a> latest quantum computing processor marks a notable step forward for its ambitions in the field. At the IBM Quantum Summit 2022, the company announced Osprey, which has the largest qubit count of any of its processors at 433 quantum bits. That's more than triple the number of cubits that the Eagle chip, which IBM <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ibm-eagle-processor-050133991.html"><ins>revealed last November</ins></a>, has. IBM said it built on top of the 127-cubit Eagle's architecture by keeping qubits on a single plane with the help of multi-level wiring.</p><p>"Unlike classical bits which have to be in a state of either one or zero, qubits can exist in a complex mix of both, tapping into the fundamental quantum nature of matter at subatomic levels," IBM said in a press release. "As a result, quantum computers offer the possibility of vastly increased computing power that can be used to tackle calculations of much greater complexity in fields such as artificial intelligence, and the design of new materials for drug discovery and energy research."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="A split view of IBM's Osprey quantum computing processor, showing the layers of the chip." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/d258d6d0-5ec1-11ed-afd7-cd3116102257" style="height: 1152; width: 2048;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Connie Zhou/IBM</div></figure><p>The company is scaling up its quantum computing efforts with the aim of building a system with 4000-plus qubits by 2025. It's currently on target <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/ibm-quantum-roadmap-2025"><ins>with its roadmap</ins></a>. Next up is a 1,121-cubit chip called Condor that IBM hopes to debut next year.</p><p>IBM <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-08-ibm-q-system-one-quantum-computer.html"><ins>debuted</ins></a> an elegantly designed functional quantum computer at CES 2019. Last year, it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0glxDw700g"><ins>offered a sneak preview</ins></a> of the design for the next-gen IBM Quantum System Two (the machine that will use its quantum processors). Now, the company has revealed more details. It designed the system to be flexible and modular with the ability to house multiple architectures and processors, and claims it will include Osprey starting next year. The company claimed the System Two design "allows for an exponential step up in quantum computing scale and enabling the vision of quantum-centric supercomputing."</p><p>Having immense computational power at one's fingertips doesn't mean much if you don't have the right software to get the most out of it. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ibm-quantum-computing-speedup-050134678.html"><ins>Early last year</ins></a>, IBM said that its Qiskit program execution environment was able to blend quantum and conventional computers to carry out complex computations in hours, when they previously would have taken months. The company said it will offer new features to mitigate and suppress errors, and provide "a fast, efficient and easy-to-use programming model for quantum computers." What's more, these features blend into IBM's goal of integrating quantum computers with classical computers, including supercomputers.</p>

## The Morning After: Tesla recalls 40,000 cars with broken power steering

<p>Less than two months after it admitted a million vehicles had faulty window sensors, Tesla is issuing another large-scale recall. This time, the company is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-power-steering-recall-model-s-model-x-164544014.html"><ins>flagging more than 40,000 cars</ins></a> after a software defect cut power steering when driving over potholes. A software fix is rolling out, and Tesla said over 97 percent of affected vehicles already have the new code.</p><p>This is, however, the 17th recall Tesla has issued in 2022, with issues affecting more than 3.4 million vehicles. It adds weight to Tesla’s critics, too, who say the company’s poor build quality hurts its ability to recruit would-be EV buyers. But despite the number of post-purchase issues, the company hasn’t seen any harm to its bottom line, which saw profits double in the last year.</p><p>– Dan Cooper</p><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoom-email-calendar-meetings-productivity-184822470.html"><ins>Zoom is adding email and calendar features to take on other workspace platforms</ins></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/mediatek-dimensity-9200-phone-soc-080033338.html"><ins>MediaTek's latest Dimensity chip supports WiFi 7 and ray tracing</ins></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/lgs-latest-display-can-be-stretched-by-20-percent-092041123.html"><ins>LG's latest display can stretch by 20 percent</ins></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-ps5-162534113.html"><ins>'God of War: Ragnarok' is bigger but not massively better </ins></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gifts-for-coffee-lovers-130018731.html"><ins>The best gifts for coffee lovers in 2022</ins></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-and-renault-extend-partnership-with-a-software-defined-vehicle-111539198.html"><ins>Google and Renault are developing a 'software-defined vehicle' together</ins></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/gopro-hero-11-black-deal-50-off-with-one-year-gopro-subscription-182527726.html"><ins>GoPro's Hero 11 Black is now $50 off with a one-year subscription</ins></a></p></li></ul><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/binance-buys-ftx-crypto-exchange-183519035.html"><ins>Crypto giant Binance is buying its rival FTX following a very public dispute</ins></a></h2><h3>FTX was once valued at $32 billion.</h3><p></p><p>One of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges has been bailed out by one of its major rivals.

<p>LumaFusion, a well-regarded video editing app for iPhones, iPads and Macs, is finally making its way to Android and Chrome OS devices. Shortly after it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-app-store-awards-2021-among-us-myst-league-of-legends-080131192.html">won best iPad app of the year</a> in 2021, thanks to its ability to make complex video editing easy to do using just one's fingers, LumaFusion made its Android debut on Samsung's Galaxy Tab S8 devices. According to <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/lumafusion-android-chromeos-early-access/"><em>Android Police</em></a>, its developer, LumaTouch, promised to put it up for download on the Galaxy Store back then while also working on a release for the Chrome OS. It took some time to make that happen, but now LumaTouch is rolling out an early access version of the app to the Google Play Store and the Samsung Galaxy Store.</p><p>The features iOS users enjoy are expected to be on the Android and Chrome OS releases, as well. LumaFusion lets users lay down up to 12 tracks, six of which can be videos, which they can link and unlink. They can use preset transitions or create their own, import media from various sources or edit directly from USB drives, as well as pick from a library of royalty-free music, sound effects, videos and backgrounds. <em>AP</em> says LumaTouch formed a team of Chrome OS developers to make this release happen, so the app has likely been optimized for the platform instead of being a subpar iOS port.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>LumaFusion typically costs $30, but users will be able to purchase it from the Galaxy Store and Play Store for $20 within its early access period. The listing for either platform isn't up yet, from what we can see, but it'll most likely pop up soon enough.&nbsp;</p><div id="cd7adfbfe6f94c23abf77a57fef407ed"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p>

## New French law will require parking lots to install solar panels

<p>In 2020, France was the only EU nation <a href="https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/politique/solaire-et-eolien-comment-le-gouvernement-tente-de-rattraper-son-retard_2182801.html">not to meet</a> its obligations for the development of renewable energy, as it still relies primarily on nuclear power. Now, the French Senate has approved a bill that should increase that markedly, requiring parking lots with a minimum of 80 spaces to be covered by solar panels, according to <a href="https://www.publicsenat.fr/article/parlementaire/l-obligation-de-pose-de-panneaux-photovoltaiques-sur-les-grands-parkings"><em>Public Senat</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Parking lots with between 80-400 spaces will have five years starting in July 2023 to be in compliance. Any larger lots will have less time, only three years from the same date. In all cases, at least half the area of the parking lot must be covered with solar panels. The government says the plan, aimed primarily at parking lots off freeways and major routes, could generate up to 11 gigawatts — the equivalent of 10 nuclear reactors.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are some notable exceptions. When outdoor parking lots have"technical, safety, architectural, heritage and environmental constraints," they may be exempt. Lots shaded by trees over at least half their area may also escape the requirement, as will parking lots for trucks. Finally, when the installation of panels "cannot be met under economically acceptable conditions" (something that could cover a wide range of scenarios), they can also be excluded.</p><p>On top of the solar parking lots, the government is looking at building large solar farms on vacant land next to highways, railroad tracks and agricultural areas. National railway operator SNCF also plans to install <a href="https://www.ouest-france.fr/economie/transports/sncf/la-sncf-veut-installer-des-panneaux-solaires-dans-ses-gares-et-vendre-l-electricite-au-reseau-public-c2914230-93df-11ec-86db-c58c7e312fa9">over a million square meters</a> of solar panels by 2030, in an effort to reduce energy purchases by a quarter.</p><p>It's not clear how parking lot operators will pay for these installations, or how much financial aid the government will provide. Still, it looks like a good use of parking lots, as it will provide shade for cars and change what is usually an eyesore into a... more environmentally friendly eyesore.</p><p>Parking lots covered with solar panels are not yet that common, with one of the largest examples being the <a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202108/1231333.shtml">Belgium Zoo parking lot</a> pictured above. Its 7,000 parking spaces are 70 percent covered by 62,000 overhead solar panels that generate 20 megawatts of peak power — much more than is required for the zoo.&nbsp;</p><p>Early this year, President Emmanuel Macron <a href="https://www.elysee.fr/emmanuel-macron/2022/02/10/reprendre-en-main-notre-destin-energetique">set an objective</a> to increase of <a href="https://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/actualite-economique/l-energie-sans-carbone-l-espace-un-futur-champ-infini-de-panneaux-solaires_2154980.html">s</a>olar energy production tenfold to over 100GW and builds 50 offshore wind farms to add a further 40GW. France currently generates 25 percent of its electricity with renewables, less than its European neighbors. It has also seen delays on repairs to nuclear power plants, causing state electricity company EDF to reduce predicted output — exacerbating energy supply issues caused by the war in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After finally allowing posting last year, Instagram continues to make changes to its desktop web app. The latest update introduces a refresh user interface that takes better advantage of large screens rather than looking like a larger version of the mobile app, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/08/instagram-is-updating-its-web-interface-to-take-advantage-of-large-screens/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> has reported.&nbsp;</p><p>Instagram Chief Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CktWQMDKJmL/">announced</a> the update along with the new in-app scheduler <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-in-app-scheduler-055239620.html">revealed yesterday</a>. "We know a lot of people use the web to multitask and we wanted to make sure Instagram was an as great experience as possible online," he said in a video. "So it is cleaner, faster and easier to use and it’s designed now to take advantage of large-screen monitors."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Instagram on the web has been redesigned for large screens" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/bb5b4980-5ffd-11ed-b956-2677a85a289e" style="height: 1442; width: 2386;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>As shown above, the home, search, explore, messages and notification menus were moved to a new side rail that collapses to icons depending on screen size. Stories are shown at the top, while your profile, suggestions and more are off to the right. When selecting any menu option, the left menu bar remains, making navigation quicker and easier.&nbsp;</p><p>The new interface makes Instagram easier to use on web, but there's still no sign of a dedicated iPad app, as <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/11/08/instagram-web-gets-new-more-modern-interface-and-yet-no-ipad-app/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a> notes. Earlier this year, Mosseri said that iPad was "<a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-ipad-app-adam-mosseri-160717090.html">not big enough</a>" to make a dedicated Instagram app a priority. Now, at least, you could use the web version instead to get a better experience.</p>

## Disney now matches Netflix's subscriber numbers across its combined services

<p>Disney+ has welcomed 12.1 million new subscribers for the company's <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disneys-fiscal-full-year-and-q4-2022-earnings-results-webcast/">fourth fiscal quarter</a> ending on October 1st, and according to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-earnings-q4-fourth-quarter-results-164357146.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90cmVsbG8uY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAknfTQfApjr_I_IewV3D0m_JHls6gGwATsRR9WS5qJ6YV-o2SGn7BKTcjaqM3NBnG7XW3STXHgeA4Xi-2pOOZ5ChIY5Kc3lsvSZxM4FbsRGcOld3-NDaHRvcZC4qFHtX8p6UVNANNog6z8zT938-bOOZXkZNbitTn2ZDGTa29FH"><em>Yahoo Finance</em></a>, that's 3 million more than analyst estimates. In all, Walt Disney added 14.6 million subscriptions for Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, bringing its total number of streaming subscribers so far to around 236 million. While Disney+ alone with its 164 million subscribers have yet to reach Netflix numbers, all three of the company's services combined had amassed members that can rival the streaming giant's. Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-adds-2-41-million-subscribers-soaring-past-expectations/">revealed</a> that it has around 223.09 million subscribers during its latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-begin-charging-extra-user-fees-early-next-year-221450520.html">earnings report</a> in October.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the impressive growth in subscriber number, Disney's operating loss for streaming increased from $0.8 billion to $1.5 billion for the quarter. Disney+ experienced more losses within the period due to higher production and technology costs, as well as an increase in marketing expenses. There were also no Premier Access releases for the quarter, such as last year's <em>Black Widow</em> and <em>Jungle Cruise</em>. That said, the losses were offset in part by higher subscription costs, which will become even higher in December.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Walt Disney CEO Bob Chapek said that the company expects its streaming losses to narrow going forward, thanks to its price increases and the launch of an ad-supported tier on Disney+. The company even believes that Disney+ is on track to achieving profitability in the fiscal year of 2024, assuming the lack of a "meaningful shift in the economic climate." If you'll recall, Disney is raising its streaming prices across the board this December, and the ad-supported tier for Disney+ is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-price-increase-ad-based-service-204903273.html">launching on December 8th</a> for $11 a month.&nbsp;</p>

## Twitter's revamped verification scheme will have two checkmarks, and one isn't for sale

<p>It turns out Twitter’s new plan for verification will be a two-tiered system after all. Esther Crawford, the twitter VP leading the revamped Twitter Blue subscription confirmed that in addition to the blue checkmarks, the company will also use a separate <a href="https://twitter.com/esthercrawford/status/1590109344976470016">“official” label </a> for “select” accounts.</p><p>The label had previously been spotted on <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1588146115014189060"><ins>internal</ins></a> builds of Twitter, but it’s the first time anyone at the company has confirmed its existence. Twitter, which recently laid most of its communications staff, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to Crawford, the “official” label will be reserved for “government accounts, commercial companies, business partners, major media outlets, publishers and some public figures.” It’s unclear how Twitter will designate which accounts qualify or if they will have to go through an additional vetting process. “Not all previously verified accounts will get the ‘Official’ label and the label is not available for purchase,” Crawford tweeted.</p><div id="b45b191035a74d8b83d81566c307f5b6"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Not all previously verified accounts will get the “Official” label and the label is not available for purchase. Accounts that will receive it include government accounts, commercial companies, business partners, major media outlets, publishers and some public figures.</p>— Esther Crawford ✨ (@esthercrawford) <a href="https://twitter.com/esthercrawford/status/1590109380338647040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>The plan seems like it’s meant to address some of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-verification-twitter-blue-161532924.html"><ins>the criticism</ins></a> that’s been leveled at Musk’s plan for Twitter Blue and verification. Namely that paying for verification could open the door for scammers and impersonators to hijack conversations and spread misinformation. Crawford isn’t the first Twitter executive to address the issues. Yoel Roth, the company’s head of integrity, has <a href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel/status/1589804646834778113"><ins>also said</ins></a> twitter plans to “ramp up proactive review of Blue Verified accounts that show signs of impersonating another user.” Elon Musk also said that Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-says-twitter-will-permanently-ban-users-that-impersonate-accounts-093024671.html"><ins>would ban</ins></a> all impersonators without warning after a number of accounts changed their names to Elon Musk to make a point about his plans.</p><div id="4f69ab42388b4bedb1052aaeec32802a"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">For years, Verification on Twitter has been tricky because it’s a signal both of authenticity (you are who you say you are) and notability (you’re “important” by some standard). <br /><br />Notability is inherently difficult to determine in a fair way globally. I support getting rid of it.</p>— Yoel Roth (@yoyoel) <a href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel/status/1589804650416738304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>Of course, the new “official” labels also sound a bit like… Twitter’s existing verification system which Musk and others have criticized as unfair. And, the fact that it will only be given out to “select” accounts determined by Twitter, sounds like the company will once again be making a judgment about which accounts are “notable,” something Twitter execs — including Roth — have criticized.</p><p>The “official” label and the expanded verification are both expected to roll out in the coming days.</p>
