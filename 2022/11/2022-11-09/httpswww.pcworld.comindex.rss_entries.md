<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Black Friday is almost upon us, and with it comes a plethora of deals on computer monitor. While Amazon already has some great monitors on sale, we suggest also checking out Walmart and Best Buy. And don&rsquo;t forget about HP and Lenovo, because their online retail stores sell more than just PCs. </p>



<p>Searching for the right monitor can be a daunting task, but rest assured, we&rsquo;re highlighting only deals that offer great tech at legitimate discounts. We&rsquo;ve also included an FAQ section, which addresses the best times to shop on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, plus some advice on what to look for in a good monitor.</p>



<h2 id="early-black-friday-gaming-monitor-deals">Early Black Friday gaming monitor deals</h2>



<p>When it comes to fast-paced PC gaming, every second counts. That&rsquo;s why you should consider getting a proper gaming monitor, as they&rsquo;re designed to make your game look as smooth as possible when the action is furiously fast. We can highly recommend the deals below. </p>

The refresh rate is how fast a monitor can draw up a new image. 360Hz is incredibly fast, so visuals on this monitor should look quite smooth.</p>



<h2 id="early-black-friday-4k-workstation-monitor-deals">Early Black Friday 4K workstation monitor deals</h2>



<p>4K monitors are great for content creation thanks to their high resolutions and larger screens. Although they&rsquo;re a good choice for editors who need to see the finer details of their work, there&rsquo;s really nothing like watching an epic movie on a 4K display too. So, whether you&rsquo;re a video editor or a movie buff, we&rsquo;ve got quite a few options below.</p>

<p>Black Friday is on Friday, Nov 25th 2022. If you consider yourself an avid deals hunter, we&rsquo;d suggest going online in the early hours to take advantage of the best deals. Deals tend to change and expire at a breakneck pace.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Amazon&rsquo;s going to have a slew of awesome deals. That&rsquo;s a given. However, for monitors, you should definitely peruse the main pages of HP, Dell and Lenovo. Personally, I find myself going directly to the manufacturers more often than not. You can also widen your net and scope out other online retailers like Best Buy and Newegg. </p>

<h3 id="what-should-i-look-for-in-a-monitor">What should I look for in a monitor?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Ah, we&rsquo;ve arrived at the question of the hour. </p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s first talk about refresh rate, which is important if you&rsquo;re looking for a gaming monitor. The refresh rate is how fast a monitor can redraw the image on its screen. The faster the refresh rate, the smoother your visuals will look. For competitive first-person shooters, we&rsquo;d recommend 120Hz as the minimum rate. Anything higher is good enough for the eSports realm.</p>



<p>Resolution is another important feature to consider. Much like the refresh rate, the higher the number, the better. We&rsquo;re talking about the quality of images and video here. 1080p is the bare minimum for most monitors. However, if you&rsquo;re a video editor, bumping the resolution up to 4K makes a massive difference, as it allows you to see more detail. </p>



<p>The final thing is the screen size. 27 inches is the most common and a good size for a home office. For gaming monitors, 24 or 27 inches is best. Sometimes a larger screen causes eye strain and if you&rsquo;re going to be staring at one for hours, it&rsquo;s better to go a bit smaller. For 4K monitors, 32-inches is a good option, as it gives you quite a bit of screen to work with. </p>

## Black Friday TV deals: What to expect and early sales

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Black Friday TV deals typically begin in early November, then crescendo on Thanksgiving and Black Friday itself. And don&rsquo;t think of waiting until the last minute, either&mdash;you can always buy the TV you&rsquo;d like now, and then return it if you find a better TV deal afterwards.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re curating the best TV deals leading up to Black Friday with several things in mind. First, retailers can offer discounts, <em>then</em> raise prices, and <em>then</em> lower them again to accurately (though disingenuously) say they&rsquo;re offering a Black Friday discount. So, we&rsquo;re keeping an eye out for legitimate price drops, not pricing tomfoolery. </p>



<p>Second, we&rsquo;re aiming to highlight great deals on truly good TVs, even if the model may be a year or two old. Bottom line: Our goal is to help you score the best value for your dollar.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve compared TVs across major retailers, looking to find both solid discounts as well as good prices on quality tech. We don&rsquo;t list all of the specifications here, but we&rsquo;ll explain some of our reasoning below.</p>

Regarding the LG OLED deal atop our list, we consider an OLED TV a premium purchase, and a 48-inch OLED will work well for a bedroom or den. Sony&rsquo;s deal on its 4K 65-inch model offers a nice size, a Google TV interface, and full-array LED display for improved contrast (though image quality won&rsquo;t be as good as the LG OLED). </p>



<p>The 75-inch Samsung model is a massive, quality TV at at a good price. The Vizio TV we&rsquo;ve highlighted isn&rsquo;t particularly bright, but with minimal input lag it&rsquo;s good for gaming&mdash;as is the Sony, for that matter, with some PlayStation-specific features like minimal lag, too.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re pretty sure that the TCL deal at Walmart is sold out near you, but you might give it a click to check. That&rsquo;s a very cheap price for a very large 55-inch 4K TV.</p>

<p>Size matters. Most people probably want to buy a 50-inch TV or larger for their living room or family room. We encourage you to review TechHive&rsquo;s straightforward explanation of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techhive.com/article/600006/tv-tech-terms-demystified-part-one-screen-size-resolution-and-speed.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1374506-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed">what TV sizes matter</a>, TV <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techhive.com/article/2999888/tv-tech-terms-demystified-part-two-display-types-and-technologies.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1374506-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed">display types and display technologies</a>, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techhive.com/article/3051792/tv-tech-terms-demystified-part-four-led-backl&amp;xcust=2-1-1374506-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed">LCD backlighting tech</a>.</p>



<p>The short answer, though, is to buy the biggest TV that you feel comfortable with. Second, focus on backlighting. Most TVs use LEDs, but more advanced TVs use QLED or miniLED, and the <em>very</em> best models use OLED display tech. Most eyes can notice the improvements offered by OLED TVs, notably inky blacks and more vibrant, richer colors. Also look for HDR (High Dynamic Range), a technology that further improves color richness and brightness, giving you more of a movie-like experience.</p>



<p>Finally, you&rsquo;ll want to pay attention to smart features that connect your TV to a streaming video interface, either via a Roku interface or Google/Android TV. Each platform allows you quick access to streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, etc. It really depends on your preference, and whether you want to avoid using, say, the additional remote of an Apple TV box.</p>



<p>You do <em>not</em> need the latest technology, and our picks represent what we consider to be the best value, without asking you to pay several hundred dollars for incremental improvements.</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>It&rsquo;s important to be smart about your choices when buying a sub-$500 laptop, since, realistically, you will need to make some compromises. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t still get a great laptop on a budget. And believe it or not, there are actually upsides to less-expensive laptops&mdash;their low-powered processors mean you can expect good battery life, and Chromebooks are often less vulnerable to malware. </p>



<p>Within this budget range, Windows machines with Intel Core i3 or i5 processors or entry-level Chromebooks are the way to go. We have tested numerous inexpensive laptops and each one has its pros and cons, but those that stood out are included in this list. If you&rsquo;re looking for something other than the standard clamshell design, we&rsquo;ve included our favorite inexpensive tablet with a detachable keyboard as well as a convertible with a gorgeous OLED display.</p>

<p>With its affordable price point, decent performance, and robust build, the Acer Aspire 5 is an excellent sub-$500 option. The Intel Core i5 processor keeps things relatively zippy, and performance is fast enough for general-use tasks like writing emails and browsing the web. </p>

<p>The 14-inch LCD 1080p display is reasonably sharp and vibrant, which is great for working on documents or streaming video. This machine also comes with 8GB of RAM, which is plenty for quickly firing up applications. The keyboard is rather nice, too.</p>

<p>In our review, the tester was pleasantly surprised by the keyboard&rsquo;s &ldquo;durable feel.&rdquo; It has a spacious layout, which is perfect for longer typing sessions. Although the keyboard lacks backlighting (not surprising given the price) and the touchpad is a bit difficult to use, we feel the pros far outweigh the cons here. </p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re shopping around for a solid everyday laptop that won&rsquo;t break the bank, the Aspire 5 is definitely worth a look.    </p>

<p>Between its reasonable price and superb keyboard, the Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 is nice all-arounder. Thanks to the Intel Pentium Gold 7505 processor, this Chromebook is equipped to handle web browsing, editing documents, and other simple tasks. However, according to our review, it can &ldquo;feel taxed by demanding tasks.&rdquo; For example when the tester opened up multiple tabs, he noticed some lag in performance. </p>

<p>The port selection is a nice combination of old and new: It has two USB-C ports, a single USB-A port, a 3.5mm combo audio jack, and a microSD card reader. The 13.3-inch 1080p IPS touchscreen is a big perk at this price point, too. </p>

<p>Regarding the keyboard, our tester liked the &ldquo;crisp and taut&rdquo; feel of the keys. It&rsquo;s fairly comfortable, making it suitable for marathon typing sessions. Although this laptop is a 2-in-1&mdash;meaning the screen can fold back to make it function more like a tablet&mdash;it weighs just about 3 pounds, which is on the heavier side for a convertible. </p>

<p>It may not be the most portable laptop in the world, but that flexibility can still be nice for applications that favor a tablet form factor. Overall, the Flex 5 has a lot going for it.</p>

<p>Yes, another Chromebook&mdash;but the HP Chromebook x2 11 is one of the best 2-in-1 machines you can buy, considering its cheap price. While some may find the detachable-keyboard design a pain to deal with, our reviewer really liked this one. The tablet&rsquo;s aluminum chassis feels rugged and like it&rsquo;ll last quite a while. The detachable keyboard took some getting used to, but ended up being fine for long typing sessions. </p>

<p>The rear plate, which transforms into a kickstand that holds up the tablet for hands-free use, connects to the back of the tablet via magnets. The reviewer found the connection to be both clean and strong. As for the performance, it&rsquo;s about what you&rsquo;d expect out of a Chromebook: zippy enough for everyday tasks like browsing the web and so on.</p>

<p>The x2 11 is powered by a Snapdragon 7c processor, which is better than the MediaTek chips you&rsquo;ll find in most Chromebooks. That said, the Intel Core i3 in Windows machines is simply more powerful by default. This HP also packs 8GB of RAM, which helps with web browser performance, among other tasks. </p>

<p>The 11-inch 1440p touchscreen is on the smaller side, but that just means it&rsquo;s lighter and more portable than bigger display options. Plus, the 1440p resolution is truly beautiful. According to the tester, colors were rich and shadows were quite dark.</p>

<p>The Lenovo IdeaPad Chromebook Duet 5, a Chrome OS tablet that doubles as a laptop, has a solid keyboard and drop-dead gorgeous 1080p OLED display that produces colorful images. Although the screen&rsquo;s 16:9 aspect ratio might feel awkward for some, it would be perfect for watching movies. </p>

<p>Lenovo&rsquo;s keys have a decent travel distance of 1.3mm and the detachable keyboard as a whole doesn&rsquo;t feel too cramped. There&rsquo;s also a kickstand that can be adjusted up to 135 degrees. The one tradeoff is that the USI-compatible pen costs extra. </p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a peek under the hood. For starters, this Chromebook is armed with a Snapdragon SC7180 processor. Again, it&rsquo;s more powerful than the MediaTek chips. When it comes to opening up applications and web pages, the 8GB of memory offers a nice boost in speed. </p>

<p>There&rsquo;s 128GB of storage, but that&rsquo;s not majorly important, as you&rsquo;ll store most things in the cloud. But the star of the show here is the 1080p OLED panel, which makes every little pixel really pop. If you&rsquo;re after a gorgeous OLED screen with amazing contrast and color, the Duet 5 will hit the spot. </p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>



<p>The PCWorld team puts each and every Windows laptop through a series of benchmarks that test GPU and CPU performance, battery life, and so on. The idea is to push the laptop to its limits and then compare it against others we&rsquo;ve tested. </p>



<p>Chromebooks, on the other hand, go through a series of web-based tests. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair or possible to run the same kinds of tests on a Chromebook, as they&rsquo;re Chrome OS-based machines. Below, you&rsquo;ll find a breakdown of each test and the reasons why we run them.</p>



<h3 id="windows-laptops">Windows laptops</h3>



<ul><li><strong>PCMark 10</strong>: PCMark 10 is how we determine how well the laptop handles lighter tasks like web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, and so on.</li><li><strong>HandBrake</strong>: HandBrake is more intensive than PCMark 10. It basically measures how long a laptop&rsquo;s CPU takes to encode a beefy 30GB file. </li><li><strong>Cinebench</strong>: Cinebench is a brief stress test of the CPU cores. It does this by rendering a 2D scene over a short period of time.</li><li><strong>3DMark</strong>: 3DMark checks if 3D performance remains consistent over time by running graphic-intensive clips. </li><li><strong>Video rundown test</strong>: To gauge battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 10&rsquo;s Movies &amp; TV app until the laptop dies.</li></ul><h3 id="chromebooks">Chromebooks</h3>

<p>Ah, here we are at the billion dollar question. Do you spring for a basic Chromebook or go for a Windows laptop with more features? Well, it really depends on your lifestyle and your expectations of a sub-$500 machine. At this price point, you&rsquo;re not going to find a powerful workhorse. However, there are plenty of affordable laptops out there for those who need the basics. </p>



<p>Chromebooks, for example, are a great low-cost option and offer phenomenal battery life. I use a Chromebook as my primary work laptop, as it has everything I need for both editing and writing. If you travel for work, it&rsquo;s probably a good idea to invest in a laptop that weighs less than three pounds. If you&rsquo;re still unsure, don&rsquo;t sweat it. I&rsquo;ve put together a list of quick buying tips below. </p>



<ul><li><strong>Laptop type: </strong>There are many different laptop types that fall in the sub-$500 category: clamshells, 2-in-1&rsquo;s, Chromebooks, and much more. The displays on convertible laptops (aka 2-in-1&rsquo;s), for example, can swing around 360 degrees. This allows you to use the laptop like a tablet. They can also be propped up like a tent for viewing movies or participating in video calls. Chromebooks come in various shapes and sizes, and exclusively run Google&rsquo;s web-focused Chrome OS. With a Chromebook, all you need is a Gmail account and, boom, you&rsquo;re in. </li><li><strong>CPU: </strong>When it comes to the sub-$500 Windows laptops, you can expect to find Intel Core i3 or i5 processors. An i5 processor obviously provides a little more oomph. That said, basic office and web work does just fine on a Core i3. As for AMD options, the Ryzen 3 is good for basic productivity and web browsing, while Ryzen 5 chips rival Intel&rsquo;s Core i5 as solid all-arounders. For Chromebooks, Snapdragon and Pentium processors are more powerful than MediaTek chips. </li><li><strong>Graphics</strong>: At this price range, you probably won&rsquo;t find a laptop with a powerful discrete graphics card. Instead, you&rsquo;ll encounter laptops with integrated graphics, which are integrated with the CPU and use less power as a result. This is perfectly fine for everyday tasks, especially if you&rsquo;re not doing anything that&rsquo;s graphics-intensive&mdash;like 3D gaming.</li><li><strong>RAM: </strong>Always go for 8GB of RAM. That&rsquo;s plenty enough for firing up applications and loading web pages. Most Chromebooks are equipped with 4GB of RAM, which is the bare minimum. You need a decent amount of memory on these machines, as they&rsquo;re primarily web-based. If there&rsquo;s an 8GB RAM option, I&rsquo;d recommend springing for that. </li><li><strong>Display size:</strong> If you&rsquo;re a video editor or someone who does a lot of multimedia work, you&rsquo;ll want a display that&rsquo;s anywhere from 15- to 17-inches (but these machines usually cost far more than $500). The sweet spot for budget laptops is really anywhere from 13- to 14-inches. The bigger the display, the heavier your laptop is going to be. A 13- or 14-inch display is the best in terms of portability and value.</li><li><strong>Resolution</strong>: I wouldn&rsquo;t go for anything less than 1080p, as there&rsquo;s nothing more annoying than a slightly fuzzy image. 1080p produces a picture that&rsquo;s sharp enough for watching Netflix or working in Excel. At this price range, you won&rsquo;t really find many (if any) laptops with 1440p resolution or higher.</li><li><strong>Battery life:</strong> If you plan on taking your laptop anywhere with you, aim for something that can last 10 to 12 hours on a single charge. That&rsquo;s more than a full work day, so it should theoretically get you through long flights or a day of classes. Obviously, more is always better. Just know that the bigger the battery, the heavier the laptop.</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> The price really depends on your budget. If you&rsquo;re strapped for cash (been there, trust me), go for a Chromebook or an entry-level business laptop. These laptops are a good choice for students or young professionals. If you shop smart, you can even find 2-in-1&rsquo;s in the $500 range. </li><li><strong>Ports</strong>: A wide array of ports is always a plus, as it eliminates the need for an adapter. I&rsquo;d recommend a laptop that has both USB-C and USB-A. An HDMI port is good, too. This is especially useful for hooking up to an external monitor.</li></ul><div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-block faq-block"><h2 class="faq-block-title" id="faq"> FAQ </h2><hr class="block-horizotal-divider" /><div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block"><div class="faq-save-content"><span class="faq-rank">1.</span>
<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-regular-laptop-and-a-chromebook">What is the difference between a regular laptop and a Chromebook?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>When people talk about regular laptops they usually mean a PC or Mac. A Chromebook is still a laptop, but it differentiates itself from either of those two by using a unique operating system called ChromeOS, which was created by Google. Think of it like this: All Chromebooks are laptops, but not all laptops are Chromebooks.</p>



<p>Unlike other operating systems such as Windows or macOS, ChromeOS are optimized to run Google apps such as Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, and other Google services. Because most Google apps are online, Chromebooks generally require an internet connection to use most of their important features.</p>



<p>Finally, Chromebooks have historically been designed with portability, ease of use, and affordability in mind rather than top performance. They typically forego the faster high-end hardware that PCs or Macs use for a more minimalist, lightweight approach to computing.</p>

<h3 id="can-you-use-integrated-graphics-for-gaming">Can you use integrated graphics for gaming?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes, some of the latest processors with integrated graphics can run modern PC games at decent enough settings. For example, we found that in our tests, Intel&rsquo;s latest Iris Xe line of processors with integrated graphics can run some of the latest games at 1080p and 30fps. Unfortunately this is not the case for all integrated graphics and your mileage may vary drastically with older tech.</p>



<p>Intel and AMD&rsquo;s integrated graphics have made huge leaps in recent years with regard to gaming performance. If you&rsquo;re on a budget or looking for an ultra-thin laptop with integrated graphics you need not worry, you can still game on. We recommend checking out <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/633378/laptop-graphics-battle-amd-rdna-2-vs-intel-iris-xe.html">Intel&rsquo;s Core 12th-gen Iris Xe or AMD&rsquo;s brand new Ryzen 6000 RDNA 2.</a></p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>More and more the line between what is a laptop and what is a tablet blurs as companies integrate the features of both into their latest devices. But there are still a few key distinctions between the two. Laptops generally are larger, come with more storage, have better performance and productivity features, and may or may not feature a touch display. Tablets on the other hand are smaller and more portable, have longer battery life, feature a touch display, and are usually a bit more affordable. </p>



<p>When choosing between a budget laptop and a tablet you should first ask yourself what the primary use of the device will be. Do you need something for productivity with lots of storage? Then a laptop&mdash;even a budget model&mdash;will probably be the way to go. Or do you need something that is small, travels well, and has a long battery life? Then you might consider a tablet.</p>

## Black Friday desktop PC deals: What to expect and early sales

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year again and Black Friday deals have already begun, with retailers offering deals on everything from home-office computers to gaming PCs and all-in-ones. While we&rsquo;d normally advise you to hold out until Black Friday itself, some truly great deals are already available. What&rsquo;s more, many retailers are offering price protection so you can make your purchase now and rest assured you&rsquo;ll end up with the best price.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve curated the best deals on computers from all of your favorite retailers. We&rsquo;re already seeing some great discounts on desktop computers, particularly gaming PCs and all-in-ones from the likes of Dell, HP, Newegg, BestBuy, and more. We will continue to track down the best computer deals on offer leading up and during Black Friday and highlight them below.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Black Friday 2022 will fall on Friday, November 25th. However, many retailers have already started to offer great discounts on desktop computers.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>You&rsquo;ll see a dizzying array of deals when searching for a desktop computer on Black Friday, but they won&rsquo;t all be good values.  When looking at your new computer&rsquo;s CPU, get at least an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5, both of which will provide plenty of processing power for everyday computing tasks. If you don&rsquo;t intend to do any PC gaming, then feel free to save some money by going with integrated graphics. However, if you are looking to get your game on, we recommend at least an Nvidia GeForce 3060 or AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT, as these are the least expensive discrete graphics cards that can handle ray tracing well. If you aren&rsquo;t interested in those cutting-edge lighting effects, however, the RTX 3050 and Radeon RX 6600 also provide good 1080p gaming performance at even lower prices.</p>



<p>As for RAM, shoot for a minimum of 16GB for content-creation apps and gaming, but for general-purpose internet browsing and mundane office tasks, 8GB should suffice. Storage size is dependent upon your personal needs, but it&rsquo;s generally a good idea to opt for an SSD over a standard HDD as they are much faster and don&rsquo;t significantly affect the price of a desktop PC. Additionally, if you intend to go for an all-in-one with an integrated display, look for a display with a minimum resolution of 1080p.</p>

## Ubisoft games may make a long overdue return to Steam

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Ubisoft is one of the biggest entertainment companies on the planet, and a remarkably platform-agnostic one at that. The company has major releases on every platform and console, including mobile and cloud &mdash; heck, it was even a quick and steady partner for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/823826/best-cloud-gaming-services.html">game streaming services like Google Stadia and Amazon Luna</a>. It&rsquo;s strange, then, that every time the company releases a new AAA PC title, you have to look outside of the de facto PC gaming marketplace, Steam, to buy it. The company&rsquo;s newest games are only available on Ubisoft&rsquo;s self-branded store or Epic. </p>



<p>But according to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/YoobieRE&amp;xcust=2-1-1375361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a Github project</a> that crawls Ubisoft&rsquo;s launcher code for tidbits of information, that may not be the case much longer. &ldquo;Steam&rdquo; versions of both <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed Valhalla</em> and <em>Roller Champions</em> were found in the program&rsquo;s code, and Ubisoft Connect information was recently spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://steamdb.info/sub/0/history/?changeid=13278979&amp;xcust=2-1-1375361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> (and reported by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/ubisoft-may-finally-be-planning-a-return-to-steam/&amp;xcust=2-1-1375361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PCGamer</a>) as well. This indicates that Ubisoft is certainly considering a return to the Steam marketplace, if not actively working towards that goal. </p>



<p>Ubisoft made a hard break from Steam and its erstwhile competitor Valve in 2019, moving all of its newly-published titles to Ubisoft Connect (nee Uplay). It&rsquo;s hardly the first huge publisher to do so: EA has Origin, Activision-Blizzard has Battle.net. But EA is now offering PC games for sale on Steam again, and so is Activision. Despite ostensibly wanting their own walled gardens to keep users engaged with brands as well as individual games, the allure of hundreds of millions of active users is hard to resist. </p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s assume for a moment that Ubisoft does intend to return to the Steam marketplace. What&rsquo;s changed, aside from the simple desire to reach more paying customers? I&rsquo;d venture there are a couple of factors in play. One, Epic&rsquo;s Games Store is getting more crowded, just like Steam was a decade ago. With more AAA publishers on the store, Ubisoft&rsquo;s games aren&rsquo;t as unique and appealing anymore. It&rsquo;s no longer the biggest fish in a little pond. </p>



<p>But perhaps the bigger draw is the Steam Deck. Valve&rsquo;s portable gaming PC is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/633776/steams-best-selling-game-is-now-the-steam-deck.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a literal game changer</a>, and if you&rsquo;re not on Steam, you&rsquo;re not invited to the company&rsquo;s Linux-based SteamOS, either. While it&rsquo;s possible to run Windows on the Steam Deck, the vast majority of users stick with its built-in software and launcher, running Windows-only Steam games through the default Proton compatibility layer. It&rsquo;s still possible to run Ubisoft games on the Steam Deck, but you need to do so in Desktop Mode, and there are compatibility and performance issues. It&rsquo;s far from an ideal experience.</p>



<p>The mind of a gaming executive is an unknowable miasma of quarterly reports, microtransactions, and licensing fees. But if I had to guess, I&rsquo;d say that selling directly to Steam Deck owners is a bigger carrot than trying to force PC gamers into Ubisoft Connect. And besides, it&rsquo;s not as if Steam doesn&rsquo;t play nice with third-party game launchers already, to the grumbling of gamers everywhere. We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see when, and if, Ubisoft makes its less-than-triumphant return to the bigger pond. </p>

## How to add the Developer tab to the Microsoft Office Ribbon

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Did you know that Microsoft Office applications offer a special tab? It&rsquo;s called the Developer tab and it provides easy access to several unique but advanced features like writing macros and importing XML files (more on that below). However, it&rsquo;s not enabled by default. If you&rsquo;re not sure how to enable this tab, don&rsquo;t worry. We did the heavy lifting for you. Below you&rsquo;ll find a comprehensive guide on how to enable it.</p>



<h2 id="why-youd-want-to-add-the-developer-tab">Why you&rsquo;d want to add the Developer tab</h2>



<p>The Developers tab gives you quick access to many of the advanced features available in Office applications. These features include Visual Basic, XML commands, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/431700/5-essential-tips-for-creating-excel-macros.html">Macros</a>, document protection features, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402055/excel-add-ins-how-to-find-and-use-them.html">Add-in controls</a>, and more.</p>



<p>The type of feature depends on which Office application you&rsquo;re using. For example, XML commands make sense for Excel and there&rsquo;s an argument to be made for Word, but there&rsquo;s not much reason to have that feature in PowerPoint. There are many different Office applications, but here&rsquo;s a quick look at which features appear in the Developers tab in Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.</p>

Unfortunately, the launch of the $1,600 GPU has been marred by multiple reports of melting 12VHPWR connectors used in the cards damaging both the connector and the GPUs at times.</p>



<p>The new 12VHPWR connector is a compact power connector that combines the capability of multiple older 6- and 8-pin connectors into one tiny plug. It was originally adopted with the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Founders Edition and is now used in the GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition as well as custom versions of the RTX 4090 built by the likes of Asus, MSI, <em>et cetera</em>. The 12VHPWR connector will also be used in the impending GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition, slated to release on November 16.</p>



<p>As of Nov. 7, no less than 23 reports of melted connectors have surfaced in the Nvidia subreddit with another 5 unconfirmed cases.</p>

<p>With this fast-moving, confusing, and also very serious situation, PCWorld has decided to round up the facts you&nbsp;need to know to help separate fact from fiction. Nvidia officials have declined to comment while it investigates, but the latest development seem to point to bad 12VHPWR adapter cables. There&rsquo;s also the possibility that not fully inserting the cable may cause increased resistance and enough heat to melt the connectors. We&rsquo;ll update this story as new information is released.</p>

It&rsquo;s worth pointing out that the internal report seems to refer to the connection on the PSU side&mdash;not the GPU side. In general, however, ATX 3.0 power supplies PCWorld have seen indicate the cables to be identical on both ends.</li></ul><div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090" class="wp-image-1348187" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nvidia-GeForce-RTX-4090-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>

The GPU appears to be a Gigabyte 4090 Gaming OC using an Nvidia-branded 12VHPWR adapter cable. Both Nvidia and Gigabyte reach out to the owner who reports a replacement card has been received. A second report of a melted dongle is received as well on that day with damage to the adapter cable and an Asus RTX 4090 TUF Gaming OC Edition occurring. The Reddit post immediately goes viral on the high-profile graphics card with many assuming the new connector to be at fault.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Oct. 24</strong> A few hours after the initial melting report on Reddit, renowned power supply reviewer and the principle behind PSU certification company Cybenetics, Aristeidis Bitziopoulos, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://hwbusters.com/psus/12vhpwr-connector-cable-psus-size-watt-does-matter/&amp;xcust=2-1-1372988-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">attempts to replicate the melting </a>12VHPWR connector by subjecting it to 600 watt loads for more than 90 minutes.

Burke also notes that his five adapters all appear to be constructed the same&mdash;and yet differently than the adapter IgorsLab had. Burke said his five 12VHWPR adapters use wires labeled for 300 volts versus the 150 volts the adapter Wallossek had. Burke concludes that we just don&rsquo;t know what the issue is, but it is a real problem on some adapters&mdash;but not all of them. He also mentions a theory being floated that the smaller connector may not easily seat as well as the larger traditional power connectors. He also points out that contrary to what many consumers believe, a native connector that plugs directly into a power supply may also fail the same way if the native cable is constructed the same as the failed adapters. Burke also asks owners of RTX 4090 cards to report which cable adapters they have.</li></ul><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

Burke notes that while the cable marking may say 150V, that only means it uses the same apparent spec cables&mdash;and does not indicate they are may have the low-quality solder joints that IgorsLab found.

Unlike most of the testing so far, which used actual GeForce RTX 4090 cards, Buassali physically removes the 12VHWPR connector from the GPU and wires it up for stress testing. This lets Buassali push the connector assembly well past the 600 watts called for, including loads of 900 watts, 1,200 watts and 1,500 watts. Buassali&rsquo;s conslusion?  The 12VHPWR connector itself is &ldquo;well sized, so much so that it supported much more than its specification.&rdquo; However, Buassali concludes that even though the connector can handle more than it&rsquo;s rated for, a poorly inserted connector that creates resistance could indeed be behind the melting of the connector. Buassali also doesn&rsquo;t rule a batch of bad cables, but that implies a manufacturing issue, not a design problem.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Nov. 2 </strong>Jon Gerow, director of R&amp;D at Corsair and formerly of Jonnyguru.com, posts results from intentionally damaged 12VHPWR cable adapters under load and is unable to induce melting as well. Gerow was able to source multiple 12VHPWR adapter cables for destructive testing, and despite breaking off solder joints, he was unable to induce melting or a failure. He did note that some of the adapters weren&rsquo;t constructed very well but even the worst of the batch passed&nbsp;stress testing without failing. Gerow concludes that some of the problems may have occurred when the owners didn&rsquo;t fully seat the 12VHPWR adapter cables and also posts images of installed PCs where even a small gap of 1 mm could result in increased resistance.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Nov. 3</strong> AMD formally <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1371275/a-closer-look-at-amds-gorgeous-radeon-rx-7900-xtx.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">announces its RDNA3-based Radeon 7900XT and Radeon 7900XTX</a> and proudly notes that it did not use 12VHPWR connections. However, the company points out that the general perception that it changed its designs only after the melting problems cropped up a few weeks ago is not correct. AMD made the decision to stay with conventional 8-pin power connectors more than a year ago.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Nov. 4</strong> A new post in the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://new.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/yltzbt/maybe_the_first_burnt_connector_with_native_atx30/&amp;xcust=2-1-1372988-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nvidia subreddit, taken from a Facebook post</a> of a Hong Kong-based RTX 4090 owner, is the first reported damaged 12VHPWR cable from a native cable plugged directly into a power supply. Previous to this report, all of the reported issues had only occurred in 12VHPWR adapter cables, not native cables. The following day, another person reports a melted connector using a native 12VHPWR cable from an ATX 3.0 power supply.

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>As one of the biggest names in fitness trackers, Fitbit is an easy pick for recording your daily steps or sleep patterns. Choosing a Fitbit suited to your needs can be more complex, though. The different models have a lot of overlap in features, and so it&rsquo;s not straightforward which one is the &ldquo;best.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help out, we&rsquo;ve boiled down the options into simple categories for different levels of activity and habits. Whether you&rsquo;re tracking steps and sleep, or more detailed stats like oxygen saturation, you should be able to find the right match without paying for features you won&rsquo;t use.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em><strong>Latest news (Nov 2022):</strong> Looking for the Fitbit Sense, the company&rsquo;s top-end smartwatch? It&rsquo;s been succeeded by the new Fitbit Sense 2, but as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1361787/fitbit-sense-2-review-2.html">we explain in our review</a>, Fitbit&rsquo;s revamped smartwatch pales in comparison to its former self. You&rsquo;ll get a device that&rsquo;ll provide the best fitness and wellness tracking among Fitbit&rsquo;s offerings, but it&rsquo;s&hellip;not very smart. For now, our top Fitbit smartwatch remains the original Sense&mdash;grab one while stock remains.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>If all you want is a device that records steps, sleep, and heart rate accurately, the Fitbit Inspire 2 provides all that and more in a compact, slender tracker. In addition to basic tracking, you get automatic exercise tracking, silent alarms, a timer and stopwatch, reminders to exercise, water resistance up to 50 meters, and the ability to read your phone&rsquo;s notifications on your phone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And despite having fewer features than the Fitbit Charge 5, the Inspire 2 has several advantages of its own. You still get side buttons to control the device, which is useful when you can&rsquo;t flip your wrist or easily tap the screen. (The Charge 5 can only be navigated via its touchscreen.) The monochrome display also goes easier on battery life&mdash;the tracker is officially rated for up to 10 days depending on your activity level, as opposed to the Charge 5&rsquo;s rating of up to seven days. Occasionally, you can go even longer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can even track the device via Tile&rsquo;s app (yes, the company that makes Bluetooth trackers), a feature wholly unique to the Inspire 2 among Fitbit devices. So if you happen to take it off and misplace it, you can easily locate it. Add in the current promotion of one free year of Fitbit Premium, Fitbit&rsquo;s subscription service that provides more detailed metrics and access to workout and meditation sessions, and you get quite a bit of bang for your buck for $100 MSRP.</p>

<p>Overall, the Inspire 2 amply covers the basic tracking sought by people looking to get and stay active. If you don&rsquo;t need advanced features like on-board GPS, an altimeter, and extra health tracking sensors, you don&rsquo;t have to shell out for them.</p>

<p>Our only quibble is the charging cable, which secures with small plastic clips. It&rsquo;s a step backward from the original Inspire&rsquo;s cable, which magnetically attached, but not a dealbreaker.</p>

<p>As hybrid smartwatches go, the Fitbit Charge 5 is hard to beat. It packs in a wide range of features, ultimately offering the best of fitness trackers and devices like the Apple Watch in a single, affordable device. You get much of a smartwatch&rsquo;s experience without having to pay a smartwatch price&mdash;or give up a ton of real estate on your arm.</p>

<p>This latest iteration of the Charge line upgrades to a color display and adds in more health sensors for a full treasure trove of data. In addition to step tracking, continuous heart-rate monitoring, and sleep tracking, the Charge 5 offers automatic exercise tracking, the ability to map your run or bike route via on-board GPS, and sensors for monitoring oxygen saturation, ECG readings, and EDA scanning. Rounding out its capabilities are water resistance up to 50 meters, silent alarms, a timer and stopwatch, phone notifications, and support for contactless payment through Fitbit Pay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even with all of these features, the Fitbit Charge 5&rsquo;s battery life is rated at up to seven days, and in our experience with the tracker, you can sometimes stretch beyond that. The only thing missing from the Charge 5 are side buttons and an altimeter, which have been abandoned from the Charge 4. The touch-only interface makes using the device a little less convenient, and the inability to track floors climbed is a bummer. </p>

<p>Having trouble deciding between the Fitbit Charge 5 and the Inspire 2? Check out our article <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/554042/fitbit-inspire-2-vs-fitbit-luxe-vs-fitbit-charge-5-which-popular-tracker-is-right-for-you.html">that directly compares the two trackers</a>.</p>

<p>The Fitbit Sense is the fitness tracker for those who want it all. It monitors all the stats you&rsquo;d expect from such a high-end model, like step, sleep, heart-rate, swimming, and automatic exercise tracking, plus oxygen saturation, ECG readings, and EDA scanning. It comes with on-board GPS for mapping your routes during runs, hikes, and biking sessions. It has an altimeter for calculating the number of floors climbed in day.</p>

<p>But it also has features you&rsquo;d expect from a smartwatch: a big color display, hundreds of apps, a built-in mic to take calls from your wrist, the ability to store and play music on the device, contactless payments, and push notifications from apps. It makes for a nice blend of top-notch fitness tracking and core smartwatch functions. Plus the Sense lasts up to six days, handily beating out full smartwatches that typically max out at two days.</p>

<p>Why not get the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1361787/fitbit-sense-2-review-2.html">newer Sense 2</a>, which just released? Despite its superior hardware (including upgraded sensors), it&rsquo;s not a very smart watch. For starters, Google Assistant support has vanished, a puzzling decision by Google-owned Fitbit. Music support&mdash;even bare-bones controls for on-phone listening&mdash;has also disappeared, as have third-party apps. Given the Sense 2&rsquo;s $300 MSRP, you&rsquo;re better off upgrading to a $350 Google Pixel Watch if you need full smart features, or stepping down to a less expensive Fitbit hybrid watch, like the $230 Versa 4 or the original Sense (current street price of $250). Our vote currently is for the original Sense, as it has the core smartwatch features and sometimes goes on further sale as it slowly goes out of stock. Get one while you still can.</p>

<p>As an upgraded version of the Inspire 2, the Fitbit Luxe is named such for its sleek looks&mdash;this tracker features a color touchscreen and a svelte profile, plus the option of silver or gold tone accents. It also lives up to its name with a line of optional bands that are bolder and more fashionable than the more sporty bands available for other Fitbits. (A premium version with a metal-link bracelet is especially elegant.)</p>

<p>The Luxe&rsquo;s upgrades aren&rsquo;t purely aesthetic, however. In addition to tracking all the same stats as the Fitbit Inspire 2, you get the addition of an SpO2 sensor to monitor oxygen saturation. Nor does it sacrifice performance for looks (though in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/548603/fitbit-luxe-review-this-solid-trackers-deluxe-price-delivers-on-looks-not-features.html">our review</a>, we did find the touchscreen-only controls a bit finicky). For example, battery life is rated at up to five days, but we often exceeded that estimate while participating in regular moderate exercise.</p>

<p>Our main quibble with this Fitbit is its value&mdash;at a list price closer to the Charge 5 than the Inspire 2, it feels like you&rsquo;re paying more for style than substance. You won&rsquo;t be able to find another Fitbit that blends nearly as well with fancy outfits, though.</p>
