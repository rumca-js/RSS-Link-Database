## As Russia tries to dig in, Ukraine’s challenge will be to repeat its victory in Kherson

<p>With Russia still in control of a large swathe of occupied territory, Ukraine may encounter unexpected resistance as it tries to push south</p><p>Russia’s sheepish yet televised announcement that it will abandon Kherson city and points west of the Dnipro represents, on the face of it, a remarkable victory for Ukraine and a sophisticated military strategy. If the withdrawal does indeed lead to the swift recapture of the city, the Ukrainians will have done so with relatively little loss of life and without what could have been costly urban warfare.<br /><br />From the moment the Russian advance was stopped south of Mykolaiv in the spring, the invaders’ position on the west bank was obviously strategically vulnerable. But it has taken a careful three-month campaign to force the Kremlin to conclude it cannot hang on, beginning with the targeting of Russian logistics on both sides of the river with Himars and other longer range rocket artillery and which turned to targeting strategic bridges and then the pontoons that the Russians had to built to resupply their forces in the cross-river pocket.<br /><br />An immediate question is whether Ukraine will now encounter unexpected resistance as it tries to push south, but with the reconnaissance drone technology it has available it should be able to detect if there are any substantial remaining forces. Serious battles appear unlikely – although Ukrainian troops will have to be wary of mines left by the retreating invaders. Russia has been preparing its exit for a month now, moving command and control across the river and at least some of its experienced forces, before finally evacuating any sympathetic citizens and the bones of Catherine the Great’s chief minister Grigory Potemkin.<br /><br />But Ukraine will want to disrupt the Russian retreat as much as possible, capturing soldiers and above all equipment – turning the withdrawal into something like the near rout that took place in September when Russia made a similar decision, to withdraw from near Kharkiv and Izium in the northern part of the front to behind the Oskill river, in an attempt, only partially successful, to consolidate its position into the late autumn and early winter.</p><p>Of critical importance will be for Ukraine to secure the Nova Kakhovka dam, upstream from Kherson. Russian officials and military bloggers still repeat the implausible threat that Ukraine intends to destroy the 30-metre high dam, a hydro electric facility that Kyiv warns has been mined by the Russians. It is Russia that could gain most from destroying the dam, although it would likely be a war crime, further affecting Ukraine’s already battered energy supplies, and widening the vast river at what is currently a relatively narrow point – although it could come at the cost of disrupting Crimea’s water supply.<br /><br />Russia’s strategy is clearly to try and consolidate its territorial gains as it seeks to bring more of the 300,000 conscripts forward to stabilise the front lines, and turn the barrier of the Dnipro in its favour. That, though, is likely to turn attention to other parts of the front line, such as the front south east of Zaporizhzhia, which has been stable for months. The attraction for the Ukrainians is that attacking here could cut off the land bridge to Crimea.<br /><br />For now, though, Russia remains in control of a large swathe of contiguous occupied territory. But what Ukraine has consistently shown all throughout the autumn is that its military are able to respond flexibly and creatively as the war continues – think also of the recent daring <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/29/russia-suspends-ukraine-grain-deal-after-attack-on-sevastopol-naval-base">drone raid on Sevastopol naval base</a>. It was an approach signalled by Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak in August, where he said Kyiv’s ambition was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/creating-chaos-zelenskiys-adviser-outlines-ukraines-military-strategy">to create “chaos within Russian forces”</a> by striking at Russia’s supply lines as the attack on Kherson was only gearing up.<br /><br />Now, Ukraine’s apparent victory could not be more timely as Americans and Europeans worry about high energy costs ultimately caused by the war. The challenge for Kyiv will be to repeat it against Russians who are desperately trying to dig in.<br /><br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/09/as-russia-tries-to-dig-in-ukraines-challenge-will-be-to-repeat-its-victory-in-kherson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The “red wave” expected by Republicans and feared by Democrats failed to materialize</p><p>The mere fact that there are so many unknowns on the morning after election day is a sign that the night didn’t go as many had expected.

The final result won’t be the Republican landslide that Democrats feared or the big surprise that Democrats had hoped for.</p><p>But there won’t be much time for commiseration or celebration.

I wish you could give them to kids for Christmas, because a good story lasts longer than anything you can wrap up and put under a tree. A really good story will last a lifetime, whether you like it or not. I have such a story. It tends to come up when I am being interviewed to promote a TV programme I’ve made or, as has been the case recently, a book. Whoever is preparing for the interview casts around for something to ask, about anything – in their view – more interesting than the book. I imagine the production office conversation about my prospective appearance goes something like: “What, 10 minutes with him? How am I supposed to make that interesting?”<em> </em>It is at this point that someone, with the help of a search engine, will find a passing reference to the following story.</p><p>It was 1991. I was 24, just out of university, with a slow to heal, badly broken leg – a football injury. I didn’t have a clue what to do with my life but happened upon the idea of becoming a diplomat. Accordingly, I did the civil service entrance exams, the standard one and the fast-track test for graduates. I failed them both. And that was the end of that, until a short letter arrived in the post informing me that there was other government work for which I might be considered.<em> </em>I could only assume they needed cleaners or something. The address for a response was given as the director of establishments, Ministry of Defence. OK, so the MoD needed cleaners. Whatever. I ticked the box. Beggars can’t be choosers. I had a mediocre degree, a decidedly gammy leg and I was wildly overweight having been immobile for six months at my parents’ house with my mum providing a running buffet.

<p>Graham Fellows’ film Father Earth records the Sheffield comedian’s trip to Orkney with his dad – and a bid to step out of his alter ego’s shadow</p><p>When I last saw Graham Fellows in character as northern singer-songwriter John Shuttleworth, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/11/john-shuttleworth-review">back in 2015</a>, I felt – after years of adoring the act – that Shuttleworth could use a break and Fellows could use something new to do. It turns out that was already happening, as now documented in Fellows’ new film. Father Earth – a follow-up to his previous DIY documentaries, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/apr/20/1">It’s Nice Up North</a> and Southern Softies – traces the comic and his ageing dad’s trip to Orkney, there to convert a tumbledown church building into an eco-friendly recording studio.</p><p>That was the film Fellows thought he was making back in 2010, when most of the movie was shot. It’s not entirely the film with which he’s now touring venues around Britain, and which is released online next month. It’s hard to pin down exactly what story his final edit is telling, not surprisingly given its convoluted journey to the screen. Idea #1, Fellows explained at a Q&amp;A in London on Tuesday, was to film his effort to drive to Orkney in a dinky G-Wiz electric car. That idea was shelved when Fellows twigged to the logistical difficulties, but also when his 82-year-old father offered to join him on the trip. At which point, Father Earth became a buddy movie about a depressive comic and his dad trying to get a dream off the ground in the windswept wilds of northern Scotland.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/nov/09/graham-fellows-john-shuttleworth-father-earth-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Elon Musk’s takeover has seen an estimated million users leave the site. But was it already past its prime?</p><p>Like much of what has happened in recent years, the possibility of Elon Musk taking over and actually managing to destroy Twitter had the quality of a fever dream: something that would probably be a disaster but would almost certainly never happen. It felt likely that, even in the most dramatic case, he would succeed only in making an already bad platform slightly worse. Which is why the last 10 days have awed even Musk’s harshest critics: since he took over Twitter on 27 October, after firing thousands of staff and the company’s entire board so that he became its sole member, the site has truly begun to tank. By Musk’s own admission, the company is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/twitters-massive-revenue-drop-adds-heavy-debt-burden-2022-11-07/">losing</a> $4m a day – reportedly in large part due to advertisers fleeing.</p><p>In the few days after Musk’s takeover, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/11/03/1062752/twitter-may-have-lost-more-than-a-million-users-since-elon-musk-took-over/#:~:text=Silicon%20Valley-,Twitter%20may%20have%20lost%20more%20than%20a%20million%20users%20since,a%20million%20more%20were%20suspended.">more than a million people</a> are believed to have left the site, many in pursuit of an alternative Twitter-esque platform.

<p>As Wright pulls on the Black Panther catsuit, we meet Femi Oguns, whose acting school for black Brits – started two decades ago with a handful of flyers – is now Hollywood’s go-to talent hotspot</p><p>A few days before she was cast as Shuri in Black Panther, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/05/letitia-wright-britains-rising-screen-star-michael-caton-jones-leonardo-dicaprio">Letitia Wright</a> told Femi Oguns that she already knew she’d got the role. As a graduate of Oguns’ <a href="https://www.identityschoolofacting.com/">Identity School of Acting</a>, Wright had been close to him and his family since she was a teenager and was staying overnight at his house in London at the time. “In the morning,” recalls Oguns, “she sat down and said, ‘Femi, I’m going to tell you something: I got the role.’ I said, ‘What, they told you?’ And she was like, ‘No. But I’ve got the role.’ Somehow she just knew. And I believed her.”</p><p>Sure enough, two days later, Marvel called confirming that Wright had indeed landed the role that would change her life.

<p>This queasily thrilling documentary shows the global expansion of the beautiful game – and it’s so shocking it’ll make you ashamed to be a fan</p><p>Modern football – that is, a spectacle you feel a nagging shame from participating in, because like so many other things it seems less about joy and more about money with every passing day – began in 1974. The global sport’s governing body, Fifa, had previously been a parochial little outfit, a handful of men in suits happily organising World Cups that were simply football tournaments. But, under a new president, João Havelange, funds for the global expansion of the game were promised and, with no cash in Fifa’s account, sponsorship deals were signed.</p><p>Football just as sport for its own sake? That option no longer existed. Now it was brought to you in association with Coca-Cola and Adidas. Fifa Uncovered (Netflix), a four-part documentary, starts its story with the Havelange overhaul and peaks with the FBI making multiple arrests for corruption and racketeering a few decades later.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/09/fifa-uncovered-review-football-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The British government allies itself with many despotic regimes – including Qatar. The outrage shouldn’t end when the tournament does</p><p>A little-discussed dilemma of the LGBTQ experience is foreign travel. For many opposite-sex couples, exploring the world together is one of their great bonding experiences, teeming with adventure and generating a lifetime of soppy memories. For LGBTQ couples, this experience is rather more fraught. There are, after all, 69 countries where <a href="https://www.humandignitytrust.org/lgbt-the-law/map-of-criminalisation">homosexuality is prohibited altogether</a>, 11 of which can enforce the death penalty for same-sex attraction.</p><p>In many other countries – take your pick: Indonesia, Russia, Madagascar – being gay may be legal, but that doesn’t preclude widespread discrimination and stigma.

## Top 10 books about losing faith | Matt Rowland Hill

<p>Authors from Jeanette Winterson to William Shakespeare tell stories of people doubting not just God but everything that gives their life meaning</p><p>Losing religious faith can be a shattering experience, turning a universe that seemed full of providential order into a frightening and meaningless void. It is first of all an internal catastrophe – the voice of God falls silent, comforting certainties are overturned, notions of right and wrong vanish into thin air. This is surely one reason why writers of literature, the best means we have for depicting interiority, have been drawn again and again to the drama of faith and doubt in the individual soul. But a process that begins in the soul rarely ends there: losing faith can also mean losing family or community, and can force the former believer into seeking different ways of living, new illusions or new salves for pain.</p><p>In my memoir <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/original-sins-9781784743826?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">Original Sins</a> I tell the story of my own religious crisis and its aftermath. I grew up the son of a fundamentalist Baptist preacher in south Wales, but a devastating loss of faith in my teens soon led me to search for a substitute for God. At first alcohol and drugs seemed to provide the same sense of heavenly transcendence I’d once felt in church. But soon I developed a near-deadly addiction to heroin and crack, leading to brushes with suicidality and homelessness, a spell in a psychiatric unit and Hepatitis C. At last I set out to try and discover what life might look like without either drugs or God.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/09/top-10-books-about-losing-faith-matt-rowland-hill-original-sins">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>AFAS Live, Amsterdam</strong><br />Divided into three acts, this giddily theatrical show combines Y2K excess with a glorious affirmation of a none-more contemporary pop superstar</p><p>Lil Nas X is the rare pop star who has survived the whiplash caused by sudden fame. After his 2019 country-rap debut, Old Town Road, went from TikTok curio to US No 1 quicker than you can say “yeehaw agenda”, his debut album, last year’s Montero, cemented his status as pop’s newest superstar. Musing on fame, sexuality and mental health, it alchemised the 23-year-old’s tricky upbringing into gold-plated bangers and downcast anthems for dispirited youth, upsetting racists, homophobes, rap gatekeepers and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/mar/29/nike-denies-involvement-lil-nas-x-satan-shoes-social-media-uproar">trainer companies</a> with expert precision. The live arena remained his final frontier – the only previous showcases for his onstage prowess were a slew of elaborate, headline-grabbing TV performances featuring same sex snogs and unfortunate wardrobe mishaps. On his first ever tour, Lil Nas X delves into the album’s gloriously queer, David LaChappelle-esque world.</p><p>A thoroughly modern superstar – incredibly online, instantly divisive, proudly anti-genre – Lil Nas X’s ability to immaculately court (and curate) attention and controversy also feels like a throwback to a bygone era. In fact, the show – formatted as theatre, complete with its own Playbill-style programme handed out upon arrival – has the feel of a slick 00s pop extravaganza. For a start, there’s an elaborate, overarching conceptual framework. Based on the highs and lows of Lil Nas X’s accelerated, barrier-breaking career progression, it’s split into three sections: Rebirth, Transformation and Becoming. The chintzy set dressing – all gilded drapes, Y2K-era butterflies and neon-hued regalia – feels like a Britney Spears fragrance advert, while the lack of band, and the fact that the backing track of Lil Nas X’s voice can still be heard even when his mic is pointed towards the front rows, only adds to the glorious time-warp feel.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/09/lil-nas-x-review-defiantly-queer-showcase-for-rap-pioneers-triumphant-career">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Becoming a parent has made my Elder Scrolls marathons and hours-long Zelda sessions mostly a thing of the past. Now taking on a video game after hours is a rare lifeline to my former self</p><p>When I was a kid, I was only allowed to play video games on Fridays and Saturdays – an attempt by my parents to keep my gaming passion under control. (Narrator: it did not keep it under control.) For the rest of the week, I was happy doing other things and reading my Nintendo magazines, but come Friday evening, I was <em>ready</em> to pick up a controller. I would stock up on Haribo and fizzy juice on the way home from school in preparation for an evening in front of the TV. My parents, presumably grateful for a few hours of peace, would throw a Pizza Hut delivery through the door of the spare room where our games consoles lived and leave my brother and I to it.</p><p>We would sit and play Zelda or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/mar/15/thegear.steveboxer">Diddy Kong Racing</a> or another parent-approved, non-violent obsession of the day until we were commanded to go to bed. Once my mum pulled the cord out of the wall while we were in the middle of the final Bowser boss battle of Super Mario 64, causing a meltdown still spoken about in our family. I still think my behaviour was justified; pulling the plug is the equivalent of blowing the whistle moments before you’re about to score a winning goal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/nov/09/playing-games-into-the-wee-hours-was-a-teenage-pleasure-how-i-long-for-that-time">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The sports both evolved from the same ancestry, and threads link the American ‘national pastime’ to cricket fandom</p><p>At first, it’s likely to be some surface-level inclination. Maybe the way an evening ballpark illuminates the hyper-greens and the browns that it sits next to. Maybe the way the floodlights bounce off the hitter’s helmet, pronouncing a ghostly stillness each time the pitcher sets up to throw. Maybe it’s the first sight of a short stop receiving the ball drilled towards them, skipping while transferring it from mitt to throwing hand and – stretching time to their will in the same elasticated stride – throwing out a runner at first base.</p><p>Honestly, it could be any of the motor skills sunk into a player’s being – unthinking, sweet execution borne of the repetition of a lifetime, hiding any actual competition and instead presenting a kind of alpha ballet of all the pleasing ways a body moves. Maybe it’s just the clothes that do it for you. A walking, breathing map of implied American history. Or the sound – the congregated conversation behind the gently pleasing way a ball lands in a mitt.

If he wasn’t being monitored for chemo drugs, he was being treated for their side-effects: the nausea, the fainting, the headaches, the nosebleeds that wouldn’t stop. “We don’t give this course of chemo to adults,” said the oncologist. To my raised eyebrows, she answered: “They wouldn’t be able to take it.”</p><p>Covid meant that only his dad and I were allowed, one at a time, on the cancer ward. It was a surreal world of blue curtains, masked nurses and endlessly beeping machines. During my 10-hour shifts, I tried to encourage edifying activities such as French practice or reading, but most of the time my son and I either slept or watched crap television. The hospital didn’t have the internet, so we overdosed on episodes of Dinner Date, Taskmaster and reality renovation shows. When my son was well enough, we laughed at everything, pretending to ignore the tall bags of neon-yellow chemo-poison draining into the tube in his chest. I tried to keep his (and my) spirits up by planning what we would do after his treatment was over – a horse trek in Iceland, a gig at Wembley. Each week, we counted off the chemotherapy remaining: “Only 18 more weeks to go”; “We’re halfway through”; “We’ve completed the doxorubicin and cisplatin, now there’s only the methotrexate to get through.” When things got bad, I promised him: “One day this will be over. Life will be back to normal.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/09/a-moment-that-changed-me-my-son-was-relishing-life-after-recovering-from-cancer-so-why-did-i-feel-broken">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kim Hopkins’ thoughtful documentary about the Bradford Movie Makers club has some unexpectedly deep things to say about camaraderie, community and male friendship</p><p>It’s not an insult: the Bradford Movie Makers proudly call themselves a bunch of amateurs. Since 1932, members have been making virtually zero-budget films with rickety production values and acting of a quality that often results in fond mickey-taking among themselves. With this warm and rather wonderful documentary Kim Hopkins finds comedy in their idiosyncratic passion without ever being mean or mocking. A Bunch of Amateurs is a thoughtful film about film-making and has some unexpectedly deep things to say too about camaraderie, community and male friendship – though there are a couple of women in the club’s ageing membership.</p><p>There are some big personalities too. Colin, a retired carpenter in his 80s, is a veteran member who remembers the good old days, when the organisation had a waiting list of several years to join. In recent years numbers have dwindled and Bradford Movie Makers is on its uppers: down to 300 quid in the bank and five years behind on the rent for the crumbling clubhouse, where every Monday night you’ll find members brewing cups of tea and screening their magnum opuses. Colin, whose wife lives in a dementia care home, is waging a war on graffiti, and the rubbish dumped outside the clubhouse by fly-tippers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/09/a-bunch-of-amateurs-review-joyous-and-heartbreaking-celebration-of-film-making-passion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A kaleidoscopic journey through the rock legend’s musical influences – from Perry Como to the Fugs</p><p>When the young Robert Zimmerman discovered folk music in the late 1950s, he was transfixed. It seemed weightier and more serious than anything he was hearing on the radio. Overnight, he shunned his old favourites Little Richard and Fats Domino for singers of songs that he considered to be deeper, sadder, more despairing and more triumphant than regular pop music. Having created a new persona and invented a wandering minstrel backstory he became a figurehead for the folk movement, a messianic singer. He then spent the next 50-odd years playing with, and gradually unpicking, this persona. Now in his 80s, Dylan wants to bring us closer than ever to his teenage self, the kid soaking up everything he heard on the radio in his bedroom, before he became the masked character with seemingly biblical powers.</p><p>The Philosophy of Modern Song features 66 short essays on songs Dylan loves, beautifully illustrated with shots of old American record shops, casinos, fairgrounds, movie theatres and record-pressing plants. Here he is, guard down, eulogising Frank Sinatra’s Strangers in the Night. It’s unlikely, but it’s wonderful.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/09/the-philosophy-of-modern-song-by-bob-dylan-review-essays-on-songcraft">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Filling her new album Midnights with cryptic clues and hidden messages, the singer is just one artist transforming pop culture into a game. But social-media sleuthing can have a dark side</p><p>For <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a> fans, a new album is never just an album. When she announced her 10th record <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/21/taylor-swift-midnights-review-small-hours-pop-rich-with-self-loathing-and-stereotype-smashing">Midnights</a> in October, Swifties knew to expect a flood of Easter eggs, cryptic clues and mysteries in need of solving that would supposedly point to the record’s lyrical content, aesthetic and upcoming tour. Head to Reddit, Twitter or a specific corner of TikTok known as SwiftTok, and you’ll find fans analysing interviews, social media posts and the minutiae of her music videos, from the outfit colours and hairstyles to the significance of different buttons in an elevator in a music video. Each theory is backed up with Sherlockian levels of evidence: facts, figures, quotes and even the number of words used in social media posts all become pieces of a puzzle that may not even exist. It’s all part of the pop star’s plan: “I’ve trained them to be that way,” she has said.</p><p>This trail of breadcrumbs began with Swift’s 2006 self-titled debut album, the lyric booklet for which included a rudimentary code that would reveal who or what the songs were about, a practice she continued with 2014’s 1989. The music video for 2017’s Look What You Made Me Do was so<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/28/taylor-swift-look-what-you-made-me-do-music-video"> overloaded with references and clues</a> that Swift fans are still speculating about what details may or may not be hidden within it. They’re so well trained that they even find patterns that Swift has left unwittingly: prior to the release of 2019’s Lover album, theories proliferated over the significance of the number of holes in a fence in one Instagram post, which turned out to mean nothing at all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/09/how-taylor-swift-turned-pop-into-a-multiplayer-puzzle">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s on course to guzzle half the world’s carbon budget, so why are governments so afraid to discuss it?</p><p>There are just two actions needed to prevent catastrophic climate breakdown: leave fossil fuels in the ground and stop farming animals.

Neither of them has featured in any of the declarations from the 26 climate summits concluded so far.</p><p>Astonishingly, the sectors themselves are seldom mentioned. I’ve worked through every <a href="https://unfccc.int/process/bodies/supreme-bodies/conference-of-the-parties-cop">final agreement</a> produced by the summits since they began.

<p>Before Thursday’s announcement of the 26 players England intend to take to Qatar, we examine the key decisions for the manager</p><p>Gareth Southgate is not a fan of the 26-man tournament squad, believing it is more difficult to manage. And yet there is an upside. It allows him to include one or two players who have been out with injury and may not be ready to feature in the early ties. Before the European Championship in the summer of last year, which England kicked off on 13 June, Harry Maguire had been out with ankle ligament damage since 9 May and Jordan Henderson was only just coming back from the groin operation he underwent in late February. Southgate selected them both and it paid off handsomely in the case of Maguire, who missed the opening two group games but ended up in the team of the tournament. This time Southgate has decisions to make over Kalvin Phillips and Kyle Walker – likely starters under normal circumstances. Phillips is set to be in the Manchester City squad against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night, his first involvement since shoulder surgery towards the end of September. He has managed only 14 minutes of action all season. Walker is behind him in terms of a comeback date after groin surgery on 4 October, although Pep Guardiola says Walker “feels really good”. There is no decision to make on Reece James, another key player, who has not played since injuring a knee on 11 October. He is simply <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/09/england-world-cup-squad-reece-james-kalvin-phillips">too far away</a> from fitness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/09/marcus-rashford-callum-wilson-england-world-cup-squad-dilemmas-gareth-southgate">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From the cradle to the grave, the simple story of a Tasmanian man’s journey through life is luminously told</p><p>The third novel from acclaimed Australian author Robbie Arnott comes garlanded with high expectations, and within six pages it’s clear that despite its fey title, Limberlost stands a good chance of living up to them. Arnott has an eye and an ear for description that can elevate otherwise quiet moments to something genuinely transcendent: “He resumed walking through Limberlost, his father’s orchard, the rabbit swinging stiff in his hand. Smoke hazed from the house’s chimney. Apple trees in a nearby paddock had taken on the glow of dawn. At Ned’s back the river shone, teal blinking into slate and cerulean, revealing a greater truth of colour.”</p><p>That is, by any measure, a gorgeous paragraph, and the rest of the novel is full of similar moments. Arnott’s prose is syntactically sparse but linguistically rich; not unlike that of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/15/dig-cynan-jones-review-patrick-barkham" title="">Cynan Jones</a>, or the writer who (at a guess) influenced them both and many others, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/cormac-mccarthy" title="">Cormac McCarthy</a>.

<p>Jailed director Jafar Panahi plays a version of himself, forced to shoot his new film in a town near the border with Turkey</p><p>As Iranian women rise up against their misogynist bullies, this is a good time to watch Jafar Panahi’s latest film, set in a village whose inhabitants are encouraged to be scared of supposed “bears” roaming the countryside – just as the Iranian people are supposed to be afraid of their morality police. No Bears is a complex, mysterious metafiction about the anguish of Iran and the artist working within Iran. Its creator, film-maker and democracy campaigner Panahi, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/19/jafar-panahi-sentenced-to-six-years-in-jail">recently been sentenced to six years in jail</a> after long periods of house arrest since a bogus propaganda charge in 2011.</p><p>Panahi plays “Jafar Panahi”, a film director who is forbidden to make films or leave the country. So his new movie is shooting in a small Turkish town just over the border; it stars an Iranian couple, Bakhtiar (Bakhtiar Panjei) and Zara (Mina Khosravani), based on their own actual ordeal in trying to escape Iran for good. Panahi has delegated the hands-on direction to his assistant Reza (Reza Heydari), and he is watching the filming via Skype. He could easily do this from Tehran, but due to a compulsion to be close to the action (and to freedom), Panahi is doing this from a rented room in a tiny Iranian village just a few miles the other side of the border. The villagers themselves have accepted his cover story that he is there to photograph local customs, including a forthcoming wedding.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/09/no-bears-review-jafar-panahi-heads-for-the-border-in-complex-metafiction-of-fear">Continue reading...</a>

Sacchi lasted just over six months, and Antic returned in March 1999 to take over from the caretaker, Carlos Sánchez Aguiar. Despite leading the team to the final of the 1999 Copa del Rey, he was fired in June and replaced by Claudio Ranieri. After Ranieri was fired in March 2000, Antic returned for his third stint. Despite reaching another Copa del Rey final, he was promptly fired again.”<br /><br />Chai also suggests Francesco Guidolin, who had four spells at Palermo – including three in the space of a year. “After starting his second spell at the club in June 2006, he was fired the following April,” he writes. “The sacking was revoked and he was back at the helm within a month. However, after just two matches, he was dismissed again, this time to be replaced by Stefano Colantuono. In November 2007, Guidolin replaced Colantuono for his fourth stint at the club. This reunion was unsurprisingly short-lived, and he was fired on 24 March 2008.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/09/has-a-football-manager-ever-replaced-their-successor-knowledge">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Japanese writer lets readers inside his own head in an insightful collection of essays on his work and methods</p><p>Haruki Murakami is not one for getting out and about much. Famously, the Japanese’s novelist’s day consists of running, writing, listening to jazz and going to bed at nine o’clock. He doesn’t waste his time getting gussied up for television appearances or prize-giving shindigs; the organisers of literary festivals are used to having their invitations politely declined.</p><p>That doesn’t mean, though, that Murakami wants to remove himself completely from the world. Indeed, in many ways he seems to long to be known by it. His 2007 memoir <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/27/murakami-what-talk-about-running" title="">What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</a> was a meditation not just on the pain and glory of doing the 2005 New York City marathon, but also a slant-wise glimpse into what he almost certainly doesn’t call his “process”. Now he is back again, but this time looking straight and hard at the whole business, or rather the vocation, of writing novels.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/09/novelist-as-a-vocation-by-haruki-murakami-review-lessons-in-simplicity">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Elvis Mitchell delivers a vivid history of African American cinema, ranging from the unsung heroes of Hollywood’s golden age to the thrills of Blaxploitation</p><p>The title of Elvis Mitchell’s tremendous study of black American cinema is taken from Ossie Davis’s 1970 Blaxploitation buddy cop comedy Cotton Comes to Harlem, based on the Chester Himes novel, about a bale of cotton discovered in Harlem, of all the unlikely places: a bale which hides misappropriated cash and is of course a satirical symbol of oppression. Different characters wisecrack: “Is that black enough for you?”, riffing subversively on authenticity in the power struggle.</p><p>With a dense and fascinating mass of clips and interviews with figures in the movies such as Whoopi Goldberg, Zendaya, Samuel L Jackson and Laurence Fishburne, Mitchell fights back against cultural erasure and amnesia: there is a rich and vivid history of African American cinema which blossomed in Hollywood’s pioneering golden age, but was siloed in designated “negro” cinemas. (Martin Luther King is shown reminiscing about them.) Mitchell recalls unsung, or insufficiently sung, heroes of black moviemaking such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/12/pioneers-african-american-cinema-oscar-micheaux">Oscar Micheaux</a>, the first great African American film-maker who was an independent creative powerhouse from the silent age onwards.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/09/is-that-black-enough-for-you-review-tremendous-study-of-black-american-cinema">Continue reading...</a>

They are not the only bioluminescent sharks – roughly one in 10 species has that ability – but at up to 1.8 metres, kitefins are by far the biggest that have been found.<br /><br />Jérôme Mallefet, a biologist at the Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium, had been hoping for years to see a glowing kitefin shark. “That was one of my holy grails, to see that big shark glowing,” he says. Studies in the 1980s suggested they have light-emitting organs in their brown skin, but nobody had seen one alive and illuminated.</p><p>His dream came true 1,000 miles east of New Zealand, onboard a fisheries research vessel that was using a huge, commercial-scale trawl net to survey species inhabiting the twilight zone, about 800 metres down. Previous surveys of the area regularly caught kitefin sharks, but Mallefet was the first person to carefully transfer them into a darkened room. With the lights turned down low, he saw the live kitefin sharks had a blue-green glow across their bodies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/09/discovered-in-the-deep-the-sharks-that-glow-in-the-dark">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Zelenskiy says about 4 million people without power after targeted Russian attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure</p><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his forces would not yield “a single centimetre” in fighting for control of eastern Donetsk region</strong> after earlier insisting that restoration of Ukrainian territory and compensation from Russia were conditions under which peace talks could take place. “The activity of the occupiers remains at an extremely high level – dozens of attacks every day,” Zelenskiy said. “They are suffering extraordinarily high losses. But the order remains the same – to advance on the administrative boundary of Donetsk region. We will not yield a single centimetre of our land.”</p><p><strong>The Ukrainian president said</strong> <strong>about 4 million people were without power in 14 regions plus the capital, Kyiv</strong>, but on a stabilisation rather than an emergency basis. Russian missile and drone attacks have targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure for weeks as winter approaches when temperatures can drop as low as -20C.</p><p><strong>The Ukrainian military accused Russian troops of continuing to loot and destroy infrastructure in Kherson</strong>, where a showdown has been looming for weeks in the only regional capital Russia has captured since its invasion. “On 7th November, a convoy of trucks passed over the dam of the Kakhova hydroelectric station loaded with home appliances and building materials,” a statement said. Russian forces were dismantling mobile phone towers and taking away equipment, it said.</p><p><strong>Britain’s Ministry of Defence said Russia was preparing new fortified lines deep inside territory it controls</strong> “to forestall any rapid Ukrainian advances in the event of breakthroughs”. This involved installing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/08/russia-installs-dragons-teeth-blocks-in-shift-to-more-defensive-warfare">concrete barriers known as “dragon’s teeth” to stop tanks</a>, including near Mariupol in the south to help safeguard Russia’s “land bridge” to occupied Crimea even if Moscow loses other territory.</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy called on Tuesday for an extension to the Black Sea grain export deal that lifted a Russian blockade of three major Ukrainian ports and eased a global food crisis. </strong>The accord, brokered by Turkey and the UN in July, expires on 19 November and looked in jeopardy in October when Russia briefly suspended its participation before rejoining. Ukraine also wanted the grain export deal expanded to include more ports and goods, and hoped a decision to renew the pact for at least a year would be taken next week, the deputy infrastructure minister said in a Reuters interview.</p><p><strong>Pro-Kremlin forces in Russia are hoping that the Republicans win control of Congress</strong>, an outcome they believe could mean the Democratic president, Joe Biden, finds it harder to get military aid packages for Ukraine approved. But for now, few in Moscow expect the bipartisan US political consensus on Ukraine to crack, whatever the result of Tuesday’s midterm elections.</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/08/ukraine-urges-us-to-stay-united-as-potential-republican-win-threatens-aid">urged the US to stay united</a> in its support </strong>and for US politicians to maintain “unwavering unity” and follow Ukraine’s example “until peace is restored”.</p><p><strong>The US and Russia will soon hold talks on resuming suspended nuclear arms control inspections</strong> that had been put on hold during the Covid-19 pandemic and languished after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the state department spokesman Ned Price said. Negotiations on the inspections would take place “in the near future” under the terms of the New Start treaty and would not include any discussion of the conflict in Ukraine.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy">Zelenskiy</a> has told world leaders they will not be able to tackle the climate crisis unless Russia’s invasion of his country ends.</strong> “There can be no effective climate policy without the peace,” he said in a video address at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/05/cop27-crucial-climate-talks-more-fragile-than-ever-after-year-of-turmoil">the Cop27 UN climate summit in Egypt</a>.</p><p><strong>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will join next week’s G20 summit “if the situation is possible</strong>”, his Indonesian counterpart, Joko Widodo, who is hosting the meeting, said on Tuesday, adding that Putin could attend virtually instead. On Monday the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Putin would decide by the end of the week whether he would attend.</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy</strong> will take part in the G20 meeting in Bali, most probably attending virtually, his spokesman has told Suspilne, the Ukrainian public broadcaster. Previously the Ukrainian position was that Zelenskiy would not appear if Putin did.</p><p><em>Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/09/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-259-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
