And because of that, NY is sending 11ish new Republican congressmen to DC. If the GOP does manage to take the House, you're welcome.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Five swing races in New York according to NYT, GOP leads all five and is projected to win all five<br /><br />Lee Zeldin was spectacular at the top of the ticket <a href="https://t.co/w1X1zobxjg">pic.twitter.com/w1X1zobxjg</a><br />‚Äî Zachary Faria (@ZacharyFaria) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZacharyFaria/status/1590379273164328961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Here's the secret about New York. Take away New York City, and we're the purplest state in America. Even then, you could probably just lose Manhattan and Brooklyn. Everyone sees the progressive-utopian, crime-ridden stinkhole NYC is turning into but doesn't understand why voters in NYC keep reelecting the "leaders" who turned it into that. Out in the Hudson Valley and on Long Island (the most magical place on earth), voters see NYC and say NIMBY. NYC may be NYC. But the rest of New York is the rest of America.</p><p>This is why, and I know California knows what I'm talking about (shout out Jen Van Laar), conservatives make huge mistakes when they write off entire states. The cities may be lost. I don't have an electoral answer for NYC any more than Califonia conservatives have one for LA and SF. But the rest of the state is ripe for common sense, reform-minded conservative leaders.</p><p>And I wanted to introduce two of them to you now.

Shout out Tom.</p><p>Nick Langworthy is the reason I stayed interested in politics, in 2010 seeing another thirty-something as a county chairman not be afraid to tell the establishment where they could stick it. Though more importantly than anything else, Nick is why I know what a  Bills Mafia is. Shout out Josh Allen.</p><p>I've had the privilege to work with them. I have the honor to call them my friends.

Gather around and take a knee. I know many of you are upset at Americans that we aren't as enamored with Ukraine as we were in February, and you are unhappy with us questioning how many billions and billions of dollars we give the country. If you'll allow a suggestion, your fealty to  Volodymyr Zelenskyy doesn't help your cause as much as you think it does.</p><p>Sean Penn going to Ukraine to present Zelenskyy with his Oscar does not make me more receptive to giving Ukraine another tens of billions of dollars.

<p>This world event is a call back to the last time Sean Penn looked like a douche. He was being interviewed on CNN by Jim Acosta. Paint that visual in your brain. Acosta was the less of a douche.</p><p>Penn was upset that the Oscars were not going to invite Zelenskyy to address the Academy Awards. Instead, Hollywood's best and brights got to see Will Smith assault a man on stage. Penn was so upset at the Zelenskyy dis, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sean-penn-oscars" target="_blank">he threatened to melt his Oscars in protest</a>. </p><p>According to a source at the Academy speaking to the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website under the condition of anonymity, Oscars organizer responded "Meh."</p><p>Penn decided the better way to make a statement would be to travel to Ukraine and present Zelinksyy with the Oscar in person.

## Watch: 'Red flag' bro goes viral for way he destroys his wife with their wedding cake

And to be clear, the bride was not upset by the incident. It's her video. She says in the caption: "It‚Äôs official we‚Äôre Mr. and Mrs. Price. He got me back for doing it to him good and propa. Love my arsehole of a husband all the world."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="43332" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32067657&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Here's the rub with things that go viral. Everyone has an opinion on it. Things got so bad for Mrs. Price that she shut off all comments. But not before our friends at <a href="https://www.outkick.com/tiktok-users-label-groom-walking-red-flag-after-viral-video-goes-off-rails/" target="_blank">Outkick</a> were able to write a few of them down. I'm paraphrasing:</p><p><em>"I would divorce him right away."</em></p><p><em>"If my dad were there, he'd shove that cake right up his arse."</em></p><p><em>"ZOMG, like red flag much? What a walking red flag. Red flaggity flag flag."</em></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="9bed7" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32067669&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>I'm guessing everyone missed both parties laughing, and the alleged red flag bro helping her right back up. Also, and this is key, THE BRIDE POSTED THE VIDEO.  Call it a hunch, but I'm guessing she would not have done so if it was an assault or she felt her big day was forever ruined.</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/wedding-video-cheating" target="_blank">Guy sharing video of bride banging another dude at the wedding</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/new-york-islanders-proposal" target="_blank">shirtless dude proposing at a hockey game</a> were unintentionally funny.

## So, Pennsylvania elected a dead guy last night (no, not him... someone else)

</p><p>Pennsylvania House Democrats said in a tweet that while they're incredibly saddened by the loss (of life), "we are proud to see the voters to continue to show their confidence in him and his commitment to Democratic values by re-electing him posthumously." A special election will follow.</p><p>DeLuca didn't have a Republican opponent. His Green Party opponent, Queonia "Zarah" Livingston, ran on a leftist platform of "environmental justice," "ending the war on drugs," and "reducing gun violence." Thus proving the age-old adage that, even in Pennsylvania, voters say better dead than red.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

Emphasis on "yet."</p><p>It's causing supporters for both men to snipe at each other on Twitter with a lot of criticism going Trump's way. That needs to stop. We can't be fighting with each other like this. Not to mention, only someone as smart and handsome as Donald Trump would have the courage to put America First and step aside to endorse Ron DeSantis for president.</p><p>Let's everyone stop the infighting.

It is a bitter pill to swallow and I accept all LOLing coming from progressive Twitter right now, as I would be doing the same if the roles were reversed. But there were silver linings. Lee Zeldin kept things close enough in New York that we picked up enough GOP congressional seats to (hopefully) flip the house. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-victory-speech" target="_blank">Ron DeSantis did Ron DeSantis things</a>. And we say good bye to two of our favorite Democrat losers who were losers once more: Beto O'Rourke and Stacey Abrams.</p><p>Or, we think we say goodbye to them. Both candidate and their elitist out-of-state progressive fans have a fondness for setting piles of money on fire.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Let's start with Robert Francis "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/beto-trolled-hispanic" target="_blank">All The Latinxs Call Me Beto</a>" O'Rourke.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Beto puts up an impressive 0-3 record.

There was no red wave. The House is too close to call, though we are favored to win. The Senate is too close to call, where at best we can hope for is 51-49 after a run-off in Georgia. It stinks. Republicans, conservatives, and Trump fans need to have some long conversations we are not going to have at 7:41 AM, the morning after Election Day. However, one HUGE win was Ron DeSantis in Florida.</p><p>He was expected to win. But winning by 20% and 1.5 million votes? The red wave may have missed America, but it was a Red Wedding in the Sunshine State. You don't get a win that big by turning out only your base. As DeSantis' said in his victory speech, "it‚Äôs clearly apparent that this election we will have garnered a significant number of votes from people who may not have voted for me four years ago. I just want to let you know, I am honored to have earned your trust and your support over these four years."</p><p>Or maybe only two years? His speech also served up healthy servings of red meat: "We have embraced freedom. We have maintained law and order. We have protected the rights of parents. We have respected our taxpayers, and we reject woke ideology...We will never ever surrender to the woke mob. Florida is where woke goes to die!"</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">DESANTIS: "We will never ever surrender to the woke mob!
