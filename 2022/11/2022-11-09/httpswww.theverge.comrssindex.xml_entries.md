  <p id="vlKpUF">Like many other first-gen devices, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23400779/google-pixel-watch-review-wear-os-smartwatch-wearable-fitbit">Google Pixel Watch</a> has a lot of quirks. So far, early users have reported that the watch <a href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Android-App/Google-Pixel-Watch-overestimating-calories/td-p/5258365">dramatically overreported calorie burn</a> due to a bug. <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/the-pixel-watch-has-a-calorie-problem/">According to <em>Android Police</em></a>, the Pixel Watch team is aware of the issue and suggests rebooting the device could fix the problem. That said, it’s an apt reminder that calorie burn isn’t a reliable metric.</p>
<p id="f03myR">In the Pixel Watch’s case, the bug appears to have impacted how a user’s basal metabolic rate was calculated. Basal metabolic rate, or BMR, is essentially the number of calories you burn every day simply existing. It’s calculated based on factors like your age, weight, sex, and height. If you put in the wrong data, you’re going to get the wrong calorie burn....</p>

  <p id="TtHth0">This Thursday, a new Earth observation satellite will launch into space, where it will help scientists forecast the weather and keep an eye on increasingly common extreme weather events. The satellite, called Joint Polar Satellite System-2 (JPSS-2), is part of a global observation system and a product of a partnership between NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). </p>
<p id="1JldlP">“NOAA’s weather satellites have never been more critical as extreme weather events continue to be more frequent because of climate change,” said Irene Parker, deputy assistant administrator for systems at NOAA’s National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Services, in a prelaunch briefing. “From 2017 through to September of 2022, the US has...</p>

## How to record a phone conversation with an Android phone

  <p id="1eo0mf">There are a number of legitimate reasons that you’d want to record a phone call. For example, when you’re talking to a medical professional about, say, test results, you may want to make sure that you got all the information right. Or if you’re interviewing somebody for an article or for a job position, you may want to be able to make sure you remember the conversation accurately. Or if an older member of your family suddenly launches into a story about one of your grandparents, it might be nice to have a record of it.</p>
<p id="1ogIcp">Unfortunately, though, it’s become nearly impossible to record a phone call. As I explained <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23037242/phone-call-record-iphone-android-tapping-privacy-apps">in a previous article</a>, federal law in the US says that you can legally record a phone conversation <a href="https://www.justia.com/50-state-surveys/recording-phone-calls-and-conversations/">but only if you are taking part...</a></p>

<p id="5Og1AO">The code was analyzed by <em>WinFuture</em> writer Ronald Quandt, who found the doggy-nicknamed smartphones within and found that they run on Android 14.

  <p id="YDMbv5">Microsoft is releasing DirectStorage 1.1 this week, and the biggest new addition is GPU decompression for Windows PC games. GPU decompression is the next natural step in an industry-wide effort to improve game load times on modern PCs. Microsoft originally launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/14/22978223/microsoft-directstorage-api-xbox-velocity-windows-pc-nvme-load-times">DirectStorage earlier this year</a>, but developers have been calling out for GPU decompression support, and it now <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/directstorage-1-1-now-available/">arrives with DirectStorage 1.1 this week</a>.</p>
<p id="71M7Ia">GPU decompression works by offloading the work needed to decompress assets in games to the graphics card instead of the CPU. Right now, game assets are typically compressed when they are packaged up for distribution and then decompressed once a game is played. </p>
<p id="oCnRDI">The problem is most compression techniques are designed for CPUs,...</p>

  <p id="aHRqRg">After so many years of megapixel stasis, Apple finally upgraded the iPhone’s camera to a 48-megapixel sensor this year. Previously, the iPhone’s most advanced camera was the 12-megapixel main wide-angle sensor on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review">iPhone 13 Pro</a>. This hardware update brings it closer to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23399315/google-pixel-7-pro-review-screen-camera-battery-price">Google Pixel 7 Pro’s</a> 50-megapixel main sensor but nowhere near the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22941246/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review-price-screen-specs-stylus">Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra’s</a> 108-megapixel main sensor. </p>
<p id="VHgm4u">But more megapixels doesn’t always mean better photos, and the only way to really know how well a camera performs is to use it <em>a lot</em>. So for the second year in a row, I set out to take 1,000 photos on the iPhone 14 Pro, the Pixel 7 Pro, and the S22 Ultra in order to name the best camera on a smartphone. </p>
