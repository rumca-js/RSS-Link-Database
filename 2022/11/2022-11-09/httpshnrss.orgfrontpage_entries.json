Metlo works by discovering all your API endpoints, running security tests, and detecting potential attacks. It runs before your APIs go into production, and also in real time, alerting your security team when anomalous usage patterns are detected.  Metlo secures your APIs against the OWASP Top 10 (broken auth, injection, excessive data exposure etc.) and more.<p>Although APIs are one of the largest attack surfaces in companies today, there aren\u2019t many good security tools to protect them. The few tools currently on the market are \u201centerprise\u201d only; they require you to talk to a salesperson to use, or even see, the product.<p>We saw a need for an open-source solution that could be self-hosted and where you didn\u2019t have to talk to a sales rep to see the product. So we started building an open-source API security tool with an MIT license that you can self-host, fork, and generally do whatever you want with. Since not everyone wants to self-host, we also built a hosted offering that you can get started with for free.<p>Our website is at <a href=\"https://metlo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://metlo.com</a>, repo is at <a href=\"https://github.com/metlo-labs/metlo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/metlo-labs/metlo</a>. There\u2019s a demo video here: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/2c38c731cf044288995e5ee2566528a7\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/2c38c731cf044288995e5ee2566528a7</a>. Check out our sandbox at <a href=\"https://demo.metlo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://demo.metlo.com</a> (no email required). You can get started with our hosted service (in Beta) for free at <a href=\"https://app.metlo.com/signup\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://app.metlo.com/signup</a> (there\u2019s an always free tier, and paid tier is not enforced yet) , or you can self-host by following the instructions at <a href=\"https://docs.metlo.com/docs/deploy-to-aws\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.metlo.com/docs/deploy-to-aws</a>.<p>Our functionality can be divided into three areas \u2013 discovery (OSS), testing (OSS), and protection (closed source):<p>(1) Discovery: Metlo scans your API traffic and discovers all your public endpoints. This is especially useful for finding legacy, undocumented, and shadow endpoints your security team may not be aware of\u2014a particularly nasty way to end up with vulnerabilities. We scan each endpoint for sensitive data (address, phone numbers, ssn, account info, etc) and assign it a risk score so you can instantly understand your highest-risk endpoints.<p>(2) Testing: Metlo runs a suite of automated tests against your API traffic and endpoints so you can find vulnerabilities before an attacker does. We find issues like unauthenticated endpoints returning sensitive data, no HSTS headers, PII in URL params, and many more. You can also write your own tests.<p>(3) Protection: Metlo analyzes ongoing traffic patterns and surfaces anomalous behavior so you can catch and shut down potential attacks in real-time. (This is not part of our open-source offering though.) Our ML Algorithms build a model for baseline API behavior and any deviation from this baseline is surfaced as soon as possible. Our UI gives you full context around any attack to help quickly fix the vulnerability.<p>We\u2019ve tried to make it easy to set up and use Metlo (though deployment can still be easier and we\u2019re working on making it so). You can self-host on AWS, GCP, etc. (should take <5 min to do it) or use our hosted service at <a href=\"https://app.metlo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://app.metlo.com</a>.<p>We make money by charging for our hosted service, protection features, multiple users, SAML/SSO, RBAC, audit logs, and support. As for pricing, here we\u2019re a bit embarrassed because so far we have the dreaded \u201ccontact us\u201d for our enterprise plan with some early pricing for others. That\u2019s bad because, as mentioned, our goal is that you should never have to talk to a sales rep. However, we should have a \u201ccompare plans and pricing\u201d page figured out in the next few months.<p>We look forward to hearing your feedback and ideas, and your experiences with API security, and are happy to answer any questions!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33534856\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33534856</a></p>\n<p>Points: 18</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://blog.thunderbird.net/2022/11/thunderbird-supernova-preview-the-new-calendar-design/", "title": "Thunderbird Supernova Preview: The New Calendar Design", "date_published": "2022-11-09 17:22:20+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://blog.thunderbird.net/2022/11/thunderbird-supernova-preview-the-new-calendar-design/\">https://blog.thunderbird.net/2022/11/thunderbird-supernova-preview-the-new-calendar-design/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33534801\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33534801</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33534644", "title": "Ask HN: How do I find my \u201cpurpose\u201d?", "date_published": "2022-11-09 17:12:14+00:00", "description": "<p>(This is a serious question, despite my username)<p>There are plenty of studies that show that having a \"purpose\" and working after it is correlated with higher happiness or well being. \"Purpose\" is vague enough, so to make things worse I am going to conflate it with \"life meaning\", \"calling\" or \"personal values\". I recently came across the Japanese \"Ikigai\" which seems related.<p>Ok, I buy this, however, what is this \"purpose/ meaning/ calling/ value\" thing? What does it mean, really? How do I find mine?<p>I think this is the kind of thing a fair amount of people here in HN have thought about, so I thought of asking.<p>Is there any research that goes into what is \"purpose\" and how to figure it out?

It was inspired by alerthn.com and hnreplies.com.<p>The app was built in an experimental style. Instead of being a normal app where we store all your data, it is just a wrapper over a series of JavaScript snippets that we guide you through installing, and which you can then customize 100%. The scripts call out to Agolia\u2019s wonderful HN Search API. You can read more about the app\u2019s architecture and it\u2019s motivation here[1].<p>HN Follow runs on Val Town [2], an online scripting tool my team and I are building. Part of why we built hnfollow.com is to show off the kind of things you can do with the primitives Val Town provides:emailing yourself (`console.email`), persistent state (`@me.foo = \"bar\"`), persistent cron jobs (`setInterval`), etc. Here\u2019s a demo[3], the docs[4], and Discord[5] for Val Town.<p>We hope hnfollow.com is useful to you, and you have fun customizing the code directly on Val Town!

Pre-remote I was averaging around 9k steps per day, since remote that's dropped to < 4k. Going out for walks in the dark & rain at the end of the work day is not particularly fun.

Company ultimately did the right thing so I'm leaving out elements that would identify them.<p>I was once asked to remove a hardware safety mechanism from a medical device [1] and replace it with a software only function. Technical first, then we'll discuss wetware.<p>The process was started by, and results displayed on, an embedded Windows PC [2]. The PC didn't control any safety critical operations. Hardware peripherals had their own sensors, firmware, and safety mechanisms. You could incinerate the PC at any point and be fine.<p>There was a Big Red Button acting as a physical power cut-out. Request was to remove the physical button and rely only on a software (touch screen). Death was a remote harm, but moderate injury / user stuck in device / panic attack was plausible. And it's Windows, so duh.<p>Managers didn't contest my logic, but the request came down from none other than the Chairman of the Board of Directors of a publicly traded company, who was also a major shareholder and took a personal interest in the project. He ran over every layer of management until he ran into my skinny ass. I'm the runt of the litter that would have been pecked to death in the nest if his parents weren't so amazing.<p>I said no way. Not going to happen. Not going to do it. But I never hinted at resignation. They were going to have to fire me or go around me while I take discoverable notes.<p>That Big Red Button is still there to this day.<p>\"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed, citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.\" - Margaret Mead<p>Some suggestions for people in similar circumstances:<p>1. Live within your means and have savings. Hard to stand your ground if you're living paycheck to paycheck.<p>2. Suggest reasonable alternatives and keep cool.<p>3. Document. Even if it's just an email to yourself. Who, what, where, when, why, and how much. Update it as the situation evolves. Stick to raw facts you have direct knowledge of.<p>4. Research and cite applicable regulations or similar situations. Bring it up with company legal / regulatory affairs staff. Email them after the meeting with a summary of what you discussed.<p>5. Don't resign. Just put your tools down.<p>6. ---- I've never had to cross this line, but theoretically\u2026.<p>7. Sign nothing that looks like a liability release or NDA (often included in severance offers) if they terminate you.<p>8. Contact government regulators. OSHA, FDA, FAA, etc.<p>9. Nuclear option is go to the press, but I don't suggest that unless you can afford to bring a lawyer and love a shit show. You probably already signed an NDA before this point.
