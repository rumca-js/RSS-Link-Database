  <p id="5YKmLH">Apple will once again rely on Qualcomm modems for its 2023 iPhones, Qualcomm said on its Q4 2022 earnings call, meaning that we’ll be waiting a little while longer for Apple to introduce its long-rumored custom 5G modem.</p>
<p id="y59Qc4"><em>Nikkei</em> reported in 2021 that Apple was looking to introduce its own 5G modem in partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-taps-TSMC-to-build-custom-iPhone-5G-modem-in-2023">in 2023</a>, and Qualcomm had previously assumed that it would account for 20 percent of modem orders of the 2023 iPhones. However, on Wednesday’s call, Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala said that the company now expects to “have the vast majority of share of 5G modems for the 2023 iPhone launch.”</p>

  <p id="quY4Ql">It’s been a real WTF kind of year for car releases, new machines in new shapes with offbeat marketing leaning on gimmicky features that nobody asked for. Gimmicks are nothing new, but as I was pondering yet another incredibly quick, perfectly quiet EV, it occurred to me that I’ve been having an increasing number of head-scratching reactions to new cars over the past few years. </p>
<p id="sxTi4B">Cars are, by my estimation, getting weirder on the whole. While an endless number of oddball models have come and gone over the decades, we’re presently awash in an incredible density of quirky gimmicks and outré styling exercises. Why? Because the looming wave of electrification is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/18/23311254/dodge-charger-ev-daytona-srt-concept-muscle-car-exhaust-sound">commoditizing many of the features</a> traditional brands have historically leaned...</p>

  <p id="d0sS3F">Xiaomi’s <a href="https://weibo.com/2202387347/Md9WsmGUT?pagetype=profilefeed&amp;layerid=4831364845408191">new concept phone</a> allows a full size Leica camera lens to be attached to the back of a prototype version of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23278136/xiaomi-12s-ultra-camera-leica-versus-pixel-6-pro-galaxy-s22-iphone-13-max">12S Ultra</a>. The version of the smartphone released earlier this year is already notable for having a 1-inch-type camera sensor on its rear, which is far larger than those typically used in phones and more in line with what you might find in a compact standalone camera. Xiaomi’s new concept gives it both a secondary 1-inch sensor, as well as a full size lens to match. </p>
<p id="j1vROp">In a teaser trailer, Xiaomi shows how the concept is designed to work with lenses in Leica’s M-series lineup. The Chinese tech giant previously collaborated with Leica to co-develop the camera system used in the 12S Ultra, which <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_12s_ultra_brings_1inch_sensor_snapdragon_8_gen_1_and_leica_optics-news-54912.php"><em>GSMArena </em>reports</a> included...</p>

  <p id="dGIp0g">Google has been integrating its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23063809/google-lens-multisearch-feature-ai-io-near-me-scene-exploration">Lens image recognition tech</a> into several of its products for quite a while now, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23293383/google-lens-image-recognition-photo-how-to">Google Photos</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/24/23139304/google-chrome-lens-image-search-desktop-sidebar-panel">Chrome</a>, but now it’s putting it front and center. As <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/11/01/google-lens-search-homepage/"><em>9to5Google</em> points out</a>, Google’s added a Lens button right to its home page, in its famous search bar. That’s a big deal, <a href="https://twitter.com/rajanpatel/status/1587489793394372610">according to Rajan Patel</a>, a vice president of engineering at Google who’s in charge of Search and Lens — as he said on Tuesday, the Google homepage doesn’t change often.</p>
<p id="SlkLBd">Clicking on the Lens button (a little camera in Google-y colors) prompts you to upload an image or paste a URL to one. Once you do so, you’ll be taken to a page that’s pretty familiar if you’ve ever used the Lens app or any of its other integrations. </p>
