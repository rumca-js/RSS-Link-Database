The game works very differently in comparison to other collectible card games. You cannot really just spend money at the start for the best-completed decks. Though, you can purchase the game\u2019s season pass or starter bundle, acquiring and upgrading most of the cards is dependent on your own playtime. In this introductory guide to one of the year's surprise hits, we go through the best tips for beginners to snap up for the start of their journey in Marvel Snap.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Collecting cards</strong></h2><p dir=\"ltr\">It would not be a collectible card game without, well, card collecting, of course. In other digital card games such as Cardfight!! Vanguard Zero, Yu-Gi-Oh! Cross Duels, or Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel, you can purchase card packs to pull specific cards in a set, but sets or packs do not exist not in Marvel Snap.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To unlock more cards, you will need to upgrade the ones you already own. Upgrading cards increases your total Collection Level. For example, upon reaching Collection Level 222, you will earn a mystery card from a card pool. There are some cards such as Blue Marvel that can be earned by completing the season pass, but the majority of cards to unlock will be given to you by making your way through the Collection Level. <strong>There are thousands of Collection Levels</strong>.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-tips-and-tricks-for-beginners/1100-6508810/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-game-bundles-are-super-cheap-for-pc/1100-6508793/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Star Wars Game Bundles Are Super Cheap For PC", "date_published": "2022-11-02 19:36:00+00:00", "description": "<p>You don't have to go to a galaxy far, far away to live your dream of being a noble knight wielding a laser-sword in the name of justice.

Many cards are received randomly through the Collection Levels. This guide will go through some of the best decks, decklists, and strategies you can create that will have you triumph over your opponents in Marvel Snap. Here are our picks for the best decks in Marvel Snap.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Curving Crew</strong></h2><p>Curving Crew is all about playing cards on a curve. This means that you should have a card to play each turn ramping up to correspond to the amount of energy you have. Quicksilver will always start in your opening hand, so you can play him at the start of the match even if you do not draw your other 1-cost cards. Domino will always be drawn as your second card, and America Chavez will always be drawn on the sixth turn.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">By using these specific draw-turn abilities, you can set up a board without having to fret over not having cards to play each turn. You will almost always have something to play each turn to control the board. You play on a curve. This deck does not have many high-cost cards, so by turn four you can play Jessica Jones, and place Blue Marvel on another location at turn five, for example. Mister Sinister alongside Nightcrawler allows you to have three cards on a location with ease, then you can place an Ant-Man to receive its plus 3 ongoing effect.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-best-decks/1100-6508811/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genshin-impact-3-2-update-introduces-new-characters-nahida-and-lydia/1100-6508849/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Genshin Impact 3.2 Update Introduces New Characters Nahida and Lydia", "date_published": "2022-11-02 19:00:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Genshin Impact's 3.2 update introduces the divine Dendro character Nahida and the ever-sleepy Cyro character Layla.</p><p>In lore terms, Nahida is the vessel of Lesser Lord Kusanali, the god or Archon of the region Sumeru. Long trapped within the Sanctuary of Sursathana, she is now free and enters the game as a playable character. In gameplay, Nahida deals Dendro Damage with normal and special attacks. Her elemental skill is called All Schemes To Know, which spreads an area-of-effect Dendro damage around her. Holding the elemental skill button enters aiming mode, which lets her mark enemies and deal damage from afar. Her elemental burst brings forth The Shrine of Maya, which gains different effects based on the members of the player's party.</p><p>Layla is a Rtawahist student who studies Theoretical Astrology. She struggles with somnambulism and often can't sleep, and therefore seeks a way to steadily rest. In play, she wields a sword and can place a shield called the Curtain of Slumber.

Contrary to the bright atmosphere of the song, Mr. Sato's fresh appearance, which throws an axe and swings a sword, is a must-see.
