<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Despite being a 5-year-old title that was launched on what was basically smartphone hardware, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>is still one of the most visually appealing games ever made. The environmental design, mildly cell-shaded characters, and charming animations are a lesson in why good art direction can beat raw graphical power any day. But if you can have both, why not do so? One of the latest videos from a <em>Zelda </em>emulation fan shows the game running at an incredible 8K resolution with ray tracing modded in, courtesy of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s ferocious new GeForce RTX 4090</a>. </p>



<p>On the Wii U and Switch, <em>Breath of the Wild</em> is locked at 30 frames per second and maxes out at 1080p resolution. That&rsquo;s because the Switch is built on Nvidia Tegra hardware&mdash;ARM-based, high-efficiency tech that&rsquo;s also found in the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techhive.com/article/584131/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1366827-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed">Nvidia Shield set-top box</a>. But using the Cemu emulator and a top-of the line gaming desktop, plus brand-spanking-new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1074246/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Ryzen 9 7950X</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">GeForce RTX 4090</a> parts, YouTuber Digital Dreams was able to push the game far beyond its original graphical limitations. </p>

</div></figure><p>The video (spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://wccftech.com/zelda-botw-rtx-4090/&amp;xcust=2-1-1366827-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">WCCFTech</a>) really demonstrates some of the incredible design work that went into the world of<em> Breath of the Wild</em>. With the smoother animation and the added reflective qualities of the modified lighting engine, the beautiful scenery comes to life in a way that it simply can&rsquo;t on the Switch. The improvements aren&rsquo;t perfect &mdash; you can see the lighting engine struggle with pop-in, especially when it&rsquo;s handling thousands of blades of grass, shadows from trees, and fog effects in the notoriously choppy Hyrule Forrest. But it&rsquo;s still worth watching, especially if you happen to have a high-res monitor available. </p>

<p>Want to try this out for yourself? It won&rsquo;t be easy. In order to do it legally you&rsquo;ll need a Wii U copy of <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, which you can <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://cemu.cfw.guide/&amp;xcust=2-1-1366827-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&ldquo;dump&rdquo; to your PC and run on the free Cemu emulator</a> with a series of free tools. But even running the base version of the game is taxing for most desktop PCs. If you want to add the modifications for higher framerates, reduced anti-aliasing, and the ray tracing reshade mod <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.patreon.com/DigitalDreams&amp;xcust=2-1-1366827-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">from the Digital Dreams Patreon</a>, you&rsquo;re going to need a monster machine. </p>

## Turn your PC case into an extra monitor with Asrockâ€™s Side Panel Kit

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Transparent plastic and tempered glass have been the standard for PC cases for over a decade now. So if you&rsquo;re going to be constantly looking at your PC&rsquo;s guts, why not just end the pretense and stick a whole-ass monitor in there? That&rsquo;s the idea behind the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.asrock.com/mb/spec/product.asp?Model=13.3%E2%80%9D%20Side%20Panel%20Kit#Overview&amp;xcust=2-1-1368914-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Side Panel Kit</a>, a full 13.3-inch, 1080p monitor that sits behind the transparent panel of your PC case and connects directly to your motherboard. The screen acts as a standard monitor in Windows, displaying whatever you want. </p>



<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time we&rsquo;ve seen massive screens mounted directly onto a desktop PC. In addition to novelties like smaller LCDs attached to CPU AIO pumps, RAM, graphics cards, and probably the backside of the motherboard by now, you might recall <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/411607/ibuypowers-snowblind-case-will-make-your-pc-look-insane-for-a-very-low-price.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">iBuyPower&rsquo;s Project Snowblind</a>. It also turned the entire side of a PC case into a display, albeit a transparent one designed more to show supplementary data. In comparison, Asrock&rsquo;s screen is relatively basic. It&rsquo;s just a nice little IPS LCD that sticks to the inside of your PC case with the included mounting brackets. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Asrock side panel with retail box" class="wp-image-1368981" height="707" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/asrock-side-panel-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Asrock</p></div>



<p>While the screen should be installable into any case that can physically house it (you&rsquo;ll need a clear area on the side panel 300mm by 193mm, horizontal or vertical), there&rsquo;s one little foible to the design that might be a dealbreaker. The screen connects directly to the motherboard via an Embedded DisplayPort (eDP) cable for both data and power, as noted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/asrock-side-panel-display-kit&amp;xcust=2-1-1368914-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</a>. eDP is a standard connection often seen in laptop screen panels, but it&rsquo;s rarely seen in consumer-facing electronics&hellip;and Asrock is the only company making motherboards with an eDP connection built-in. There&rsquo;s no easy way to make an adapter, either, since unlike regular DisplayPort it includes electrical power as well. </p>



<p>At the time of writing <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=asrock+edp&amp;xcust=2-1-1368914-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">only a handful of Asrock motherboards</a> support the screen, mostly in the Z790 series (Intel 1700, with one B650 option for Ryzen fans). You can expect more high-end boards from Asrock to include the connection in the near future. Maybe by then the company will actually have an option to buy the Side Panel Kit, because it doesn&rsquo;t appear to have a shipping date or price at the moment. </p>



<p>In the meantime, you can always just <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1363856/this-cute-lil-monitor-attaches-to-the-top-of-your-laptops-screen.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">buy a USB portable monitor</a> and stick it to the side of your case. You won&rsquo;t even need a motherboard upgrade. </p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>If you&rsquo;re on the hunt for a chic everyday laptop, then you&rsquo;re in luck, as we&rsquo;ve got an epic deal for you today. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Gateway-15-6-Ultra-Slim-Notebook-FHD-AMD-Ryzen-7-Radeon-RX-Vega-10-Graphics-512GB-SSD-8GB-Memory-Tuned-THX-Audio-Fingerprint-Scanner-2MP-Camera-HDMI-/902605940?athbdg=L1100&amp;xcust=2-1-1368919-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Walmart&rsquo;s selling the Gateway Ultra Slim Notebook for just $249, which is a savings of $80</a>. The teal exterior is absolutely gorgeous and modern looking. Plus, it even comes with a fingerprint scanner for additional security and a precision touchpad. Let&rsquo;s get right into the specs.</p>



<p>This Gateway laptop is rocking an AMD Ryzen 7 3700U CPU, Radeon RX Vega 10 graphics, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of SSD storage. It&rsquo;s plenty fast for day-to-day tasks like browsing the web, checking e-mail, spreadsheet work, and so on. The 15.6-inch IPS display has a resolution of 1920&times;1080, which is perfectly fine for watching Netflix. For connectivity options, it has one micro SD card slot, one HDMI, one USB Type-C, and two USB 3.0. That&rsquo;s not too shabby!</p>



<p>This is a fantastic value. You better swoop in now before it&rsquo;s gone. </p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>There&rsquo;s a fundamental hurdle when it comes to designing a mouse that&rsquo;s supposed to be portable: Unlike a laptop, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to make a mouse both thin and comfortable at the same time. There have been attempts to get around this, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393679/best-wireless-mouse.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft&rsquo;s bendy Arc Mouse</a> or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002SAF3M&amp;xcust=2-3-1368114-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Logitech&rsquo;s pop-up V500 design</a> from back in the day. But a new Kickstarter campaign might be able to claim the thinnest mouse that&rsquo;s also pretty comfy, thanks to a fabric-based folding structure. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure><p>The Air.0 looks kind of like it started as a scrap from a tablet cover-kickstand. In its base state it&rsquo;s just 4.5mm thin (except for a nub of a sensor area, which is about three times as thick), but it folds up along its origami creases to form the usual &ldquo;hump&rdquo; shape of a wireless mouse. The mouse powers on automatically when it&rsquo;s magnetically assembled, and sliding feet at the four corners make it move like a typical optical mouse. Despite the super-thin profile, it uses real mechanical switches for the left and right buttons, though the central scroll &ldquo;wheel&rdquo; is a touchpad. A single recharge via USB-C can last for months. </p>



<p>The gadget (spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://gizmodo.com/air-0-kickstarter-travel-mouse-origami-1849722435&amp;xcust=2-3-1368114-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gizmodo</a>) would certainly be a lot easier to slip into a slim laptop case than a conventional mouse, or even hide in a pocket. But just how well it could replace a standard mouse (especially with that touch scroll area) remains to be seen. Surely the target audience of people so dedicated to portability that they&rsquo;d want a paper-thin, paper-light mouse are likely already fine with just using a trackpad. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Air.0 mouse gif" class="wp-image-1368125" height="403" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/7f3065c0fb1289f89701d5f3000c5d1b_original.gif" width="671" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Air.0</p></div>



<p>But if you&rsquo;re interested in giving the Air.0 a shot, it&rsquo;s available for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/air0/air0-the-foldable-bluetooth-computer-mouse&amp;xcust=2-3-1368114-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">don&rsquo;t-call-it-a-pre-order now on Kickstarter</a>, running until November 25. The cheapest tier to get a mouse costs $49, with estimated delivery in March 2023.

<p>Hybrid smartwatches always live in two worlds. As part of the Fitbit family, the Sense 2 leans toward fitness tracking, with light smartwatch features. You can&rsquo;t put one on and expect the experience of an Apple Watch.</p>



<p>But even given that design intent, the Sense 2 lacks the basics you&rsquo;d expect of a $300 wearable. While the hardware offers nice improvements, its software goes unexpectedly <em>backward</em>, with features in the original Sense nowhere to be found. The result makes the Sense 2 feel stripped down&mdash;and tanks its appeal.</p>

In a stroke of good news, the Sense 2 is compatible with the charger and wrist bands for original Sense and Versa 3, so if you&rsquo;re upgrading, you can reuse your existing accessories&mdash;unlike with Fitbit&rsquo;s less expensive trackers.</p>



<p>The Sense 2 also features a physical button, rather than the capacitive one on the first Sense. As exciting as that news was during the Sense 2&rsquo;s announcement, the button has a somewhat mushy feel&mdash;clicks don&rsquo;t bottom out cleanly. It&rsquo;s the kind of tactile feedback that makes one wonder if the button will start jamming toward the end of its life.</p>

<p>Fitbit&rsquo;s sequel to the Sense should be an easy recommendation. As a souped-up fitness and wellness tracker, there&rsquo;s much to like. It captures a boatload of data automatically&mdash;you get stats on steps, heart rate, and sleep, plus info that can clue you into the potential onset of illness or general health issues (skin temperature trends and blood oxygen saturation), possible heart-related health issues (ECG readings), and rising stress levels (continuous skin conductance). And the accuracy is decent enough to keep most number nerds happy, though you may find some variation compared to the Charge 5 and previous Sense. My resting heart rate estimates ran 2 to 3 bpm higher on average, which concerned me at first until I figured out it was the tracker, not me.</p>



<p>Several basic exercises (including running and biking) are also recorded automatically. Additionally, the Sense 2 can manually track an expanded set of other activities, with over 20 options like CrossFit, kickboxing, dance, and cross-country skiing. This broader array of options is a major improvement. Fitbit&rsquo;s auto-tracking is limited to just six categories&mdash;walking, running, biking, swimming, elliptical, sports, and aerobic workouts&mdash;and its trackers (including the Sense 2) will try to apply these categories to whatever activity you&rsquo;re actually doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, my dance sessions were splintered into irregular fragments labeled as &ldquo;Sport,&rdquo; &ldquo;Aerobic Workout,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Swim,&rdquo; mere minutes apart. Even when you <em>are</em> doing something that matches an auto-tracked activity, like walking, it&rsquo;s not always as accurate as starting a manual tracking session. But fitness trackers have never been precision instruments; having an expanded array of activities for manual tracking helps balance the scales. You can also input health details like menstrual cycles and blood sugar readings in the Fitbit app, which is accessible through your smartphone or the web interface.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Fitbit Sense 2 held in a hand showing manual exercise mode" class="wp-image-1362160" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IMG_2532-.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Manual exercise modes are fast to get in and out of, and work as they did on the original Sense. Stats show length of activity and real-time heart rate measured in one-second intervals.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Alaina Yee / IDG</p></div>



<p>The Sense 2 makes having all this data on your wrist far more comfortable, too. It shaves both weight and bulk from the original Sense&mdash;enough to be tangibly felt, even if the differences seem small on paper. If you have a small build, you&rsquo;ll no longer deal with slipping or sliding as with the chunkier, heavier original Sense (or skin irritation because you&rsquo;ve had to pull the band extremely tight in compensation). This smartwatch also rarely gets caught on sleeves when putting on a close fitting jacket. I actually sometimes forgot I was wearing the Sense 2 until it buzzed with a notification.</p>



<p>Speaking of, vibration strength on this watch is superb. On the Light setting, I could already clearly feel notifications come through, even while in motion or driving. With other trackers, including other Fitbit models, that sometimes isn&rsquo;t the case.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Sense 2 (top) vs Sense (bottom) on gray background" class="wp-image-1367411" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_3349-rz.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Sense 2 (top) is notably thinner and lighter than the original Sense (bottom).</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Alaina Yee / IDG</p></div>



<p>Battery life remains the same as the original Sense, with a rating of six-plus days. While not an improvement, it still provides plenty of time compared to full smartwatches that get a day or so at most. With the screen brightness set to normal, I got about seven days on average with moderate exercise (light daily walking, plus two sessions of strength training and two to three sessions of dance) and light notifications (average of two to six per hour, depending on time of day). You&rsquo;ll burn through the battery much faster with heavier use, particularly if you use GPS to track your route.</p>



<h2 id="disappointing-software">Disappointing software</h2>



<p>Your first interactions with the Sense 2 will be utterly smooth. Setup is much faster than with the original Sense&mdash;no more having to manually configure Wi-Fi for the initial round of software updates. It just happens seamlessly.</p>



<p>The operating system has been revamped and streamlined, too. While the look isn&rsquo;t dramatically different, jumping into modes or settings is far simpler. You will, however, to have to reorient if you&rsquo;re accustomed to the original Sense, as where you swipe to access notifications and apps have flipped all about.</p>



<p>It makes for a good first impression, and these positives can seem dominant if you only monitor workouts and health. The crashing disappointment comes when you try to lean on the smartwatch functions of the device&mdash;because there are barely any.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Sense (1st gen) apps" class="wp-image-1367416" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_3359-rz.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>App support for third-party services like Spotify (seen here on the original Sense) is nowhere to be found on the Sense 2. Why, Fitbit?</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Alaina Yee / IDG</p></div>



<p>Third-party app support is gone, for starters. You&rsquo;re limited to just Fitbit Pay, Google Wallet, and Google Maps, and the latter two still have yet to launch.</p>



<p>Music support has also swirled down the drain. No more on-board storage or controls for Spotify and Pandora controls. It&rsquo;s a huge downgrade.</p>



<p>Most dumbfounding is the removal of Google Assistant support. On the original Sense, you could use either Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa; now only Alexa support remains. How Google-owned Fitbit came to this decision is mystifying.</p>



<p>The changes to notifications are far less baffling, but still frustrating if you hate delayed information. Instead of rolling in one by one (as they did on the first Sense), a splash screen first identifies the app and, if multiple notifications are available, how many have been received. A short pause follows, then the most recent message or email is displayed.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Sense 2 notification splash screen (zoomed in)" class="wp-image-1367413" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_3366-rz-cr.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>On the Sense 2, notifications are first proceeded by a splash screen announcing the app (and when applicable, either the name of the sender or the number of notifications).</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Alaina Yee / IDG</p></div>



<p>This system is similar to that of Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1344061/googles-pixel-watch-revealed-the-ultimate-fitbit.html">brand-new Pixel Watch</a>, but feels much slower. The Sense 2&rsquo;s screen also fades in as it wakes, so it can feel like an eternity passes after flipping your wrist to see who or what messaged you. (The first Sense and the Pixel Watch do not have this transition to full screen brightness.) You can&rsquo;t change any of this behavior in settings, either&mdash;your only choices are to like it, endure it, or pass on the Sense 2 all together. And when asked, a representative for Fitbit said that there are no plans to later enable third-party apps or Google Assistant support.</p>



<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>



<p>Without any official comment, knowing the reason for the Sense 2&rsquo;s kneecapping is impossible. But given the timing of the Pixel Watch&mdash;just two weeks after the Sense 2&mdash;this outcome feels like Google attempting to guarantee the Pixel Watch&rsquo;s success.</p>



<p>Regardless, the Sense 2 is an unfortunate victim of confusing design decisions. Despite its excellent hardware, it&rsquo;s weak against the competition. For the same $300 price tag, you could buy the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/801487/pn/010-02700-00#specs&amp;xcust=2-1-1361787-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Garmin Venu Sq Music Edition</a>, which has third-party app and music support, plus a longer-rated battery life (up to 11 days).</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Sense 2 (left) vs Pixel Watch (right)" class="wp-image-1367415" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_3373-rz.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>If you need smartwatch features, the Pixel Watch (right)&mdash;or a competitor&rsquo;s offering&mdash;may be a better alternative to the Sense 2 (left).</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Alaina Yee / IDG</p></div>



<p>Alternatively, you could pay $50 more for a Pixel Watch (Wi-Fi model), which has more robust third-party app support and a user interface that feels faster. And though its battery life is dramatically shorter, you get cool features in compensation, like being able to take calls directly from the watch.</p>



<p>You can also just save money by leaning hard into the exercise tracking and opting for the $230 Fitbit Versa 4, which launched at the same time as the Sense 2. You&rsquo;ll lose the skin conductance, ECG, and skin temperature sensors, but if the wellness tracking isn&rsquo;t important, you can save $70.</p>



<p>Of course, you can just stick with the original Sense. If you don&rsquo;t already have one, you should be able to pick one up at a solid discount as retailers clear their stock. The Sense 2 is more of an incremental update, and unless you deeply yearn for that new cEDA sensor, you&rsquo;re not missing much. In fact, you&rsquo;d be gaining features.</p>

</div>


<p>The HP Envy 16 is a big-screen, content-creation laptop that packs a punch. With a roomy 16-inch 16:10 display, media professionals and hobbyists have plenty of space on which to work. And our test system features an OLED panel that offers a dynamic image with a stellar contrast ratio. Powering the display on our test system is an Intel Core i9-12900H CPU and Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 GPU, a duo that puts our test system on the high end of the price scale.</p>



<p>HP offers smart and wide-ranging configuration options for the Envy 16 and, while you can configure a model for your needs and budget, you&rsquo;re stuck with a rather hefty travel companion. At just over five pounds, the laptop is heavy even among 16-inch 16:10 models. I&rsquo;m also not wild about HP&rsquo;s trend of outfitting its laptops with low-contrast keyboards that feature silver keys and gray key symbols, a design decision that puts form over function. In the end, the Envy 16 doesn&rsquo;t surpass better content-creation options from Asus and Dell.</p>



<h2 id="hp-envy-16-specs-and-features">HP Envy 16 specs and features</h2>



<p>Our HP Envy 16 test system is priced over $2,000 and features the following specs:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Display: 16-inch UHD+ (3840&times;2400) OLED touch panel</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i9-12900H</li><li>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060</li><li>Memory: 32GB</li><li>Storage: 2TB SSD</li><li>Ports: 2 x Thunderbolt 4 USB Type-C, 2 x SuperSpeed USB Type-A, HDMI 2.1, audio combo jack, MicroSD media card reader</li><li>Camera: 1080p with Windows Hello support</li><li>Battery: 83 Whr</li><li>Wireless: Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.1</li><li>Operating system: Windows 11 Home</li><li>Dimensions: 14.1 x 9.9 x 0.8 inches</li><li>Weight: 5.0 pounds</li><li>Price: Starts at $1,399.99</li></ul><p>The HP Envy 16 line starts at $1,399.99 with a model that features a Core i5 CPU, 16GB RAM, Intel Arc A370M graphics, a 512GB SSD and a 2560&times;1600 IPS display. Our test system features upgrades to each of these components. Our test system&rsquo;s Core i9 CPU with RTX 3060 graphics, 32GB of RAM, and 2TB SSD are the highest options available. You could save $380, for example, by opting instead for the Core i7-12700H CPU with RTX 3060 graphics. You can also save $140 for sticking with 16GB of RAM or $170 if you go with the 1TB SSD instead of the 2TB unit.</p>



<p>The OLED display option is not yet available in the US. With just the touch-enabled 2560&times;1600 IPS display, the cost of our test system would be $2,199.99. Upgrading to the OLED panel will likely push the price close to $3,000. However, HP did not provide pricing info for the OLED panel. While our OLED panel provides bright white and true black levels, the 2560&times;1600 IPS display should be more than sufficient to create a crisp image across the 16-inch display. What you lose in contrast ratio and resolution you gain in refresh rate, going from 60Hz on the OLED panel to 120Hz. If you might be looking to put the RTX 3060 GPU to 3D gaming use in addition to content creation, the faster panel is of great importance.</p>



<h2 id="so-much-silver">So much silver</h2>



<p>The Envy 16 is a sea of silver. The all-aluminum chassis features a silver lid, silver keyboard deck with silver keys, and a silver bottom panel. With branding and design flourishes at a minimum, the laptop looks built for business. The company&rsquo;s funky HP logo is centered on the lid and below the display, while Envy badges are located on the keyboard deck and the back edge of the display lid. There&rsquo;s also Bang &amp; Olufsen branding on the keyboard deck to signify the sweet tuning of the laptop&rsquo;s quad-speaker alignment. (I&rsquo;ll get to the Envy 16&rsquo;s impressive audio output in the next section.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Envy 16 lid" class="wp-image-1366904" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/HP-Envy-16-lid.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>Not quite an inch thick, the Envy 16 cuts a fairly trim profile for such a large laptop. It&rsquo;s certainly more compact than gaming laptops and other high-end models that must keep RTX graphics from overheating. Looks can be deceiving, however, because the Envy 16 is heavier than it appears. It tips the scales at five pounds, which is on the heavy end of the scale for a 16-inch laptop. By comparison, Lenovo ThinkPad Z16 weighs only 4.3 pounds, and HP&rsquo;s own Spectre x360 16 weighs only 4.45 pounds.</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the good news on the keyboard. The keys are roomy and well-spaced and offer snappy feedback. HP also omitted a number pad, which I consider addition by subtraction. A numpad often makes an appearance on 16-inch laptops but does not here. I&rsquo;d rather have the keyboard centered under the display with no shortened keys than have it shifted over to the left with some keys diminished to accommodate a numpad. In place of a numpad, the Envy 16 has a helpful column of keys on its right side with Page-Up and Down, Home and End keys. Along the top row of Function keys are two appreciated inclusions: a key to mute the microphone and another to kill the webcam. Both keys have small LEDs so you know when each is enabled.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Envy 16 keyboard" class="wp-image-1366906" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/HP-Envy-16-keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>Now the bad keyboard news: with the Envy 16, HP continues its trend of outfitting its laptops with a low-contrast silver keyboard. The silver keys with gray key symbols make it impossible to read the keyboard in certain light. The keyboard can look blank, as if it&rsquo;s some sort of touch-typist test. And the keyboard backlighting often doesn&rsquo;t help since it just adds white light to the light silver keyboard. Why not stick with the tried-and-true black keyboard with white symbols? There&rsquo;s a reason that&rsquo;s the standard.</p>



<p>The touchpad is big enough not to feel cramped yet compact enough to avoid bumping it when you don&rsquo;t intend to. Its matte finish offers smooth gliding, and it accurately recorded my mouse gestures. The click response is spot on with the perfect amount of travel and a quiet response.</p>



<h2 id="awesome-av">Awesome AV</h2>



<p>The 4K 16:10 OLED panel on our test system is awesome. Incredibly sharp picture with an unparalleled contrast ratio and absolute black levels. It&rsquo;s rated for a sufficient 400 nits and&nbsp; covers 100% of the DCI-P3 color gamut. Colors look accurate and details remain visible in the brightest parts of an image as well as the darkest. For creators doing detailed image or video work, an OLED display offers clear advantages over an IPS panel.</p>



<p>The 16-inch 16:10 aspect ratio makes the display feel much larger than the 15.6-inch 16:9 widescreen display on last year&rsquo;s Envy 15. If you&rsquo;ve been working on a small laptop connected to an external monitor, the Envy 16 provides enough screen real estate that you won&rsquo;t need to link up to a monitor as much. It provides enough room to juggle multiple windows and work with two windows side by side. Unless you spend much of your time in front of your laptop watching movies, the 16:10 ratio is the way to go.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Envy 16 display" class="wp-image-1366909" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/HP-Envy-16-display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>If you are looking for a content-creation laptop that can also double as a gaming laptop, however, then you might want to forego the 60Hz OLED panel for the 120Hz IPS option. HP offers a lower-resolution 2560&times;1600 IPS panel with or without touch support, and each has a refresh rate of 120Hz that&rsquo;s a better fit for fast-moving games. And with the optional RTX 3060 graphics, the Envy 16 does have some 3D gaming capability.</p>



<p>The webcam provides two items on any laptop buyer&rsquo;s checklist: a 1080p resolution and IR capabilities. At 1080p, it displays a crisp, well-balanced image that&rsquo;s far superior to the grainy, over-exposed result of an older 720p camera. And with IR, the webcam works with Windows Hello to let you login via facial recognition &mdash; easier and more secure than a password. And while it doesn&rsquo;t have a physical privacy switch, you can kill the camera by toggling a Function button on the keyboard.</p>



<p>With its four-speaker array, the Envy 16 produces booming laptop audio. There are two speakers that fire upwards from either side of the keyboard, and there are two speakers that fire downward from the curved front edge of the bottom panel. The sound is surprisingly robust, with clear highs that are separate from the mid-tones and a bit of bass on the bottom end. The speakers have enough oomph for watching movies and shows without headphones &mdash; dialog was clear and effects sounded powerful. And music playback was enjoyable, a rarity among laptops.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Envy 16 left ports" class="wp-image-1366911" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/HP-Envy-16-left-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Envy 16 right ports" class="wp-image-1366913" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/HP-Envy-16-right-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>A pair of USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4 support highlight the port selection, but you also get two USB Type-A ports, which saves you from having to keep track of an adapter. Oddly, the USB-A port on the left side has a drop-down jaw while the USB-A port on the right does not require such awkwardness. I almost ripped the jaw off once by accident when putting the heavy laptop down on a table &mdash; handle with care. With no obvious need for the inclusion of a second USB-A port, I&rsquo;d rather HP skipped it. There&rsquo;s also an HDMI port and a MicroSD card reader, a useful inclusion specifically for a content-creation laptop to streamline getting files from your camera to the laptop.</p>



<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>



<p>Our loaded HP Envy 16 test system features an Intel Core i9-12900H, 32GB of RAM, RTX 3060 graphics, and a 2TB SSD. The Core i9-12900H is a member of Intel&rsquo;s Alder Lake H series of 45-watt mobile chips. It features Intel&rsquo;s new hybrid architecture with performance and efficiency cores; it has six performance cores, eight efficiency cores, and a total of 20 processing threads.</p>



<p>To compare the Envy 16&rsquo;s performance to that of the competition, we assembled a mix of other content-creation laptops as well as gaming laptops with midrange RTX GPUs, from the Lenovo Legion 5 Pro with RTX 3070 graphics to the Asus VivoBook Pro 15 and MSI Katana GF76 with RTX 3050 Ti graphics. In between these two bookends are other system with the same RTX 3060 GPU as the Envy 16.</p>



<p>Our first benchmark is PCMark 10, which measures performance on everyday computing work including office productivity tasks, web browsing, and video chats. All of the laptops here are overqualified for running general office apps. The Envy 16 was highly competitive with this very competitive group with a score above 7,000, although we would have guesses that it along with the other Core i9-based laptop in the Acer Predator Triton would have finished first and second and not behind the trio of laptops based on the Core i7-12700H CPU.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="HP Envy 16 PCMark 10" class="wp-image-1366916" height="619" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/HP-Envy-16-PCMark.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="898" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>Our HandBrake benchmark tests how a laptop is able to handle crushing CPU loads over a lengthy period&mdash;in this case, transcoding a 30GB MKV file to a format suitable for Android tablets using HandBrake, the free video encoding utility. The Envy 16 finished in the top half of the chart but was well off the pace set by the other Core i9-based laptops and also behind the Core i7-based Lenovo Legion 5 Pro and the Acer Nitro 5 that features the Ryzen 7 6800H chip.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="HP Envy 16 Handbrake" class="wp-image-1366917" height="618" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/HP-Envy-16-HandBrake.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="898" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>Next up is Cinebench, another CPU-intensive test but one that renders a complex 2D scene over a short period of time. The Envy 16 also finished near the top of our Cinebench chart. With a result north of 2,000, the Envy 16 is highly qualified for image editing and other media-creation chores.</p>

<p>The Envy 16 turned in a strong showing on both 3DMark tests. It finished near the top of the RTX 3060 pack on Time Spy and at the top of the RTX 3060 pack on Port Royal. Not surprisingly, the RTX 3070-based Lenovo Legion 5 Pro finished first on both tests, and the 3050 Ti machines brought up the rear.</p>

<p>Although the Envy 16 isn&rsquo;t geared toward gamers, we ran two of our 3D benchmarks on it to assess its gaming capability. On our Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark run at 1920&times;1080 with the Highest graphics preset, it averaged 97 fps. On the more demanding Metro Exodus at 1920&times;1080 at the benchmark&rsquo;s Extreme preset, it managed only 30 fps. Both framerates are in line with what we&rsquo;ve seen from other RTX 3060-based laptops and indicate the Envy 16 is capable of playing AAA titles as long as the resolution and quality settings are kept in check.</p>



<p>To test a laptop&rsquo;s battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 11&rsquo;s Movies &amp; TV app, with the laptop set to Airplane mode and earbuds plugged in. We set the screen brightness at a relatively bright 250 nits to 260 nits, which is a good brightness for watching a movie in an office with the lights on. With a large, high-resolution display powered by a high-performance CPU/GPU combo, the Envy 16 has challenges in terms of providing long battery life. HP smartly equipped the system with a large, 83 watt-hour battery that allowed the Envy 16 to last longer than 11 hours on our demanding battery drain test. That&rsquo;s an impressive result among the large, high-powered laptops assembled here.</p>

<h2 id="not-one-to-envy">Not one to envy</h2>



<p>As configured, our loaded HP Envy 16 test system provides ample power for content creators. However, at a price well over $2,000, it begins to feel as though we&rsquo;ve left HP&rsquo;s midrange Envy territory and entered the realm of the company&rsquo;s high-end Spectre line. There isn&rsquo;t anything about the Envy 16&rsquo;s look that&rsquo;s outright objectionable, but the sum total feels a bit disappointing given the price. The chassis is heavy, the low-contrast keyboard is annoying, and the overall plain silver look is a bit boring. Plus, the drop-jaw USB-A port is a pointless inclusion.</p>



<p>While we applaud HP&rsquo;s wide-ranging configuration options for the Envy 16, we&rsquo;d still steer creative pros to one of our two favorite content-creation laptops, the Dell XPS 17 or the Asus VivoBook Pro 16X OLED.</p>
