<p>The triumph of the far right, alarming enough in itself, could also see the destruction of judicial checks upon political power</p><p>In some ways, Tuesday’s election looked drearily familiar to voters in Israel – inevitably so, as the fifth in less than four years. Once again, it was fought to a large degree on whether <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu" title="">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, still on trial for corruption, is fit for office. The official results will not be declared until next week, and tiny shifts in votes could push smaller parties over the threshold for representation, which can be critical in the usually drawn out process of coalition-building. Nonetheless, it seems extremely likely that Mr Netanyahu <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/02/netanyahu-poised-to-reassume-power-with-help-from-far-right-friends" title="">will be back</a> as prime minister <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/02/benjamin-netanyahu-thanks-voters-as-exit-poll-puts-him-ahead-in-israel-election" title="">once more</a>, with a small majority in the 120-seat Knesset, after a brief interregnum.</p><p>Yet the results so far are also deeply shocking. They mark the triumph of the racist far right, in the form of Mr Netanyahu’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/02/king-bibi-is-back-again-but-what-next-for-netanyahus-latest-attempt-at-government" title="">Religious Zionist</a> allies, who want the deportation of “disloyal” Palestinian citizens of Israel and the annexation of the occupied West Bank. They are not only Mr Netanyahu’s partners, but <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/10/31/netanyahu-israel-religious-zionism-israels-political-virtuoso-in-denial/" title="">his creation</a>: he brought three far-right parties on to the same slate, welcoming them into the mainstream. Itamar Ben-Gvir, second on the list, is an anti-Arab former follower of the banned Kach terrorist group, with a conviction for inciting racism. Until his 2019 Knesset run, he had a picture of Baruch Goldstein – who massacred 29 Muslim worshippers in Hebron – in his living room. For years he was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/24/racist-and-reprehensible-jewish-power-set-to-enter-israels-parliament" title="">politically untouchable</a>. Thanks to Mr Netanyahu, he now dominates the third-largest political force in Israel, and is expected to become a senior minister.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>The latest conference, dominated by sceptics of recent research, will do nothing to bring clarity to the CTE debate</p><p>Another week, another conference. This one was organised by World Rugby and, like the last, which was organised by the Concussion in Sport Group, it was held in Amsterdam. World Rugby’s chief medical officer, Dr Éanna Falvey, explained that the aim was “to evaluate the latest research and focus on where we might need to focus funding to continue to fill the gaps in our collective knowledge”. There was a lot on the agenda: a session on instrumented mouth guards, a workshop on laws and player welfare, and, first thing in the morning, a series of talks on brain health and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.</p><p>World Rugby made all three available by live stream. It’s a positive step forward that the proceedings are open, and that anyone interested is encouraged to watch. It’s some of what they saw when they logged on that’s the worry. There were three speakers in the session on brain health. First up was the neuropathologist Dr Rudy Castellani, who is professor of pathology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, and the second was Dr Ken Quarrie, a specialist in the epidemiology of rugby injuries and chief scientist at New Zealand Rugby.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/02/worlds-rugbys-self-reinforcement-on-concussion-is-a-problem-for-the-sport">Continue reading...</a>

Right there in the title, in fact. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81331076">Killer Sally</a> tells the story of former US marine and female bodybuilder Sally McNeil, who was convicted of murdering her husband Ray, another bodybuilder, in 1995.

<p>Pugh drives forward Sebastián Lelio’s haunting adaptation of Emma Donoghue’s story of divine possession</p><p>Sebastián Lelio’s new film is an arrestingly strange, distinctively literary tale of innocence, horror and imperial guilt adapted from the novel by Emma Donoghue: the anti-miracle of a young girl’s mysterious possession by divine grace. You could put this in a double-bill with The Exorcist. Florence Pugh brings a pugnacious and forthright intensity to the role of Lib, an English nurse who in 1862 comes to a village in rural Ireland, commissioned by a somewhat pompous male committee of priests and worthies to be an expert witness in examining what appears to be a miracle<strong> </strong>unfolding under their eyes.</p><p>A young girl, Anna, has not eaten any food for four months and yet appears entirely healthy. Her stricken, awestruck parents Rosaleen (Elaine Cassidy) and Malachy (Coalán Byrne) receive a continuous stream of true believers in their cottage, who are allowed upstairs into her bedroom to speak with the sweet-natured, pious child. Anna is tremendously played by Elaine Cassidy’s daughter, newcomer Kíla Lord Cassidy. The parents have now agreed that Lib will keep watch over Anna to ensure that she is not hiding food, alternating every eight hours with a nun with the same task so that their mission is covered by both medicine and faith.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/02/the-wonder-review-a-compelling-passionate-reckoning-with-a-horrific-miracle-florence-pugh">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In memoirs by authors from Philip Roth to Michael Frayn, the Dad-Lit genre is always a little oedipal but there is also room for warmer feelings</p><p>The first father-son story to leave a mark on me had Abraham, on God’s orders, preparing to kill his only son: “He bound Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. Then he reached out his hand and took the knife …” God then calls off the infanticide; a ram is sacrificed instead. It’s meant to be an upbeat ending but as a child the story terrified me. There I lay, on a pile of wood, about to be murdered by my Dad.</p><p>Freudians offer a theory that’s the other way about, with the son killing the father. And the Dad-Lit genre can’t help but have a strain of the Oedipus complex, as the old man is ousted and the boy takes his place. But grudging affection is common too – for a life well lived, or a man who deserved better, or a rogue whose faults are dissected and, sometimes, forgiven. Daughters offer a different perspective on dads, with Jackie Kay, AM Homes, Kathryn Harrison and Aminatta Forna among the pick.

<p>As autumn’s array of delicious squashes hoves into view, this Italian classic is a welcome seasonal treat … but who makes the best version?</p><p>If there’s one compensation for the loss of summer’s glossy harvest, it’s the sweetness of so many autumn vegetables – most notably, of course, the pumpkins and winter squashes that have become indelibly associated with Halloween. A relatively recent addition to the European menu, they represent a welcome rush of sugar among all the bitter greens and starchy root vegetables that will inevitably dominate our diets over the next few months.</p><p>According to<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/oct/27/four-pumpkin-recipes-for-halloween"> Anna Del Conte</a>, pumpkin gnocchi, a more colourful and frivolous take on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/10/how-to-make-the-perfect-gnocchi">the potato-based version</a>, are a speciality of Veneto and southern Lombardy, where, presumably, they would generally be served as a <em>primi piatti</em> before the main event; they also pair beautifully with<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/23/italian-venison-stew-recipe-polenta-beetroot"> savoury game stews</a>, spicy sausages and <a href="https://www.lacucinaitaliana.com/italian-food/how-to-cook/how-to-cook-porcini-mushrooms?refresh_ce=">sauteed mushrooms</a>, though.

<p>Published for the first time, Through the Billboard Promised Land Without Ever Stopping, chimes with many of the obsessions the director carried through his films</p><p>In Sebastiane, Derek Jarman and Paul Humfress’ 1976 film, the soon-to-be-martyred Roman soldier is warned by his friend Justin to stop fighting against their pagan authorities. “The truth,” Sebastiane responds, “is beautiful”. As they speak, Justin tends to the wounds of the third-century saint in an act of love that has the potential to endanger both of them if they are caught by their tyrannical overseer or their fellow soldiers. This moment of intimacy is luxuriant; where there could be a palpable sense of terror, Jarman and Humfress instead focus on the tenderness between two defiant men.</p><p>Sebastiane’s “truth” is not just his devotion to Christ in a pagan society, but also his willingness to receive and give affection in the overtly masculine, violent and sexual environment of a military outpost. This is the kind of truth echoed in Jarman’s only known work of narrative fiction: Through the Billboard Promised Land Without Ever Stopping, which was written in 1971 and published for the first time in 2022 by House Sparrow Press. It follows a blind protagonist known as King who is accompanied on a trip across a mythical America by his valet John. On this trip (almost entirely on foot) they encounter pierrot clowns, poets excavating the land in search of old spoken verses and a mystic guide called Begum, who shows them the sights of Movietown. King and John, like Sebastiane and Justin, remain constants to one another in an increasingly unreliable and disrupted landscape.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/02/beyond-movietown-derek-jarmans-lost-novel-echoes-through-his-oeuvre">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new wave of indie horror games and remakes of haunting classics such as Silent Hill are getting more creative at trying to mess with your head</p><p>Halloween might be over, but the scary memories last a lifetime, at least for me. I do not like horror. I am one of the world’s biggest wusses, and feeding my imagination with nightmare fuel will keep me up at night for weeks. I was recently so disturbed by a simple bus advert for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/oct/02/smile-review-sadistically-effective-supernatural-horror">the movie Smile</a> that I read the Wikipedia summary of the plot, and just that was enough to screw with my sleep. My partner, meanwhile, cannot get enough of disgusting films and terrifying games, so he’s delighted to be living through something of a golden age for video game horror. Not only are haunting classics such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/jan/31/silent-hill-at-20-the-game-that-taught-us-to-fear-ourselves">Silent Hill</a> and Resident Evil getting endless remakes, there’s also an ongoing new wave of indie horror games that do ever more creative things with this medium’s ability to get inside your head.</p><p>These days, I actively try to avoid horrible things, but the games that freaked me out formed some of my most vivid childhood memories. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/dec/11/zelda-ocarina-of-time-at-20-nintendo-masterpiece-changed-games-forever">Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> had the Gibdos, desiccated corpses that lived in graveyards and dungeons. They could freeze Link in his tracks with a shriek, then walk towards him with horrible slowness, then speed up at the last second to leap atop his shoulders and try to suffocate him. And at the bottom of a well, there was an amorphous, eyeless, white monster whose many hands protruded from the Earth, ready to grab and ensnare. I had to play the entirety of the Shadow Temple, with its bloodstains and discordant choral music, through half-closed eyes and with a guide in hand.</p><p>Simon Parkin <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/oct/26/i-want-to-keep-being-the-first-hideo-kojima-on-seven-years-as-an-independent-game-developer">interviewed Hideo Kojima</a> for us in Tokyo. Kojima still won’t talk about exactly what happened during his infamous split with Konami, but gaming’s most famous director did discuss plenty of other interesting stuff, including how he feels about his past work and his conflicting relationship with social media.</p><p>CD Projekt Red’s original Witcher game is <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-1-remake-unreal-5-cdpr-rpg-fools-theory-1849704716">going to be remade</a>. I would love to revisit this game and I’m super-interested to see whether they will preserve the collectible “sex cards” Geralt collected by sleeping with every available female character. Those were gross at the time, but the idea has aged particularly badly over the past 15 years.</p><p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23432437/ikea-the-store-is-closed-indie-legal">Ikea is throwing a fit</a> over a horror game set in an obvious satirical stand-in for its stores, which would be quite funny if it wasn’t also forcing the developer to revamp the entire thing for fear of getting sued.</p><p>This <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23425085/splatoon-jelfonzo-fuck-you-shirt-inklanguage-translation">greatly entertaining feature</a> chronicles how players have come together over the years to translate Splatoon’s various in-game languages – only to discover that the dude who runs the clothing shop wears a T-shirt on Tuesdays that says “Fuck You”.</p><p>The manager of an Amsterdam hotel is dismayed that the building features in the <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/amsterdam-hotel-manager-criticises-buildings-inclusion-in-modern-warfare-2/">new Call of Duty game</a>. “We have taken note of the fact that the Conservatorium Hotel is undesirably the scene of the new Call of Duty … More generally, we don’t support games that seem to encourage the use of violence.

<p>This deft century-hopping novel follows the fortunes of a Regency portrait and a series of artists</p><p>Molly &amp; the Captain is a tale in three parts, skipping through the centuries from the 1780s to the 1980s. The sections are loosely connected by one fictional portrait: The Merrymount Sisters at Night by William Merrymount, a Gainsborough-esque artist in Georgian Marylebone. The Gainsborough references are frequent and unabashed, “Molly” and “The Captain” being his nicknames for the two cherished daughters he often painted, just as the fictional Merrymount paints his. Laura Merrymount, the elder daughter and “Captain” of this piece, is our first narrator. Although her father encourages her artistic talent she is trapped in his shadow, and the exhibition he persuades her to put on flops. “As a girl I was thought to be fond of Dominion,” she explains in regards to her nickname, but by her mid-30s, disappointed by life and love, she has cast ambition aside.</p><p>Anthony Quinn is an attentive author of late 18th-century life, and hits all the expected notes: trips to Bath, dissolute suitors, laudanum. His Lizzie Vavasor, the glamorous actor who befriends Laura, is nicely evocative of real contemporaries such as Dorothea Jordan, while Laura’s narrative is peppered with pleasing Georgian-isms – “chuse”, “partickular”, and best of all “landskips” (for “landscapes”).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/02/molly-the-captain-by-anthony-quinn-review-art-and-obscurity">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A lonely resting actor in Bucharest becomes more and more disturbed by nearby events and is not reassured by her husband</p><p>Not to be confused with the recent Netflix hit series, this is in fact a very solidly engineered Hitchcockian throwback. Company man Karl Glusman and resting actor Maika Monroe are the upwardly mobile young Americans relocating to a Bucharest bolthole boasting a prominent picture window; with hubby out schmoozing clients, his better half has time enough to dwell on a gruesome local murder spree, and the silhouetted figure peering down from an adjacent property. Suspicion shifts and moves closer and closer to home, but on one point Chloe Okuno’s film remains resolute: these characters would have avoided a lot of grief had they invested in net curtains.<br /><br />As recently as Wes Craven’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/sep/02/8">Red Eye in 2005</a>, we could take this species of medium-budget runaround for granted. Yet Watcher offers not just relief that it exists, but actual, genuine, old-fashioned thrills. Striding confidently into studio terrain after contributing to last year’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V/H/S/94">V/H/S/94 horror anthology</a>, Okuno works up a muted style and aces the setpieces: retooling passing extras as peripheral threats as the sound design goes right through you. She has punched up an underlying psychology in Zack Ford’s script: the wife’s mounting fears compounded by frustration at a Rational Spouse seeking to explain them away as girly misunderstanding. (Glusman’s heroically regrettable moustache offers its own grounds for divorce.)</p><p>Okuno describes this gaslighting for what it is, and that permits us the rare privilege of a mainstream thriller heroine who actually errs on the side of caution throughout. As in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/26/it-follows-review-horror-sex-death">2014’s It Follows</a>, Monroe is no pushover, and her reward for persistence, amid the nicely unpredictable finale, is a “told you so” moment for the ages. Unimprovably brisk at 91 minutes, Watcher is not messing around – and probably won’t hang around long in cinemas with starry awards fare in the offing. But a few more of these nifty diversions, and the multiplexes might once again be a viable night out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/02/watcher-review-gaslighting-and-in-romania-set-hitchcockian-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A fragmentary guide to the musical genius offers fresh insights to the creative process – but the personal remains private</p><p>“Those shrieks and warbles are beauty beyond belief to me,” said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/13/john-lydon-sex-pistols-johnny-rotten-danny-boyle-the-queen" title="">John Lydon</a> in 2009, recalling the day he came home with Kate Bush’s debut single, Wuthering Heights, and played it for his mother. She thought it sounded like “a bag of cats”, but Lydon, who had just left the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/sexpistols" title="">Sex Pistols</a>, heard a fellow renegade. Bush’s singularity makes fans feel like members of the biggest secret society in music, though it’s one they now share with the Gen Z-ers who discovered her last spring, when the 1985 single Running Up That Hill was featured on the Netflix series <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stranger-things" title="">Stranger Things</a>.</p><p>So, how to tackle Bush’s story in the year of her big return? The challenge for rock journalist and fan Tom Doyle is that his subject is a secret society in her own right. Bush’s infrequent interviews rarely reveal her thoughts about anything but music, as Doyle found when he spent four hours with her for a Mojo magazine feature in 2005, from which he quotes extensively. She chatted at length about her creative process – how she sang “through the decimal places of a mathematical constant” to concoct the song Pi, and such – but divulged nothing personal other than irritation that she was viewed by the public as “some kind of weirdo recluse”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/02/running-up-that-hill-by-tom-doyle-review-kate-bush-in-pieces">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Lyra McKee, killed by the New IRA in 2019, is shown here as an inspirational LGBTQ journalist, bravely addressing the lingering damage of the Troubles</p><p>Here is an admirable documentary about the brilliant life and tragic death of author and journalist Lyra McKee, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/22/lyra-mckee-friends-stage-protest-derry-offices-saoradh">shot dead in 2019 at the age of 29 by a stray bullet from the New IRA </a>as she covered riots in Derry’s Creggan estate. Apart from being a grotesque homicide, perpetrated by swaggeringly unrepentant and clumsy extremists, the McKee killing represented a culture clash and a generational collision. An inspirational young LGBTQ writer, McKee came from a Republican community in Belfast, had written on depression among the post-Good Friday generation, challenged the UK government’s line on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/13/ballymurphy-massacre-bereaved-to-receive-damages-from-mod-belfast-northern-ireland">1971 Ballymurphy massacre</a>, confronted homophobia in Catholicism and Islam, investigated the class inequality of the new peace dividend and – perhaps most importantly of all – started on what was set to be her first major work, a book entitled The Lost Boys, a study of the children who went missing during the Troubles, almost certainly in each case because they were witnesses to terrorist crime.</p><p>McKee was a young, fearless writer, a world away from the macho gangsters of old-school terrorism who still plied their trade, in thrall to the paranoia and buried shame which McKee understood but they didn’t. Moreover, McKee was a product of new media; she went directly to the riots when she heard about them, a first-hand observer instantly tweeting and shooting video, very different to the mainstream Troubles coverage of yesteryear, in which BBC or ITN reporters did grim pieces to camera the morning afterwards, repeating the official accounts from the army or the Provisionals, or, if they were there at the time, effectively embedded behind army lines.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/02/lyra-review-brilliant-life-and-tragic-death-of-northern-irelands-fearless-young-reporter">Continue reading...</a>

A few months ago, media outlets were working overtime to push out pieces about how nobody wants to work hard any more.

Instead of quiet quitting, everyone is loudly labouring.</p><p>Well, maybe not quite everyone, but one <a href="https://qz.com/the-guy-who-inspired-the-quiet-quitting-movement-is-b-1849704130">guy certainly</a> is. In March, Insider featured an anonymous recruiter using the pseudonym Justin who had started to deliberately slack off at work. That column inspired a TikTok; soon thinkpieces on quiet quitting were everywhere. The trend appears to have been short-lived though. The magazine recently caught up with Justin and found that his work attitude had shifted dramatically. Some of his colleagues had been laid off and he was worried about the economy. “Today Justin, the OG Quiet Quitter, is back to going above and beyond,” <a href="https://qz.com/the-guy-who-inspired-the-quiet-quitting-movement-is-b-1849704130">writes the journalist in the latest update</a>. “He is working 50 hours a week.”</p><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/02/with-the-global-economy-on-the-rocks-quiet-quitting-is-no-longer-a-thing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Coe is a compassionate witness to key moments in the life of a family and a nation</p><p>Jonathan Coe’s 14th novel<em> </em>opens with a snapshot of recent history that will stir fresh and uncomfortable memories. As the Covid pandemic is descending on Europe in early 2020, thirtysomething Lorna, a struggling jazz musician, is on tour in Austria and Germany. Lorna’s exhilaration at gigging overseas for the first time is tempered by a growing sense that the world is menaced by something extraordinary. It is both ominous and comic. Arriving in Vienna, Lorna can barely squeeze into her host’s car beside the stockpiled toilet rolls. For the reader, there’s an additional and more worrying dramatic irony: we can see that Lorna’s overweight musical partner, Mark, will be particularly vulnerable to the virus.</p><p>In Vienna, Lorna and Mark are taken to dinner by Ludwig, the owner of a small independent record label. A jazz fan and passionate anglophile, Ludwig is struggling to figure out what has happened to a nation he once admired for its tolerance, humour and self-awareness. “And now this same generation is doing … what? Voting for Brexit and for Boris Johnson? What happened to them? … What’s going on?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/02/bournville-by-jonathan-coe-review-a-bittersweet-slice-of-britishness">Continue reading...</a>

But some trains reverse in Aarhus, looping around the west side of the city, and then meander north. There’s a lot of Jutland still to come, and the 160-mile journey from Aarhus up to Denmark’s northernmost railway outpost at Skagen is a scenic delight. It offers not grandeur, but a pleasing mix of forest and heathland, agricultural and coastal landscapes. This is a journey to the very end of Denmark. Skagen itself is an extraordinary community, perched on a fragment of land poking into the sea where the waters of the Skagerrak and Kattegat straits mingle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/nov/02/rail-route-of-the-month-the-slow-train-to-skagen-denmark-where-the-north-sea-meets-the-baltic">Continue reading...</a>

A bit dramatic for the end of the group stages of a Twenty20 World Cup, but soon eight teams out of a dozen will be heading home or to their next assignments, thinking about what might have been and the disappointment of what wasn’t. And in Group 1, at least, the matter of which two teams get to stay a little longer will come down to pure and beautiful arithmetic. </p><p>Arriving at this tournament, England and Australia would have been worldly enough to know that they couldn’t expect to walk out of this group. They were diplomatic enough to cite every opponent as a tough competitor who could beat them on a given day. They were seasoned enough to know that this was true. And in their hearts, they would still have known that they should be the two to progress. The two biggest and best-resourced teams, one the host, the other the pace-setter in short form cricket for the last seven years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/nov/02/australia-face-tall-but-not-mathematically-impossible-task-to-keep-t20-hopes-alive">Continue reading...</a>
