There are people working in our government who saw Joe Biden's last speech (<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-portnoy-attacks-biden" target="_blank">what critics call the "he literally looks like Hitler speech</a>"), saw Joe Biden's recent performances on the campaign trail, and think this new speech is a good idea. </p><p>It's six days before Election Day. Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) are in a panic that voters are concerned with inflation and crime more than abortion and January 6th. Now, we're getting a last-ditch political speech by the most divisive president of the last two years.</p><p>A rational person would listen to the Democrat and media messaging that voting for a Republican means you hate democracy, and reach the conclusion it's Joe Biden's message too. Karine Jean-Pierre was none too pleased DOOCY asked such a sensible question.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">DOOCY: "Does...President Biden" believe "it is a 'threat to democracy' if somebody votes Republican?"<br /><br />KJP: "No. That's a--that's a ridiculous question. No."<br /><br />Doocy: "Why is that a ridiculous question?"<br /><br />KJP: "B/c American people should have their right to vote for whomever" <a href="https://t.co/Iu1fbt66IX">pic.twitter.com/Iu1fbt66IX</a><br />— Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) <a href="https://twitter.com/CurtisHouck/status/1587872168397905924?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>It's not a ridiculous question when it is almost verbatim what Joe Biden's political party and Joe Biden's fluffers in the media are saying. It's not a ridiculous question when it is almost verbatim what Joe Biden is saying. We've seen this most divisive president of the last two years <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/extreme-rhetoric-democrats-2022" target="_blank">lash out at half the country</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/filibuster-jen-psaki-peter-doocy" target="_blank">claim they're racist </a>for <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-tulsi-gabbard" target="_blank">disagreeing with him on legislation</a>. Or that <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/slavery-doocy-jean-pierre-kamala" target="_blank">they support slavery for agreeing</a> with the <em>Dobbs</em> decision. Or if like Karine Jean Pierre, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/doocy-jean-pierre-stolen-election" target="_blank">they question election results</a>.</p><p>Asking if Joe Biden believes voting GOP is a threat to democracy is a sensible question considering Joe Biden's rhetoric. It's a sensible question to ask before he gives a speech and is expected to say he believes voting GOP is a threat to democracy.</p><p><p>

## MSNBC declared voter ID laws are no longer 'racist' as much as they are 'transphobic' now

Not anymore. Now that trans people have cemented their spot as the #1 ranked pound-for-pound most marginalized group to leftists, leaving everyone else to battle drag queens for the #2 spot, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-votes-delaware" target="_blank">voter ID laws</a> are now traaaaaaaansphobic.</p><p>At least according to MSNBC news.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">NBC reporter: "Voter ID Laws disproportionately impact trans people." <a href="https://t.co/dV8iHEY56o">pic.twitter.com/dV8iHEY56o</a><br />— Washington Free Beacon (@FreeBeacon) <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeBeacon/status/1587818985894051841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>Voter ID laws disproportionately impact trans people because trans people are more likely to have IDs without the name that they go by and the gender marker that reflects how they present.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="0e0f5" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32035057&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Your name on the voter roles is the same legal name that would be on your driver's license or non-voter ID. Regardless of how you "present" yourself, if your birth certificate says Chad and your driver's license says Chad, it's going to say Chad on your voter registration. Yes, even if you "present" as Chadina. This is a make-believe issue.</p><p>Not to mention, even trans people <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nancy-mace-texas-democrat-id" target="_blank">need IDs to</a> buy alcohol, buy cigarettes, get a job, get on the payroll, fill a prescription, rent an apartment, buy a house, get a mortgage, fly, or open a bank account.</p><p>I guess with so many African-American voters leaving for the GOP, this is the left's way to punish them. They thought they could count on African-Americans to stick with them, even though Democrats don't think Americans of color can <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-vaccine-minorities" target="_self">access the internet</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-black-entrepreneurs" target="_self">hire a lawyer</a>, or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-junk-fees" target="_self">purchase airline tickets</a> without white Democrat help.</p><p>If Black-Americans aren't going to rally behind Democrats no question asked, the left is going to shamelessly pander to a group that will. Congrats to the Trans-American voting bloc.</p><p><p>

## Twitter users fact-check a White House tweet so hard the White House DELETES the tweet

Or, at the very least, provide context those users feel might better inform other tweeps. And, for some unknown reason, there weren't many instances of Twitter users taking advantage of this function on Democrat tweets until <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aoc-free-speech" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> took over.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="320c7" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32034798&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>The White House, or @WhiteHouse, discovered this the hard way. They posted a tweet: "Seniors are getting the biggest increase in their Social Security checks in 10 years through President Biden's leadership."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="bbb06" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32034822&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Dems are in disarray, so they trying to drum up fear <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-southern-accent" target="_blank">by scaring seniors about Social Security</a>. @WhiteHouse thought this would be a good tweet, forgetting that a) not many seniors use Twitter, b) it's a new day on Twitter where <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-closures-white-house" target="_blank">Democrats can get fact-checked</a>.</p><p>Twitter users added the following context: "Seniors will receive a large Social Security benefit increase due to the annual cost of living adjustment that, which is based on the inflation rate."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="d8085" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32034839&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>It's not Biden's leadership as much as it's Richard Nixon's leadership from 1972. Unless we're counting Biden's policies causing the inflation (according to critics).</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="39696" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32034840&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Now, you may have noticed I provided a screen capture of the tweet in question and not the actual tweet. There is a good reason for that. As I sat down to arrange the words you have been reading, <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1587546267923742725" target="_blank">it disappeared</a>.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Remember when the Executive Branch deleting tweets was a threat to democracy. It dies in darkness, you know.<br /><br />We are truly a blessed people.<a href="https://t.co/fOTqyy9yX4">https://t.co/fOTqyy9yX4</a> <a href="https://t.co/E38QqmFLYr">pic.twitter.com/E38QqmFLYr</a><br />— Sarah (gif/jif) (@mamaswati) <a href="https://twitter.com/mamaswati/status/1587830589998129154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>I could get upset at the hypocrisy of our freedom firefighters in corporate press not calling out the White House for such an anti-democracttic action. Instead, since I'm in such a great mood, I'll laugh at how embarrassing it is for all involved.</p><p><p>

## Daniel Radcliffe brags about the time he publicly shamed JK Rowling, the only reason he exists

<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32033600&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C24%2C0%2C94" /><br /><br /><p>JK Rowling is a liberal feminist and creator of the Harry Potter universe. Daniel Radcliffe exists to us for no other reason than being cast to play Harry Potter in the movies. For some reason, Radcliffe decided to take a trip down memory lane and brag about the time he threw Rowling under the bus to appease activists.</p><p>Rowling was a lioness of the left. Progressives would self-identify as Harry Potter sects as they "resisted" Donald Trump. It was as if they had never read another book in their lives</p><p>Then when men started self-identifying as women, Rowling chose the side <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-trans-speak-out" target="_blank">of women who were born that way</a>. Activists went berserk. Radcliffe joined other Potter alumni in throwing Rowling under the bus in 2020 proclaiming that "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/british-youtuber-goes-nuclear-on-daniel-radcliffe-for-his-transgender-women-are-women" target="_blank">transgender women are women</a>."</p><p>He could have left it there. A lot has changed since 2020. We now tell biological girls -- <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/locker-room-vermont-speaks-out" target="_blank">including teenagers</a> -- that if they have a problem with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/transgender-la-spa-woman-speaks" target="_blank">seeing another woman's penis</a>, they need to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-teammate-speaks-out" target="_blank">shut up about it or have their lives destroyed</a>. Also, we now say things like "another woman's penis." It's not me. It's the AP style guide.</p><p>Ratcliffe saw an opportunity to <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/daniel-radcliffe-against-jk-rowling-anti-trans-beliefs-1235420177/" target="_blank">further signal his virtue in 2022</a> and in a recent interview, relived that time he sh*t on JK Rowling.</p><blockquote>The reason I felt very, very much as though I needed to say something when I did was because particularly since finishing ‘Potter...’</blockquote><p>You knew if you didn't say anything they wouldn't let you make movies anymore. </p><blockquote>I don’t think I would’ve been able to look myself in the mirror had I not said anything. ... J.K. Rowling does not speak for everybody in the franchise.</blockquote><p>M'kay. So when JK Rowling speaks that it is wrong for police to put <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-scotland-police" target="_blank">rapists who have male genitalia</a> into prisons with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-scotish-law-activist" target="_blank">women who have female genitalia</a>, the franchise disagrees with Rowling? Do they agree <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-twitter-pipe-bomb" target="_blank">with the people threatening to kill her</a> over her belief that, while she supports anyone who wants to live their best lives, maybe -- just maybe -- some of the activism has gone too far?</p><p>A lot has happened since 2020, other than trans still ranks #1 on the left's pound-for-pound most marginalized rankings at the expense of everyone else. I get that actors like Ratcliffe are nervous about their careers and how quickly the left will have those careers taken away. But a simple "I don't want to talk about it" would have sufficed.</p><p><p>

## James Corden apologizes for 'inadvertently' stealing a Ricky Gervais joke after Gervais called him out

The poor schlub was publicly embarrassed for sh*tting on middle-class restaurant workers. Now, he is being shamed for stealing jokes. Though if you are going to steal jokes from anyone, Ricky Gervais is a brilliant comic to steal from.</p><p>Unless Gervais happens to catch a clip on Twitter:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>The premise was about Elon Musk buying Twitter.  As you <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-celebrities-leaving" target="_blank">may have noticed</a> by <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-fired-director-elon-musk" target="_blank">your frequent visits</a> to the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-twitter-managers" target="_blank">it's quite the major news story</a>.</p><p>Corden, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/james-corden-ricky-gervais-twitter-joke-1235252770/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">As reported by the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em></a><u><em>,</em></u> was all like this: "When you see Elon Musk talk about Twitter, he does this thing where he goes, ‘It’s the town square.' But it isn’t, because if someone puts up a poster in a town square that says ‘guitar lessons available,’ you don’t get people in the town going: ‘I don’t wanna play the guitar!’ But that sign wasn’t for you, it was for somebody else — you don’t have to get mad about all of it.</p><p>Ricky Gervais, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/james-corden-ricky-gervais-twitter-joke-1235252770/" target="_blank">in 2018</a>, was all like: "[It’s] like going into a town square, and seeing a big notice board that says, ‘Notice: Guitar lessons,’ and going: ‘I don’t f*cking want guitar lessons!’ Fine! It’s not for you, then. Just walk away, don’t worry about it."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="cb056" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32033530&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Corden is a late-night comic. It is safe to assume he doesn't write his own jokes and someone else "wrote" that for him. Stealing material is one thing. Accidents do happen. I sometimes am not sure what are my actual thoughts and what I got from <em>South Park</em>. But if you're going to steal from one of the most prolific comics out there, change a f*cking word. Because this is just lazy.</p><p>It would have taken no energy to change "guitar lessons" to "crochet lessons" or "karate lessons" or even "help me find my cat." That's unless the writer WANTED to embarrass Corden. Maybe Corden <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-corden-moves-audience-members" target="_blank">fat-shamed him</a> and it was the writer's way of lashing out.</p><p>Corden apologized. Corden also shut off replies to the apology.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Inadvertently told a brilliant Ricky Gervais joke on the show last night, obviously not knowing it came from him. It’s brilliant, because it’s a Ricky Gervais joke. You can watch all Ricky’s excellent specials on Netflix.

He confused Iraq for Ukraine <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-iraq-ukraine" target="_blank">and brain cancer for dying in combat</a>.
