<p>Meta is expanding its support for NFTs in a major way. The company is now allowing some creators to make and sell digital collectibles directly on Instagram, Meta <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/2022-launching-new-creator-tools"><ins>announced</ins></a> during its Creator Week event.</p><p>The platform has been experimenting with NFTs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-nft-test-meta-mark-zuckerberg-143326085.html"><ins>on Instagram</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-nft-facebook-test-133049681.html"><ins>Facebook</ins></a> since last year. But up until now, Instagram users have only been able to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-nft-rollout-083508514.html"><ins>show off</ins></a> their digital collectibles. Now, Instagram will have an “end-to-end toolkit” so creators can make NFT collections and sell them to their fans and followers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Instagram has been ramping up commerce features for creatures for some time, this update is the first time Instagram has tried to compete directly with existing NFT marketplaces. Notably, Meta so far hasn't disclosed how much of a cut it plans to take from NFT sales from Instagram. Creators can, however, set a commission rate for resales of their work, ranging from 5% to 25%.</p><p>The new tools are only available to a “small group” of creators in the United States for now, but Meta says it plans to expand to more people and countries “soon.” But the company is updating other NFT features that are more widely available. For collectors, Meta is adding support for the Solana blockchain and Phantom wallet, and enabling video NFTs in Instagram profiles. The app is also adding OpenSea metadata for “select collections.”</p><p>The expansion of NFTs on Instagram is part of a broader push by Meta to increase money-making features for the creators in its apps. The company is also expanding Instagram’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-creator-subscriptions-test-193856198.html"><ins>subscriptions</ins></a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-introduces-a-new-professional-mode-for-creators-140006876.html"><ins>“professional mode” </ins></a>for Facebook.

## The NYPD is joining Ring's neighborhood watch app amid privacy and racial profiling concerns

<p>One of the most recognizable police forces is joining <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-neighbors-app-request-for-assistance-posts-100025122.html">Ring's Neighbors app</a>. The New York Police Department has <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/news/p00065/the-nypd-it-will-join-ring-neighbors">announced</a> that it will participate in Ring's neighborhood watch tool. Officers won't look for posts "around the clock," but they will respond to users' crime and safety concerns, post notices and ask for help with "active police matters."</p><p>The move potentially gives the NYPD another way to interact with the community. It may also obtain footage of criminal activity that it wouldn't otherwise have, with maps and timelines that could help pinpoint crime sprees and trends.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There's already opposition to the NYPD's participation, however. The New York-based Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP) is <a href="https://www.stopspying.org/latest-news/2022/11/2/stop-condemns-nypd-plan-to-join-amazon-rings-neighbors">concerned</a> support for Neighbors will lead to more police violence, racial profiling and vigilantes. The technology "isn't keeping people safe" and even puts people in danger, Executive Director Albert Fox Cahn claims. He cites an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ring-condemns-vigilantism-florida-shooting-security-doorbell-2022-10">incident</a> in October where a father and son shot at a woman in response to a Ring doorbell notification. The woman delivered a package sent to the wrong address.</p><p>Ring has previously stressed that device users aren't required to share footage, and it has addressed some worries about enabling police surveillance by requiring public, narrowly focused requests within 12 hours of incidents. There are still fears Ring cameras and doorbells are collecting footage of innocent passers-by, though, and that Neighbors users may be racially biased when reporting suspicious behavior. The company has also grappled with a number of security flaws, including a bug that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-neighbors-app-exposed-precise-locations-171635602.html">exposed precise locations</a>.</p>

## Elizabeth Warren wants regulators to examine Big Tech's expansion into autos

<p>Elizabeth Warren is calling for more federal oversight of Big Tech. In a letter (<a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2022.11.01%20Letter%20to%20FTC%20on%20Big%20Tech%20Auto.pdf"><ins>PDF link</ins></a>) the Democratic senator <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-urges-ftc-and-doj-to-conduct-increased-oversight-of-big-tech-companies-expansion-in-automotive-industry"><ins>sent on Tuesday</ins></a>, she asked the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice to look into Google, Apple and Amazon’s expansion into the automotive industry.</p><p>Warren claims the three companies are using their positions in mobile and cloud computing to become dominant players within the sector. “This expansion has potentially alarming implications for developers, workers, and consumers,” Warren states. She’s urging FTC Chair Lina Khan and Jonathan Kanter, the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, to act decisively before it’s too late. “As Chair Khan has <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/e.710.Khan.805_zuvfyyeh.pdf"><ins>written</ins></a>, ‘it is much easier to promote competition at the point when a market risks becoming less competitive than it is at the point when a market is no longer competitive.’ This market finds itself at exactly such a juncture,” Warren warns.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Specifically, the senator calls out the companies for employing “all-or-nothing” bundling tactics. As one example, she points to the terms of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-auto-is-getting-a-major-ui-update-google-io-2022-160002501.html">Android Automotive</a>. Google’s operating system doesn’t come with Maps or Assistant included. To access one of those services, automakers must purchase a bundle that includes all of them. Warren argues that tactic allows Google to leverage its dominant position in one area to obtain market share in another. In this specific case, she suggests the company is using Maps to grow Assistant.</p><p>“These tactics are reminiscent of past Big Tech bundling controversies,” Warren states, drawing a parallel to cases like the Justice Department’s 2001 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/internet-explorer-25-133058478.html"><ins>lawsuit against Microsoft</ins></a>. Apple and Amazon did not immediately respond to Engadget’s request for comment. “Carmakers choose to partner with tech companies to improve the experience for their customers,” a Google spokesperson told Engadget. "There is enormous competition in the connected car space – including Apple CarPlay, Amazon Alexa, Cerence, TomTom, ChargePoint and many others – and carmakers continue to invest in their in-house solutions simultaneously. At Google, our goal is to enable carmakers and developers across the auto industry to develop software solutions at scale.”</p><p>As <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/23434586/elizabeth-warren-apple-google-amazon-cars"><em>Vox </em>points out</a>, automakers are partly to blame for the current state of the market. One reason platforms like CarPlay and Android Auto are so popular is that first-party options from car companies have historically failed to meet consumer expectations. In 2019, Ford <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ford-17-million-myford-touch-lawsuit-settlement/"><ins>paid $17 million</ins></a> to settle a class-action lawsuit related to its MyFord Touch infotainment system. The platform was known for freezing and crashing while in use.</p><p>Warren says ensuring there’s fair competition in the automotive sector should be a priority for the FTC and DOJ. “The FTC and DOJ don’t have to wait until there’s a problem to take action,” she writes. “Now is the time to prevent Big Tech from strangling competition in the automotive industry before it’s too late.”</p>

## Listen to an AI sing an uncannily human rendition of 'Jolene'

<p>AI-powered image generators have been getting most of the press recently. But musical machine learning models have quietly been making great strides in recent years. Holly Herndon has been at the forefront of that revolution. She co-developed (along with partner Mat Dryhurst) Spawn, a singing neural network, for her last album <a href="https://www.hollyherndon.com/proto"><em>Proto</em></a> and released <a href="https://holly.plus/">Holly+</a> (in partnership with <a href="https://heardsounds.com/">Never Before Heard Sounds</a>) to the public last year, which allows anyone to use a model of Holly's voice. Now she's released a new single, where the only vocals come her digital twin.</p><p>This cover of Dolly Parton's "Jolene" plays it pretty straight at first listen. Yes it's slower and quieter, but Ryan Norris, who handles the instrumentation, doesn't take any extreme liberties with the arrangement or sound palette. It simply swaps frantic desperation with plaintive resignation.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="f0668d3681144faba9b694774fce358e"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>What makes it so arresting is that every vocal sound, right down to the sharp inhales before the harmonies kick in, was generated by Holly+. (That's right, it "breathes".) There isn't a human in sight of a vocal booth here. Some of the phrasing is a little stilted and there are occasional digital artifacts, if you listen closely for them. But on the whole this digital model of the real Holly Herndon's voice is impressive in its ability to imitate its creator.</p><p>Until now, most <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-17-bjork-and-microsoft-ai-sky-music.html">major artists</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-17-arca-ai-soundtrack-for-nyc-moma.html">experimentations with AI</a> have focused on creating generative soundscapes or synth melodies. This is (as far as I know) the first time a machine learning model has taken the mic solo in a pop song.&nbsp;</p><p>Herndon previewed the track way back in March at <a href="https://youtu.be/Wk6T2WmhuJw">Sonar Festival</a>, but it largely flew under the radar until it received a proper release this week. (BTW: Go watch the presentation from Sonar for some truly wild real-time demonstrations of Holly+ and Never Before Heard Sounds' technology.) You can attempt to recreate the performance above by recording your own performance of Jolene and uploading it to Holly+, but don't expect the same fidelity of results through the web app. While it's definitely a fun diversion, artists who are serious about using AI to further their craft should explore <a href="https://spawning.ai/About">Spawning</a>, an organization launched by Herdon and Dryhurst earlier this year.</p>

## A swarm of 500 drones will plague New York City with advertising tomorrow

<p>New Yorkers are used to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-17-google-pixel-4-coral-times-square-ad.html">ads dotting the landscape</a>, but now they can't even look to the skies for refuge. As <em>Gothamist</em><a href="https://gothamist.com/news/500-drones-to-swarm-nycs-skyline-thursday-in-new-advertising-ploy">reports</a>, mobile developer King and show organizer Pixis are flying a swarm of at least 500 LED-equipped drones over New York City's skyline on November 3rd to advertise <em>Candy Crush</em>. They'll take off from and remain in New Jersey for the 10-minute presentation, but you'll spot them if you're within a one-mile radius of Battery Park.</p><p>This isn't the first drone light show aimed at NYC. In June, Pixis orchestrated a swarm that promoted the NBA draft by flying over the Hudson River. Company general manager Jeff Kaplan characterizes the <em>Candy Crush</em> promo as the "next wave," however, and it's safe to say this will be hard to avoid if you're in the area. The largest drone show to date came from Hyundai's Genesis brand, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/genesis-breaks-drone-world-record-214420405.html">flew 3,281 drones</a> over Shanghai in March 2021.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Pixis is jumping over multiple legal hurdles to make the campaign happen. New York City's Avigation Law bans drone flights altogether, so any aerial sales pitches have to remain within New Jersey's borders. The company also had to obtain both a Federal Aviation Administration waiver (to fly in federal airspace) and a special permit from New Jersey (to operate from Liberty State Park).</p><p>The planned flight is already angering critics. New York State Senator Brad Hoylman, for instance, says it's "outrageous" to fill the sky with drones and is considering legislation to ban such ads. New York City's Audubon is also concerned the drones might interfere with bird flight patterns. There is a history of crackdowns on this kind of behavior — both the state and city kicked out a billboard-carrying boat in 2019.</p><p>Unless that happens, though, the drones will become harder to escape. A future robotic flier will be viewable within 3 miles, potentially covering a large swath of Manhattan and even significant parts of western Brooklyn. Like it or not, these tech-driven marketing spiels may soon be difficult for NYC residents to escape.</p>

<p>Say hello to Xumo, the new branding for Comcast and Charter's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/charter-comcast-streaming-platform-150154177.html">recently announced joint streaming venture</a>. It's an evolution of the previous Xumo, the ad-supported streaming service <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-25-comcast-acquires-xumo.html">Comcast bought two years ago</a>, that's aiming to be "an entire entertainment ecosystem inclusive of streaming devices, content, and a platform for partners to reach audiences at scale," according to the companies. Comcast's Flex streaming device will now be called Xumo Stream Box, while XClass TV, the company's push to bring its technology into Hisense-made televisions, will be rebadged as Xumo TV. You can expect to see the first Xumo devices distributed by Charter, Comcast and Walmart next year.</p><p>While it may seem a bit late to launch an entirely new streaming company, the joint initiative could be a smart way for Comcast and Charter to modernize their technology and reach consumers outside of their normal regions. The focus on free, ad-supported content (or FAST, in industry terms), is also a clear shot against Roku's offerings. Even though we're being inundated with increasingly expensive streaming services, it turns out many people don't mind watching a few ads to see some of their favorite shows. And that's easy money for any company offering ad-based content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Workers at an Apple Store in Glasgow, Scotland, voted on Wednesday to unionize. The vote came after “several” months of negotiations that eventually saw Apple agree to recognize the ballot voluntarily. According to <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/business_hq/23094915.scottish-apple-store-staff-become-first-uk-unionise/"><em>The Herald</em></a>, employees at the company’s Buchanan Street location, one of two stores Apple operates in Scotland’s most populous city, voted “overwhelmingly” in favor of joining the GMB Union. With the historic vote, the retail location is now on track to become the first unionized Apple Store in the United Kingdom.</p><p>Apple did not immediately respond to Engadget’s request for comment. “We have long been committed to providing an excellent experience for our customers and teams,” the company told <em>The Herald</em>.

In October, the National Labor Relations Board <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-nlrb-anti-union-complaint-160802668.html">issued a complaint</a> against the company, saying it had found merit in claims from the Communications Workers of America. The union accused Apple of interrogating staff at its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-store-world-trade-center-union-busting-complaint-060937009.html">World Trade Center</a> store in New York City and subjecting them to mandatory anti-union meetings.

But Musk’s path from Twitter super-user to Twitter owner and CEO was anything but straightforward.</p><p>While he’s long been known as a prolific tweeter, it was a surprise to most that he was interested in exterting an even bigger influence on the platform. After quietly acquiring a majority stake in the company, he offered to buy the whole thing — even though it wasn’t for sale.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="13b76b3bc343448c894f62a92f8ef897"></div><p>Twitter’s board seemed hesitant at first, but Musk’s money was hard to turn down. In a matter of days, the company agreed to alter its path entirely. Then Musk changed his mind… multiple times. First, the deal was “on hold.” Then, he wanted out entirely. Twitter sued, kicking off a massive legal battle in a Delaware court. But just before the trial was scheduled to begin, Musk said he would honor the deal after all.</p><p>Now, there are fresh questions about what exactly Twitter will look like under Musk. He’s proposed numerous changes, including changing Twitter’s moderation rules and reversing permanent bans. He also has a new plan to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-price-increasing-8-per-month-180319987.html">charge for verification</a>. These decisions are only just beginning to play out, but have already caused massive upheaval both within the company and on the platform itself. Watch the video above for the full story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-07-google-flood-forecasting-india-monsoon-ai.html"><ins>For the last several years,</ins></a> Google has been using artificial intelligence to develop a system that can predict floods. It has also been working on wildfire tracking tools. Ahead of the COP27 climate conference taking place next week, the company announced that it is expanding those tools.</p><p>First, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google"><ins>Google</ins></a> says it will offer flood forecasts for river basins in another 18 countries. Those are Brazil, Colombia, Sri Lanka, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Guinea, Malawi, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Angola, South Sudan, Namibia, Liberia and South Africa. The company previously offered flood warnings to users in India and Bangaldesh with alerts on Android devices and phones that have the Google Search app installed.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google is also making a tool called <a href="http://g.co/floodhub"><ins>Flood Hub</ins></a> available worldwide. Flood Hub displays flood forecasts on a map and shows when and where they might occur with color-coded pins. The company hopes the tool will help people who are directly at risk from the impacts of flooding, and that it will assist organizations and governments in mobilizing their responses.</p><p>"This expansion in geographic coverage is possible thanks to our recent breakthroughs in AI-based flood forecasting models, and we’re committed to expanding to more countries," Yossi Matias, Google vice president of engineering and crisis response lead, <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/cop27-adaptation-efforts/"><ins>wrote in a blog post</ins></a>. Matias noted that catastrophic flood damage affects more than 250 million people every year. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/un-emissions-gap-report-climate-change-warning-144323723.html"><ins>Global warming</ins></a> is likely to result in more flooding, which makes detection systems such as the one Google is working on critical.</p><p>Using weather forecast data, the company is able to offer flood warnings up to a week in advance, senior staff engineering manager Sella Nevo told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/2/23434777/google-wildfire-flood-tracking-expands-floodhub-app"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>. The AI model previously used water level gauge data, which limited the advance warning window to around 48 hours.</p><p>As for wildfires, Matias wrote that Google detects "wildfire boundaries using new AI models based on satellite imagery and [shows] their real-time location in Search and Maps." The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-wildfire-tracking-worldwide-170837067.html"><ins>said last year</ins></a> that it would make its wildfire tracking tool available worldwide. It's now using machine learning to improve wildfire detection and monitoring. Initially, the improved tracking tools are available in the US, Mexico, Canada and some areas of Australia. The company also uses data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA satellites for wildfire tracking.</p><p>Matias also touched on some of the other work Google and parent company Alphabet are doing to mitigate climate change, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ai-traffic-lights-research-environment-pollution-070132356.html"><ins>an AI-powered system</ins></a> to make traffic lights more efficient and reduce pollution from idling cars. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alphabet-x-mineral-223517153.html"><ins>Mineral</ins></a>, a project housed under Alphabet's X moonshot division, is attempting to make the global food system more sustainable and productive.</p>

<p>When we put together our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smartphones-140004900.html">ultimate list</a> of current-model smartphones, Samsung's <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TQU1TVU5HLVNtYXJ0cGhvbmUtVW5sb2NrZWQtQnJpZ2h0ZXN0LVByb2Nlc3Nvci9kcC9CMDlNVlpINVJCP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTJ2LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNDkzYThkMC1iZjE5LTQxMGItOWU1MS0wYzI1ZWYwOTA0Y2UifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZEZMTK9ZdP5IyYC4jP_8aYzScMhGvHT5vPTHNETu3D7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Brightest-Processor%2Fdp%2FB09MVZH5RB">Galaxy S22 Ultra</a> easily won out as the best Android option. It's on sale at Amazon right now for $300 off the list price, bringing it down to just $900. That's only ten bucks more than its lowest ever price during October's Prime Day — still a strong deal. We deemed the S22 Ultra "an excellent phone and the best premium Android flagship you can buy," before awarding it a solid <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review-s-pen-camera-samples-battery-life-160019240.html">score of 89</a>. And because Samsung has promised at least four years of updates/support, its an investment that won't leave your phone high and dry in just a couple years.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Those who remember Samsung's Note series will find a lot that feels familiar here, especially the S Pen, the on-board stylus that lets you jot notes, mark up photos, draw doodles and use it as a cursor. In fact, the S Pen is part of what differentiates the S22 Ultra from the S22+ and the S22, as neither of the latter include the stylus.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The S22 Ultra also offers a bigger camera setup, larger screen and longer battery life than its less-premium siblings. The Ultra's cameras include a 108-megapixel main sensor, a 12-MP ultrawide option and a pair of 10-MP telephoto lenses. And while there's a new Adaptive Pixel feature intended to capture more light and make images clearer, we didn't find a huge difference in our tests. That said, the S22 Ultra photos held their own against those from comparable phones made by Apple and Google.</p><p>The huge 6.8-inch 120Hz OLED screen is smooth, quick and colorful (in fact, we called it "sumptuous"). In our battery tests, we got 17 hours and 16 minutes in a video rundown, which does happen to be a shorter lifespan than its predecessor, the Ultra S21 — an issue that may have to do with the fact that the S Pen draws power, even while stowed in its slot.&nbsp;</p><p>The tough exterior has an IP68 dust and water resistance rating — meaning it can handle a dunk in five feet of water for up to 30 minutes — and the display is wrapped in the latest Victus+ Gorilla Glass for improved crack- and scratch-resistance (it survived a dive off the top of a cabinet in our review and came out unscathed).&nbsp;</p><p>The $300 off deal applies to all three storage sizes, the 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB options. If you've been eyeing Samsung's flagship premium Android, with all the features power users could need, this is a good time to buy.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>

<p>Following <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-release-date-hbo-max-153717300.html">a slip-up</a>, HBO has <a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-original-drama-series-last-us-debuts-january-15">confirmed</a> a release date for its long-expected <em>The Last of Us</em> TV series. The video game adaptation will debut through HBO and HBO Max on January 15th at 9PM Eastern. You'll have something to watch while you wait for <em>Succession</em>, then, although you may want to pace yourself when there are 10 episodes in this initial season.</p><p>As you're likely aware by this stage, <em>The Last of Us</em> stars <em>The Mandalorian</em>'s Pedro Pascal as cynical survivor Joel and <em>Game of Thrones</em>' Bella Ramsey as Ellie, the teen Joel has to smuggle out of a quarantine zone 20 years after a fungal zombie plague wrecks civilization. Big names like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nick-offerman-the-last-of-us-hbo-164105965.html">Nick Offerman</a>, Gabriel Luna and Anna Torv also star, while game voice actors Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker also make appearances.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="1bb4901a4e66456bb7e777a2120e4857"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">To the edge of the universe and back. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheLastOfUs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheLastOfUs</a> premieres January 15 on <a href="https://twitter.com/hbomax?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@HBOMax</a>. <a href="https://t.co/TPJxOBZRBr">pic.twitter.com/TPJxOBZRBr</a></p>— The Last of Us (@TheLastofUsHBO) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheLastofUsHBO/status/1587836936512839680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>The show is expected to largely follow the plot of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-part-1-gameplay-design-interview-160017228.html">original game</a>, with Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann serving as writer and executive producer alongside <em>Chernobyl</em>'s Craig Mazin. Unlike many <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2022-m2-review-140026198-140026510-140026377-140026181.html">game-based productions</a>, <em>The Last of Us</em> will have both the creative input of the developer <em>and</em> critically acclaimed talent behind the cameras. It's just a question of whether or not that combination works in practice, especially for newcomers who aren't attached to the story.</p>

## Etsy adds image-based search, but only on iOS for now

<p>Etsy has <a href="https://www.etsy.com/news/cant-describe-what-youre-looking-for-search-with-images-instead-dupe?ref=news"><ins>begun testing visual search</ins></a>. The company suggests the feature is ideal for those situations where you’re not quite sure how to describe something. Whereas in the past you had to rely on keywords and a bit of luck, you can now tap the new camera icon in the search bar and snap a photo of a product in hopes of finding similar items.</p><p>In my testing, the feature works surprisingly well. I first took a photo of my keyboard, a Drop Ctrl with GMK <a href="https://kono.store/products/gmk-rainy-day"><ins>Rainy Day</ins></a> keycaps. Not only did the app return with suggestions for keycaps, but it also narrowed in on ones that featured gray and blue tones like my set. I then snapped a photo of an artwork in my office I bought from a local Toronto artist. Etsy’s software successfully identified the piece as a line drawing and pointed me to stylistically similar artworks. I need to use the feature more to get a better sense of its limitations, but it does feel that it could be useful in exactly the way Etsy envisions it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can experiment with visual search on your own starting today if you have access to an iOS device. According to Etsy, the feature will soon come to Android.</p><figure><img alt="Etsy visual search" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/56c232c0-5ac8-11ed-bf6d-bbaec66796df" style="height: 1080; width: 536;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Etsy</div></figure><p></p>

## Tidal finally adds proper playlist sharing

<p>Tidal has already been closing gaps with the competition by adding <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tidal-free-streaming-plan-artist-paymetns-royalties-153606001.html">a free tier</a> and similar upgrades, but its latest improvement may be one of the most important. The streaming music service has finally <a href="https://support.tidal.com/hc/en-us/articles/10177158714769-My-Profile-at-TIDAL">introduced</a> user profiles that let you easily share your playlists. Make a playlist public and Tidal users can discover your musical tastes through search, or share that track listing through links. You could technically share before, but it was much more difficult until now.</p><p>Profiles (and thus playlist sharing) are available now through Tidal's Android, iOS, desktop and web apps. They replace the "My Collection" saved content section in the mobile app. Don't worry about having to start from scratch — your existing saved material will still be available after you create a profile.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tidal is free to use with ads, although it's limited to a 160Kbps bitrate and doesn't support offline tracks or unlimited skips. Pay $10 per month for Tidal HiFi and you'll remove the ads and restrictions while jumping to a much higher 1,411Kbps quality. At $20 per month, the HiFi Plus plan offers "master quality" 9,216Kbps audio for some songs and direct payouts to the artists you listen to most often.</p><p>The addition is arguably overdue when Apple Music, Spotify and other services have had playlist sharing for years. This might not do much to help Tidal grow beyond a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/spotify-subscription-numbers-up-youtube-music-tidal/">small slice</a> of the market. However, you might have a stronger incentive to stick around. The feature will not only let you see what your friends enjoy, but might help you find a new running mix or workday soundtrack.</p>

## Former Apple employee admits to defrauding the company out of $17 million

<p>A former <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple/"><ins>Apple</ins></a> employee has pled guilty to defrauding the company out of over $17 million. Dhirendra Prasad, who spent most of his decade at Apple working as a buyer in the Global Service Supply Chain department, admitted to "taking kickbacks, inflating invoices, stealing parts and causing Apple to pay for items and services never received,” <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/former-apple-employee-admits-defrauding-apple-more-17-million"><ins>according to the US Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California</ins></a>. Prasad started these schemes in 2011 and continued them until 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>In one scam, Prasad shipped motherboards from Apple's inventory to CTrends, a company run by a co-conspirator, Don M. Baker (who previously admitted to taking part in the fraudulent schemes). Baker harvested components from the motherboards, then Prasad organized purchase orders for those parts. After Baker shipped the components back to Apple, CTrends filed invoices for which Prasad arranged payment. In the end, the pair got Apple to pay for its own components and they split the proceeds of the scam.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to fleecing Apple, Prasad confessed to engaging in tax fraud. He directed payments from Robert Gary Hansen (another co-conspirator who has admitted to taking part in the schemes) straight to his creditors. In addition, Prasad arranged for a shell company to send sham invoices to CTrends with the aim of covering up illicit payments Baker made to him. This enabled Baker "to claim hundreds of thousands of dollars of unjustified tax deductions," the US Attorney's Office said. All told, prosecutors claim that the scams resulted in the IRS losing over $1.8 million.</p><p>Prasad will be sentenced in March. He pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and wire fraud, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years. Prasad also pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, which has a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment. Moreover, Prasad agreed to forfeit around $5 million worth of assets he accrued as a result of his criminal actions, including real estate properties.</p>

The good news is, companies are still making a ton of new laptops, and there are plenty of models for you to choose from the budget HP Pavilion Aero 13 to the convertible Microsoft Surface Pro 9 to our best overall pick of the Apple MacBook Air M2. We've made it less complicated for you to pick out the best laptop for your needs.</p><h2>Engadget's picks</h2><ul><li><p>Best overall: <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLUFwcGxlLU1hY0Jvb2stTGFwdG9wLWNoaXAvZHAvQjBCM0JWV0o2WS8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMnItMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk5YTdmYjA4LWI0Y2ItMzU5OC04OTBjLTZmNmQ4NzgzMzliMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUqS6KibBIOnjTS_t0uCcwZrLnd7hGBpsxxKybHVdU-6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F2022-Apple-MacBook-Laptop-chip%2Fdp%2FB0B3BVWJ6Y%2F">MacBook Air M2</a></p></li><li><p>Best Windows: <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b1bb23c9-a2d4-4e4e-bfac-7a560ebe7641&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dell&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiMWJiMjNjOS1hMmQ0LTRlNGUtYmZhYy03YTU2MGViZTc2NDEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVsbC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2hvcC9kZWxsLWxhcHRvcHMveHBzLTEzLXBsdXMtbGFwdG9wL3NwZC94cHMtMTMtOTMyMC1sYXB0b3AveG45MzIwY3RvMDIwcyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTlhN2ZiMDgtYjRjYi0zNTk4LTg5MGMtNmY2ZDg3ODMzOWIxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdtfaIOzhpL4OnNN_QW15c2ckpfoKACaswmr_O89Y8Sw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fxps-13-plus-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9320-laptop%2Fxn9320cto020s">Dell XPS 13 Plus</a></p></li><li><p>Best for gaming: <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=358591a8-2981-451c-a839-e645b5522820&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Razer+Online+Store&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNTg1OTFhOC0yOTgxLTQ1MWMtYTgzOS1lNjQ1YjU1MjI4MjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmF6ZXIuY29tL2dhbWluZy1sYXB0b3BzL3JhemVyLWJsYWRlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5OWE3ZmIwOC1iNGNiLTM1OTgtODkwYy02ZjZkODc4MzM5YjEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQ9o5_n5kM7Yx-9r7dzClgNh3NKSnTuCky48XCcfasL-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2Frazer-blade">Razer Blade 15 Advanced</a></p></li><li><p>Best Chromebook: <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9MZW5vdm8tQ2hyb21lYm9vay1pMy0xMDExMFUtSW50ZWdyYXRlZC04MkI4MDAwNlVYL2RwL0IwODYzODNIQzc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMnItMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk5YTdmYjA4LWI0Y2ItMzU5OC04OTBjLTZmNmQ4NzgzMzliMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWAHbAfcsViwX1kxKQ_ynsw5wxUagEtTOKquLJxHzzYh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLenovo-Chromebook-i3-10110U-Integrated-82B80006UX%2Fdp%2FB086383HC7%3F">Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook</a></p></li><li><p>Best budget: <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8a0e8870-4cf8-4bda-935c-af7c00c28e2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=HP&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4YTBlODg3MC00Y2Y4LTRiZGEtOTM1Yy1hZjdjMDBjMjhlMmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHAuY29tL3VzLWVuL3Nob3AvbWRwL2xhcHRvcHMvaHAtcGF2aWxpb24tYWVybyN0YWI9dmFvPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTlhN2ZiMDgtYjRjYi0zNTk4LTg5MGMtNmY2ZDg3ODMzOWIxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARnOhEoOzXreWjjtj7HG2h9ng9Hvr4Fe0QhG0w3oAwKc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fmdp%2Flaptops%2Fhp-pavilion-aero%23tab%3Dvao%3F">HP Pavilion Aero 13</a></p></li><li><p>Best convertible: <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9NaWNyb3NvZnQtTGlnaHR3ZWlnaHQtUHJvY2Vzc29yLU11bHRpLVRhc2tpbmctU2FwcGhpcmUvZHAvQjBCOVE3VkRHND90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0yci0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTlhN2ZiMDgtYjRjYi0zNTk4LTg5MGMtNmY2ZDg3ODMzOWIxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYW2n8KNLzcQxKygTTIEiQ7Di3GSysCRFiKEUgFhIK-B&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMicrosoft-Lightweight-Processor-Multi-Tasking-Sapphire%2Fdp%2FB0B9Q7VDG4">Microsoft Surface Pro 9</a></p></li></ul><h2>What to expect</h2><p>You probably have an idea of your budget here, but just so you know, most laptops with top-of-the-line specs can cost you around $1,800 to $2,000 these days. That doesn’t mean you won’t find a good system for under $1,000 — a grand is the base price for a lot of premium ultraportables in the 13-inch category, with chips like Intel’s Core i3 or i5 series. And if that’s too expensive, you’ll still have respectable options in the $600 to $800 range, but they might come with older, slower processors and dimmer screens. I’ve included our favorite budget-friendly model in this best laptop roundup but we have a list of more-affordable laptops that you can check out as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After working out how much money you want to spend, the laptop’s operating system is usually the first thing you have to narrow down. As always, the decision is slightly easier for people who prefer MacBooks. Now that Apple has brought its M-series chips to its whole lineup — your only real considerations are budget, screen size and how much power you need.</p><p>Over on Team Windows, however, the shift to ARM-based chips hasn’t been as smooth. Though Apple has been able to bring huge increases in battery life while maintaining (and in some cases improving) performance with its own silicon, PC makers have been limited by Windows’ shortcomings. Microsoft released Windows 11 last year, and it’s supposed to run better on ARM-powered machines. Since the first of these laptops, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-made-its-first-think-pad-powered-by-a-snapdragon-chip-080035789.html">Lenovo’s ThinkPad X13s</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-snapdragon-windows-11-tablet-yoga-laptop-ryzen-virtual-reality-153901587.html">10w tablet</a>, haven’t been available for review yet, we can’t tell how well the system runs. Of course, you can upgrade to Windows 11 on existing ARM-based PCs, but for now, it’s still safer to stick with an Intel or AMD processor.</p><figure><img alt="Dell XPS 13" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/98e7c4a0-eb92-11ea-b3fb-e2e6726b0a03" /><figcaption>Devindra Hardawar / Engadget 
 </figcaption></figure><p>Let’s not forget there’s a third and fairly popular laptop operating system: Chrome. If you do most of your work in a browser (lots of online research, emails and Google Drive), then a Chromebook might be a suitable, and often more affordable option.</p><p>As for other things to look out for, it’s worth pointing out that a couple of laptops coming out this year are doing away with headphone jacks. Though this doesn’t seem to be a prevalent trend yet, it’s a good reminder to check that a machine has all the connectors you need. Most laptops in 2022 offer WiFi 6 or 6E and Bluetooth 5.0 or later, which should mean faster and more stable connections if you have compatible routers and devices. While 5G coverage is more widespread this year, whether you need support for that depends on how much you travel.</p><p>Where you plan on taking your laptop also helps in deciding what size to get. Many companies launched new 14-inch machines in the last year, straddling the line between ultraportable and bulkier 15-inch offerings. For most people, a 14-inch screen is a great middle ground. But if you’re worried about weight, a 12- or 13-inch model will be better. Those that want more powerful processors and larger displays will prefer 15- or 16-inch versions.</p><h2>Best overall: MacBook Air M2</h2><figure><img alt="MacBook Air (M2, 2022)" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-07/8f645890-0318-11ed-abe7-4a5445793bdd" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>As a Windows user, I find myself reluctant to name an Apple MacBook the best overall laptop.

We found it to be impressively fast, and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-review-2022-130040098.html">M2</a> only builds on top of that stellar performance. It's probably overkill for a MacBook Air, but that means it will serve most people well for both work and play. Plus, its 16.5-hour battery life should be enough for anyone to get a day's worth of work and then some.</p><p>As for its design, we like that Apple took a more uniformly thin approach here and retired the wedge shape of the previous model. The M2 Air also has a lovely 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display, interrupted only by the top notch which holds its 1080p webcam. Its quad-speaker setup is an improvement as well, and all of these small hardware changes add up to a machine that looks and feels more different than you may expect from its predecessor. However, both the M1 and M2 MacBook Air laptops remain solid machines. Considering the M2 starts at $1,199, those with tight budgets may be willing to forgo the new design improvements in order to save some cash and get a still-speedy laptop.</p><a class="athena-button rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLUFwcGxlLU1hY0Jvb2stTGFwdG9wLWNoaXAvZHAvQjBCM0JWV0o2WS8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMnMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk5YTdmYjA4LWI0Y2ItMzU5OC04OTBjLTZmNmQ4NzgzMzliMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXt6dtsjDfO1tBRSUbGv7chQNuq2ul9rPdLMhz73hl-r&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F2022-Apple-MacBook-Laptop-chip%2Fdp%2FB0B3BVWJ6Y%2F" id="36493cf0f9d047369d5fccd484e65f07">Buy MacBook Air M2 at Amazon - $1,199</a><a class="athena-button rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1NYWNCb29rLTEzLWluY2gtMjU2R0ItU3RvcmFnZS9kcC9CMDhONU03UzZLP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTJzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5OWE3ZmIwOC1iNGNiLTM1OTgtODkwYy02ZjZkODc4MzM5YjEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAU5PBiT5KkdecA8uIQXxS0vX-Tvw1zhIjdsFoNJnN3lJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage%2Fdp%2FB08N5M7S6K" id="7e5c119067b74f3784537084628779b3">Buy MacBook Air M1 at Amazon - $999</a><h2>Best Windows: Dell XPS 13 Plus</h2><figure><img alt="Dell XPS 13 Plus" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f2b36930-6d78-11ec-9bff-751fab2ef4f2" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">

The 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage may sound meager, but in our testing the Flex 5 held up in spite of this constraint. It’s also nice to see one USB-A and two USB-C ports, eight-hour battery life and a 360-degree hinge that makes it easy to use the Flex 5 as a tablet. That’s a bonus, especially now that Chrome OS supports Android apps.</p><p>Though the Flex 5 is almost two years old by now, it’s a solid deal at around $400. In fact, you can sometimes find it on sale for as little as $300, making it a great option for someone looking for a basic browser-based machine on a tight budget.</p><a class="athena-button rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9MZW5vdm8tQ2hyb21lYm9vay1pMy0xMDExMFUtSW50ZWdyYXRlZC04MkI4MDAwNlVYL2RwL0IwODYzODNIQzc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMnMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk5YTdmYjA4LWI0Y2ItMzU5OC04OTBjLTZmNmQ4NzgzMzliMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfKCWCW5PsZWQCCNVOiy2hHIfLgAPyWuIbMmCsZsziCZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLenovo-Chromebook-i3-10110U-Integrated-82B80006UX%2Fdp%2FB086383HC7%3F" id="06034706c29644e584f59b0640bb6e54">Buy Flex 5 Chromebook at Amazon - $430</a><h2>Best budget: HP Pavilion Aero 13</h2><figure><img alt="HP Pavilion Aero" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/febd5040-069b-11ec-acb7-015e810404d9" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">

Considering you'll pay at least $1,000 for any Surface Pro 9 model, you might as well get a configuration that has as few limitations as possible.</p><p>While we have our gripes about the Pro 9's overall ergonomics, it's undoubtably one of the thinnest and lightest laptop alternatives you can get. It's attractive and has a gorgeous 13-inch display, and we still consider Microsoft's Type Cover to be one of the best you can get, period. They will cost you extra, though, so be prepared to shell out another $100 to $180 for one. Microsoft's Slim Pen 2 is another highlight, and it will be a must-buy accessory for anyone that loves to draw or prefers to take handwritten notes. Overall, if you want a machine that can switch seamlessly from being a laptop to being a tablet, the Intel Surface Pro 9 is one of your best bets. Of course, if you're married to the Apple ecosystem, you should consider an iPad Pro.</p><a class="athena-button rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9NaWNyb3NvZnQtTGlnaHR3ZWlnaHQtUHJvY2Vzc29yLU11bHRpLVRhc2tpbmctU2FwcGhpcmUvZHAvQjBCOVE3VkRHND90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0ycy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTlhN2ZiMDgtYjRjYi0zNTk4LTg5MGMtNmY2ZDg3ODMzOWIxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZgkRupd6CFyBHJahTycxcU6MO_cupAv9KyRyakLHBUC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMicrosoft-Lightweight-Processor-Multi-Tasking-Sapphire%2Fdp%2FB0B9Q7VDG4" id="6781b49e126a40a4a192e4645fa89b4e">Buy Surface Pro 9 at Amazon - $1,100</a><p></p>

## The X-T5 is the first major upgrade to Fujifilm’s compact camera flagship in 5 years

<p>Fujifilm is delivering a follow-up to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-x-t4-mirrorless-camera-review-140024236.html">well-received</a> X-T4. The company has <a href="https://fujifilm-x.com/en-us/products/cameras/x-t5">introduced</a> (what else?) the X-T5, a sequel to the higher-end APS-C mirrorless camera that delivers some major technical upgrades — the largest in five years — while refining the basic formula. The new model now packs Fuji's current 40MP sensor (up from 26MP) that can shoot 6.2K video at 30 frames per second. You don't need to buy a top-tier cam like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-x-h2s-mirrorless-camera-review-123049866.html">X-H2S</a> to venture beyond 4K.  You can also expect a jump in computing power through the X-Processor 5 that allows for AI-based autofocusing, 4:2:2 10-bit output, F-log2 and support for the HEIF photo format.</p><p>The X-T5 design is also smaller, lighter and simpler than its predecessor, and moves the shutter button and front control dial for a better hold. There are some under-the-hood changes, too, including slightly better in-body stabilization (seven stops instead of 6.5), a mildly higher-resolution tilting LCD and an electronic viewfinder with 0.8X magnification instead of the X-T4's 0.75X. You'll theoretically notice improvements, then, even if the body still seems very familiar.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0e2178134b304bc58e8c71aa90c5289a"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Don't expect many other changes. There are still dual UHS-II SD card slots, a USB-C port and HDMI. The X-T5 still uses the same battery, although Fujifilm says the upgraded processor should help with power management.</p><p>Fujifilm ships the X-T5 on November 17th for $1,699 for the body alone, $2,099 with an 18-55mm lens and $2,199 with a more flexible 16-80mm lens. It's debuting alongside a $599 XF30mm f/2.8 macro lens that can focus on subjects as close as 3.9 inches from the sensor, and just 0.5 inches from the 11-element glass. In some ways, this is a return to form. Our primary gripes with the X-T4 were its not-so-compact form factor and imperfect autofocus tracking — both of those are hopefully fixed. The price still makes it costlier than rivals like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-sony-a6600-review-misstep.html">Sony's A6600</a>, but the improved performance may help justify the premium.</p>

It has a built-in plug for wall usage, but it folds down into the device when you’re not using it, keeping the whole thing pretty compact.

But the best part might be its two-year battery life; your giftee will only have to replace the mouse’s two AA batteries once in a blue moon.</p><a class="athena-button rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOUtYNjZaQ0QvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTJxLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzYjIzNmU4Yy1iNDhjLTNhOTItYWMxYi0yMTQ0NDIwYzA3OGQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAX29mbDWZPzKWEd-b_HDbpZefhU70kyoNkr3q_nlOQBY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09KX66ZCD%2F" id="177e9f9ecad94bf48519cb65db3f8832">Buy Logitech M650 mouse at Amazon - $40</a><h2>Sony PS5 Media Remote</h2><figure><img alt="Sony PS5 Media Remote" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/c43c2a60-53a5-11ed-bfd7-7b0af4ef2fa7" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>If someone you love recently got their hands on a PS5, it’s probably the only thing they care about at the moment.

The compact remote has dedicated media controls that let them easily play/pause, fast forward and otherwise navigate, along with quick-launch buttons for services like Netflix and YouTube. Those service-specific buttons even work when the console is powered off, too.

We also like that it uses GaN technology to keep it compact, but also for better heat management.</p><p>As for the cable, it’s one of Anker’s newest and it’s made out of plant-based materials rather than petroleum-based plastic like many others. While this may not seem like the most exciting gift, it’ll definitely be one of the most useful your loved one receives. Charging accessories are often things we buy at the last minute, like right before you board a plane as you remember you forgot your cable or adapter at home.

Building up a smart home ecosystem from scratch can be intimidating, but starting off with smart plugs like these is a convenient and mostly stress-free way of doing it. These blocks plug into standard wall outlets and then turn whatever they plug into them into app-controllable gadgets. That means they can set a schedule for their coffee maker to turn on at the precise time each morning so it’s ready to go for them when they need to make a new pot. They could also use Away Mode to automatically turn on and off lights when they’re on vacation to make it seem like they’re actually home.

## DJI's Mavic 3 Classic drone drops a lens in return for a lower price

<p>DJI's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-mavic-3-drone-review-cinematic-power-at-a-price-150029600.html">Mavic 3</a> is a useful cinematic drone, but its steep price ($1,899 as we write this) can be off-putting compared to the $1,449 of the older <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-23-dji-mavic-pro-2-and-mavic-2-zoom-hands-on.html">Mavic 2 Pro</a>. The company thinks it has a simple solution, though: offer a trimmed-back version. DJI has <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=479372ad-6013-4434-bdb7-ebc5486af4cc&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=DJI&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0NzkzNzJhZC02MDEzLTQ0MzQtYmRiNy1lYmM1NDg2YWY0Y2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGppLmNvbS9tYXZpYy0zLWNsYXNzaWMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjlhMGFkMDIyLTY3YTgtNDVkMS05MzM3LTg5ODE1MzJmMjAyMyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAS6ruMfxP6D2dbHxlVRnbuVU1GtwSbYn1WNpAztdTQJg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dji.com%2Fmavic-3-classic">introduced</a> the Mavic 3 Classic, a new variant that drops the telephoto lens in exchange for a better $1,469 starting price (more on that later).</p><p>The Classic otherwise includes the features that might draw you to the Mavic 3 in the first place. The centerpiece remains a 20-megapixel, 24mm-equivalent Hasselblad camera that can shoot 5.1K video up to 50 frames per second (4K at 60FPS) and capture 12-bit RAW photos. You can likewise expect a healthy 46-minute peak flight time, a range of up to 9.3 miles and an O3+ transmission system that can send 1080p 60FPS video to your remote. You're still asked to fly within line of sight, but an AirSense ADS-B receiver can warn you of nearby aircraft if you operate at higher altitudes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This still isn't a trivial expense. The base price is for the drone only, and doesn't include a remote or charger. It's meant for upgrading DJI users who have the necessary gear. Everyone else will have to pay at least $1,599 for the standard kit, which includes the charger and the basic RC-N1 remote. Spend $1,749 and you'll get the display-equipped DJI RC remote. And if you need accessories, the $649 Fly More add-on includes two batteries, a charging hub, a car charger, three pairs of quiet propellers and a convertible carrying bag.</p><p>The Mavic 3 Classic clearly isn't meant for newcomers, or even many enthusiasts. You'll want to look at the $679 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-mini-3-pro-review-130041928.html">Mini 3 Pro</a> or $999 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-air-2s-camera-drone-130053973.html">Air 2S</a> if you're on a tighter budget. However, it might represent a solid value if you care about drone camera quality but don't need long-zoom shots to create your next magnum opus.</p>

## Tumblr allows nudes again, but porn remains off-limits

<p>Tumblr changed enormously in 2018 after it started blocking all adult content, reportedly because images of child sexual abuse were posted on the website. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-31-sex-censorship-killed-internet-fosta-sesta.html">deleted tons of sex blogs</a> and communities to comply with its new rule, and its already dwindling community never quite recovered since. Now, the website has <a href="https://staff.tumblr.com/post/699744158019190784/this-is-not-a-drill-our-new-community-guidelines">updated</a> its community guidelines so that the naked human form is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/1/23435516/tumblr-porn-ban-modified-nudity-allowed-sexually-explicit-depictions-banned">once again allowed</a>. Under its new policy, users can post images and videos with nudity, as well as text with mature subject matter and sexual themes, but they still can't post visual depictions of sexually explicit acts or any content with an overt focus on genitalia.&nbsp;</p><p>In its full <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/policy/en/community">Community Guidelines page</a>, Tumblr explained that by "visual depictions," it means pictures, videos, GIFs, drawings, CGI and any other kind of visual media. Artwork considered historically significant is an exemption, so long as it's properly labeled. Content with nudity and sexual themes now allowed under the new policy will also have to be labeled so that users can filter them out.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to the continued ban on visual depictions of sexually explicit acts, users <a href="https://help.tumblr.com/hc/en-us/articles/9807936690711-Mature-Content">can't post links</a> to adult affiliate networks or anything that promotes escort or erotic services. They also aren't allowed to post images with extreme violence and gore or any kind of content that promotes pedophilia, including images of children when the "intent of the blog is sexually suggestive." Any blog that violates those rules will be removed. Tumblr also admits that the list isn't exhaustive and that further interpretation is up to the company.&nbsp;</p><p>Tumblr was one of the few sites that not only tolerated but seemingly embraced its sex worker and adult artist communities, so it caught considerable flak when, with little warning, it banned adult content four years ago. Earlier this year, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tumblr-porn-ban-settlement-algorithm-training-184739455.html">reached a settlement</a> with New York City's Commission on Human Rights, which found that the ban disproportionately impacted LGBTQ+ users. As part of the settlement terms, Tumblr had to bring in an expert to review its moderation algorithms for potential bias. In September this year, it launched Community Labels with the category "sexual themes," hinting that it was going to loosen its rules and would allow some adult content on the website again. That's exactly what happened, but it doesn't look like Tumblr is open to supporting porn communities anytime soon.&nbsp;</p><p>Matt Mullenweg, the CEO of Automattic (the company that now runs Tumblr), <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/photomatt/696629352701493248/why-go-nuts-show-nuts-doesnt-work-in-2022">explained</a> why in a post on his blog. Credit card companies are anti-porn, he wrote in the post, pointing out that they had <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/04/visa-suspends-card-payments-for-ad-purchases-on-pornhub-and-mindgeek-amid-controversy.html">cut off payments</a> for advertising on Pornhub. "App stores, particularly Apple's, are anti-porn," he continued. The website can't take a chance when most of its users are on mobile. Tumblr also has no means to ensure that individuals featured in sexually explicit content are of legal age and had consented to being pictured or filmed. "I agree with 'go nuts, show nuts' in principle," he said, "but the casually porn-friendly era of the early internet is currently impossible."</p>

## The Morning After: Is the M2 iPad Pro any good?

<p>What’s stopping me (or you) getting an iPad Pro? The cost, for one. And a belief that anything I’d want to use an iPad for, I can already do with my eighth-generation vanilla model. That said, Nathan Ingraham’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2022-m2-review-140026198-140026510-140026377.html"><ins>review of the M2 iPad Pro</ins></a> did make me check if my bank balance could sustain the purchase. It can’t.</p><p>Apple’s top-end iPad hasn’t changed much since last year, with the same compromises around displays evident if you get the smaller model. In fact, aside from the M2, it’s pretty much the same as before, for better and, occasionally, worse. The major changes are all enabled by the even brawnier silicon inside that chassis.</p><p>That includes Stage Manager, the multitasking setup Apple hopes will unlock the iPad’s clearly hidden potential. Certainly, the system has not been warmly received by all iPad users, and Nathan found it lacking the usual level of elegance. Oh, and you can now shoot video in ProRes 4K at 30 fps. Useful?

## Google is shutting down its dedicated Street View app

<p>You can add the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-03-google-street-view-app-theta.html">standalone Street View app</a> to Google's growing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-18-remember-softwares-dearly-departed-with-product-graveyard.html">product graveyard</a>. Upon decompiling the latest version of the application for Android, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/11/01/google-street-view-app-shutting-down/"><em>9to5Google</em></a> found shutdown notices that the company has yet to publish. In those notices, the tech giant is announcing that the Street View app is going away and that support will end on March 21st, 2023. Spokesperson Madison Gouveia has confirmed to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/1/23435733/google-maps-street-view-standalone-app-discontinue-support"><em>The Verge</em></a> that the app truly is getting the ax. Gouveia also told the publication that Google will pull Street View from app stores in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>Google announced that it was spinning off Street View into its own app back in 2015. Available for both Android and iOS, it lets you upload your own spherical photos from your phone or from spherical cameras. Last year, the company also introduced Photo Paths, which lets you contribute a series of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-now-lets-you-capture-your-own-street-view-images-131037484.html">2D photos</a> for roads and locations that haven't been documented by a Street View car (or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-10-08-google-street-view-liwa-desert.html">camel</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-07-13-faroe-islands-google-sheep-view-360.html">sheep</a>) in the past.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Street View will continue being a key Google Maps feature, so you can still virtually explore all the places the tech giant had documented with its cameras. You can also keep adding Photo Spheres within Maps and publishing 360-degree videos using Street View Studio. As <em>9to5Google</em> notes, though, there will be no way to add Photo Paths anymore after Google completely shuts down the dedicated Street View app. Previously submitted Photo Path images, however, will continue being viewable within Google Maps.&nbsp;</p>

## Google revamps Assistant parental controls and adds a kids' dictionary

<p>Kids love to use smart speakers, but it's all too easy for things to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-08-amazon-echo-attempted-spending-spree.html">go horribly wrong</a> — including content that's decidedly not family-friendly. <a href="https://blog.google/">Google</a> is trying to address those worries by both revising parental controls for Assistant and providing more child-oriented responses. To start, an update will let you disable some Assistant features, restrict the services children can use and establish downtime hours. You can bar kids from making calls, or limit them to watching YouTube Kids on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-review-sleep-tracking-radar-price-specs-130026942.html">Nest Hub</a>.</p><p>The controls will be available in the "coming weeks" through the Google Assistant, Google Home and Family Link apps for Android and iOS. They'll be available in the Assistant settings for your child's account.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google is simultaneously encouraging kids to ask more questions. It's adding a "Kids Dictionary" to Assistant that provides age-suitable answers on speakers, displays and mobile devices. If your young one asks what a telescope is, for instance, you'll get a simple explanation rather than discussions of optics and electromagnetic radiation. There are also four new "kid-friendly" voices that are slower, more expressive and otherwise better-matched to childhood development.</p><p>Google is relatively late to these kinds of features. Amazon's Alexa has had parental controls <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alexa-reading-sidekick-140006613.html">for a while</a>, and can help kids read stories. Even so, this is good news if you've wanted more choice in kid-oriented smart speakers and displays. You can likely get the device that meets your grown-up needs without worrying quite so much about your little ones.</p>

## Xiaomi's latest concept phone has an interchangeable Leica M lens

<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-12s-ultra-leica-one-inch-sensor-130451208.html">Xiaomi 12S Ultra</a> surprised us with its 1-inch camera sensor and Leica co-branding back in July, but it turns out that the Chinese brand was working on something far more ambitious at the same time. Earlier today, the "Xiaomi 12S Ultra Concept Phone" was unveiled with an appearance almost identical to the namesake flagship device, but with a <em>second</em> 1-inch 50.3-megapixel sensor occupying the middle of the camera island instead. Let that sink in for a bit. Not only that, but this new sensor is designed to work with an interchangeable Leica M lens.</p><div id="4d14aa16672d4a4c90986648ddca5a24"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Here's <a href="https://twitter.com/Xiaomi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Xiaomi</a>'s promo video for the wild "12S Ultra Concept Phone," which can mount any interchangeable <a href="https://twitter.com/leica_camera?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@leica_camera</a> M lens over its *second* 1-inch sensor.

While this would protect the sensor against dust and larger foreign objects, we do wonder how this extra layer of glass would affect the overall optical transmittance. But hey, better safe than sorry.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile, the 48-megapixel ultra-wide camera that was originally positioned in the middle of the camera island has been shifted to the side, taking up the space that once housed a 48-megapixel periscopic telephoto camera.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/0f5cadd0-5a7c-11ed-a75f-0d0cd47a1f39" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Agatha Tang</div></figure><p>As shown in Xiaomi's video, in order to install an interchangeable lens onto this 5G concept phone, you must first unscrew the protection ring around the rear camera island, then by way of an adapter, you'll be able to mount any Leica M lens. As captured by a Xiaomi staffer in the above photo, the full assembly with a Leica Summilux-M 35mm f/1.4 ASPH lens looks rather impressive from the side. Previously, the closest thing to this intriguing combination would be one of those <a href="https://petapixel.com/2021/07/10/yongnuo-yn455-a-new-android-powered-m43-mirrorless-camera/">Yongnuo</a> 4G-connected Android cameras (which never left China).

All we know is that this project was developed alongside the actual 12S Ultra, and in the end, only 10 units of the former were made. A few of those samples were seeded to some lucky influencers for some quick hands-on time, but with each unit costing around 300,000 yuan or about $41,210 to make, they better not drop them.</p><div id="3d33213d92e649ba8861315f0b31f019"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Phone📱?

## T-Mobile will start charging a $35 fee on all new activations and upgrades

<p>T-Mobile may be joining rivals Verizon and AT&amp;T by introducing an $35 charge for all new postpaid activations and upgrades, according to <a href="https://tmo.report/2022/10/t-mobile-will-force-a-new-35-activation-fee-on-nearly-every-transaction/"><em>The T-Mo Report</em></a> and some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/yijmbw/i_will_just_leave_this_here/">Redditors</a>. According to T-Mobile internal documents, it's introducing a "Device Connection Charge" for "all activations and upgrades for mobile, Beyond the Smartphone and broadband devices."</p><p>Before, the Uncarrier charged activation fees only if you received in-store customer support for new activations, with online orders exempt. Now, all new postpaid activations are charged, whether or not you were assisted. This includes updating to a new device, adding a Bring-Your-Own-Device line, or ordering a Home Internet line, according to <em>The T-Mo Report</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>T-Mobile has always tried to separate itself from regular telecoms, but charging customers for essentially nothing doesn't sound very Uncarrier-like, if the reports are accurate. And you can't take your business to Sprint, as it no longer exists thanks to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-t-mobile-completes-sprint-merger.html">merger with T-Mobile</a>.  When that deal was finalized, T-Mobile said things would be "<a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/brand/t-mobile-sprint-merger-updates">better for customers</a>," but constant activation charges would definitely not be better.</p><p>Worse, it appears to be justifying the new fee in a dubious way, saying it's "simplifying" the system to bring a "more consistent and straightforward experience for customers." In other words, you'll no longer need to wonder if you'll get soaked for the charge or not — you definitely will. Engadget has reached out to T-Mobile to confirm the report's accuracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

## Google Hangouts is well and truly dead

<p>Google has laid Hangouts to rest, a couple of years after it first announced that it was going to push people <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-will-make-chat-app-free-2021-185953374.html">to use Chat</a>, its Slack-like app, instead. After allowing users to move to Chat on their own in 2021, Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-hangouts-shutting-down-november-2022-190051422.html">phased out the Hangouts Chat app</a> for Android and iOS in July. Users were shown a prompt telling them that "Hangouts has been replaced by Google Chat" and to switch to either the standalone Chat app or the Chat experience within Gmail. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/01/google-puts-an-end-to-google-hangouts-once-and-for-all/?tpcc=tcplustwitter"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> notes, the last version of the messaging service, Hangouts for the web, is now also going away for good.</p><p>When users access the <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">Hangouts website</a>, they might see a message that says: "Starting November 1, 2022, Hangouts on the web will redirect to Chat on Web. We recommend moving to Chat now." We can still access the website without being automatically redirected, but there's a link to Google Chat that we can click to load the new messaging experience. The website might completely disappear in the coming days.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Chat used to be one of Google's business offerings before the company switched up its messaging strategy and made it available to everyone. The company says Chat "opens up new and better ways" to collaborate with features that weren't available on Hangouts. Users can edit Docs, Slides or Sheets side-by-side within Chat. Teams at work or groups of friends can also work on documents and manage tasks using Spaces, which is a dedicated place they can use for topic-based collaboration. And since Gmail features Chat integration, people can easily access conversations without having to open the Chat website.&nbsp;</p><p>Google previously said that those who want to keep a copy of their Hangouts data will have to use its <a href="https://takeout.google.com/">Takeout tool</a> before the service is gone for good. We still see Hangouts on Takeout, so those who want to do some last-minute data-saving may want to do so now while it's still possible.</p>

## Canon R6-II hands-on: Faster, more resolution and reduced heating issues

It also offers improved low-light sensitivity despite the slightly smaller pixels. And Canon says that rolling shutter is reduced over the R6.</p><p>The R6 features some changes on the outside as well. The power/lock/off switch is now positioned at the right where it’s easier to access yet harder to hit by accident. It also has a new video/photo mode switch that keeps those functions, and all their settings, separate. Flipping it also changes the menus, and Canon has introduced a convenient video-specific Q menu.</p><figure><img alt="Canon EOS R6 Mark II mirrorless camera hands-on" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/f7f04cb0-5a44-11ed-bf5e-895c8df09121" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Otherwise, it's roughly the same weight and size as the R6, and has an identical grip, menus, control layout and handling. It also uses its predecessor's, nice flip-out display for vlogging or selfies, dual UHS II card slots and 3.67-million-dot electronic viewfinder. And, of course, it comes with microphone and headphone ports, along with a USB-C socket and (unfortunately) a microHDMI jack. It has a new in-body stabilization (IBS) system, but it offers the same 8 stops of shake reduction as the EOS R6.</p><p>The battery is identical, too, but Canon has boosted efficiency, from 510 shots max on the R6 to 760 on the R6 Mark II. In one day, I shot over 2,000 photos without changing the battery, mostly using the mechanical shutter – quite impressive.</p><h2>Performance and image quality</h2><p>Mechanical shutter bursts speeds are unchanged at 12fps (RAW, full-frame), which is good considering the extra resolution. However, you can now fire RAW shots in silent mode at an exuberant 40 fps. What’s more, the R6 II now comes with a pre-shooting option (RAW burst) that captures RAW files for a half second before you push the shutter. That lets you catch a moment even if you react slowly, albeit at the expense of some battery life. When trying the feature, I found that it perhaps let me capture a few shots (out of thousands) that I might’ve missed otherwise.</p><figure><img alt="Canon R6-II Hands-on: Faster, more resolution and reduced heating issues" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/7ad44b90-5a45-11ed-b2f7-893c2f2b0462" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Those speeds are superb, but if photos are marred by excessive rolling shutter (hello Sony), they aren’t that useful. Luckily, rolling shutter is present but better controlled than on the R6, and much less severe than I saw on the A7 IV. It can take a fairly large number of shots (about 70-75 uncompressed RAW files, or 140 compressed RAWs) before the buffer fills, and it resets fairly quickly with fast UHS-II V90 cards. Still, it would have been nice to see a CFexpress slot for faster shooting and better quality video files.</p><p>The autofocus on the R6 II is more advanced than any Canon model to date, including the R3, the company says. It now handles people, animals and vehicles, including motorcycles, cars, trains and horses. And it now has an auto-select option that lets the AI decide what to track, which should be a requirement on every mirrorless camera.</p><p>The AI smoothly tracked my subject’s eyes, but it occasionally got lost and wasn’t quite up to Sony’s high standards. In regular spot continuous mode (no AI), the autofocus seemed as accurate as the R6, nailing shots in most circumstances. It was occasionally confused by the background or close subjects, but again, this was a prototype unit; these issues could be improved by the December release date.</p><p>Image quality is also hard to judge at this point, as RAW files aren’t yet ready to be seen. But JPEG files looked great, with usual Canon-like warm skin tones and accurate hues. Low-light capability was surprisingly solid, with noise well-controlled at ISO 6400 and even beyond.</p><h2>Video</h2><p>My biggest issue with the original EOS R6 was video, and specifically the overheating issues. That model could only shoot 4K 60p for 30 minutes, and only for another 10 minutes or so after it cooled enough to shoot again. Suffice to say, that’s a serious problem for professional shooters.</p><p>Those issues are effectively gone, and Canon also removed the 30-minute time limit for recording. You can now shoot 4K 60p uncropped for 40 minutes and it can normally go well beyond that. Cropped 4K 60p has a 50 minute limit, and supersampled 4K 30p has no limitations.</p><figure><img alt="Canon R6-II Hands-on: Faster, more resolution and reduced heating issues" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/4616b550-5a45-11ed-ab9d-37a950afc30f" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>It also has better video specs overall. Internally, you can shoot 4K 60 fps supersampled from a 5.1K portion of the sensor (or the full sensor width with some pixel binning). 4K at 30 fps is supersampled from 6K using the full sensor width. And it now supports 180 fps for 1080p, up from 120 fps before. Capture files are still limited to MP4 and Quicktime with no ProRes internally – likely a limitation of the UHS II cards. Like photos, there's a no pre-shooting option that captures 3 or 5 seconds of video in a loop before you push the record button.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, the camera supports 10-bit 4K video and increased dynamic range with either HDR PQ or CLog3. And you can even shoot 6K RAW to an external Atomos recorder, though that feature wasn’t ready yet for testing.</p><p>As with photos, AF for video tracks humans, animals and vehicles. In my limited testing, it performed well, only occasionally focusing on the background. So far, subject tracking isn’t quite as reliable as I saw on the A7 IV, but again, it may improve with some firmware or other tweaks.</p><p>Video was sharp and I didn’t run into any overheating issues in San Diego, where temperatures hit about 80 degrees in the sun. 1080p 180p video seems a bit soft, as it’s captured with some pixel binning, and cropped 4K also lacked sharpness compared to full-frame 4K. I was happy with the colors, and low-light video capability was good to excellent.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt="Canon R6-II Hands-on: Faster, more resolution and reduced heating issues" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/9f43d720-5a45-11ed-adfe-063ffc0cc3a0" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>By minimizing heat issues, the R6 II is already a big improvement over the original R6. But it also looks like a better camera for photography thanks to the higher resolution, faster speeds and improved image quality – with no stacked sensor required.</p><p>Canon’s entire RF ecosystem keeps getting better, too. Its latest lens is the impressive 135mm f/1.8, joining 26 other full-frame prime and zoom lenses. So, this system has become surprisingly mature, considering it only launched four years ago. I can’t give you a final evaluation for key features like image quality and autofocus, as it’s still in the prototype stage. However, we expect to revisit the Canon EOS R6 Mark II in the form of a full review once it launches in December.</p>

<p>Twitter may soon charge users $8 a month for verification, but Elon Musk reportedly plans to give all users a long-requested feature for free: the edit button. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1587590166977224705"><em><ins>Platformer’s</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>Casey Newton<em>, </em>the move is in the works alongside the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-price-increasing-8-per-month-180319987.html"><ins>more sweeping</ins></a> changes to Twitter Blue that Musk previewed Tuesday.</p><p>For now, Twitter’s edit button is only available to subscribers in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-begins-rolling-out-edit-button-in-the-united-states-171507125.html"><ins>current version</ins></a> of Twitter Blue, which costs $4.99 a month and is only live in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The feature gives users a 30-minute window to change their tweets, and includes a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-begins-rolling-out-edit-button-in-the-united-states-171507125.html"><ins>revision history.</ins></a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Musk so far hasn’t publicly talked (or tweeted) about his plans for the edit button since taking control of the company. But the feature was one of the first Twitter-related topics <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-edit-button-043143988.html"><ins>he raised</ins></a> after he first acquired a large stake in the company this spring. And Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-confirms-edit-button-214459796.html"><ins>confirmed</ins></a> it was working on the feature just hours after Musk polled his followers on whether the platform should have an edit feature. (Millions of his followers vote "yse" in <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1511143607385874434">the poll </a>— Twitter has previously said an edit button has long been its most-requested feature.)</p><p>At the same time, Musk is also planning more substantial changes to Twitter’s subscription service. He's said he qill allow anyone to get verified if they pay $8 a month, and will also show subscribers fewer ads. He’s also reportedly planning to nix the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-reportedly-plans-to-stop-offering-ad-free-articles-163505131.html"><ins>ad-free articles</ins></a> that’s currently included as perk with Twitter Blue, but wants to work with publishers to allow subscribers behind their paywalls.</p>
