Suspicion shifts and moves closer and closer to home, but on one point Chloe Okuno\u2019s film remains resolute: these characters would have avoided a lot of grief had they invested in net curtains.<br /><br />As recently as Wes Craven\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/sep/02/8\">Red Eye in 2005</a>, we could take this species of medium-budget runaround for granted.

She has punched up an underlying psychology in Zack Ford\u2019s script: the wife\u2019s mounting fears compounded by frustration at a Rational Spouse seeking to explain them away as girly misunderstanding. (Glusman\u2019s heroically regrettable moustache offers its own grounds for divorce.)</p><p>Okuno describes this gaslighting for what it is, and that permits us the rare privilege of a mainstream thriller heroine who actually errs on the side of caution throughout.

Unimprovably brisk at 91 minutes, Watcher is not messing around \u2013 and probably won\u2019t hang around long in cinemas with starry awards fare in the offing.
