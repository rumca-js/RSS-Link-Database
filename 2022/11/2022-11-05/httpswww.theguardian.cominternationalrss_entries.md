She had written several books, including novels, essays and children’s books before she published <em>El infinito en un </em><em>junco</em><em> (</em><em>Infinity in a Reed</em><em>)</em>, which won a number of prizes in Spain including the National Essay prize and spent 18 months in the bestsellers’ list there.

The English translation by Charlotte Whittle is titled <em>Papyrus</em>: <em>The Invention of Books in the Ancient World</em>.</p><p><strong>How did you become interested in ancient books and the beginning of the printed word?<br /></strong>It goes back to my childhood. My parents were great readers and our home was bristling with books. I was fascinated by these rows of tiny black insects running across [the page] that only adults could interpret. And later, my studies of classical philology brought me into contact with the period when books emerged for the first time.

It was a brilliantly entertaining game but, for all the excitement, one which ended up going the same way as the previous 32 these two sides have played over the past seven decades. Wales had good reason to hope it would be different given that New Zealand have lost four Tests this year, but in the end the All Blacks were much too sharp for a team who were playing their first Test in three months.</p><p>New Zealand were 20-0 up after 20 minutes through two short range tries by Codie Taylor, a penalty and a pair of conversions by Richie Mo’unga. The tries sprang out of small Wales mistakes: one was started by the superb Ardie Savea after he ripped the ball off Ken Owens deep in New Zealand’s own half, the other by Aaron Smith after he scragged Tomos Williams off the back of a Welsh scrum in midfield.

<p>Canadian artist <a href="https://www.labeg.art/">Gabriel Lau</a> fell in love with luxury watches while studying product design at university. Like most of us, he can’t afford them, so he drew his dream Rolex – purposefully skew-whiff, but completely accurate in dimension and design – and photographed it stuck on his wrist for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/labeg/?hl=en">Instagram</a>. That was the start of his paper watch collection. He has now made Patek Phillipes, Cartier timepieces and Omega Seamasters out of cardboard. “I’m still most passionate about vintage Rolexes; there’s so much character in vintage watches,” he says. His main message is a simple one: “If you’ve got nothing to do, make stuff.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2022/nov/05/luxury-watches-crafted-from-paper-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pretending that opaque, error-prone ML is part of the grand, romantic quest to find artificial intelligence is an attempt to distract us from the truth</p><p>One of the most useful texts for anyone covering the tech industry is George Orwell’s celebrated essay, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_and_the_English_Language">Politics and the English Language</a>. Orwell’s focus in the essay was on political use of the language to, as he put it, “make lies sound truthful and murder respectable and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind”. But the analysis can also be applied to the ways in which contemporary corporations bend the language to distract attention from the sordid realities of what they are up to.</p><p>The tech industry has been particularly adept at this kind of linguistic engineering. “Sharing”, for example, is clicking on a link to leave a data trail that can be used to refine the profile the company maintains about you. You give your “consent” to a one-sided proposition: agree to these terms or get lost. Content is “moderated”, not censored. Advertisers “reach out” to you with unsolicited messages. Employees who are fired are “let go”. Defective products are “recalled”.

<p>Jennifer Lawrence gives a phenomenal performance as a US soldier who heals in more ways than one while recovering from a brain injury</p><p>“Bathrooms can be dangerous,” says the kindly physiotherapist who is charged with patching up the shattered motor skills of former US soldier Lynsey (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/oct/27/jennifer-lawrences-best-performances-ranked">Jennifer Lawrence</a>). Lynsey was, until recently, serving in Afghanistan, so she knows a thing or two about danger. But following a brain injury, her immediate challenges are no longer IEDs but the threat of slipping in the shower. It’s a lot to take on board for a fiercely independent woman who had chosen her army career partly for the distance it afforded her from her home, from her unreliable mother (Linda Emond) and the buried traumas of her upbringing. Initially just marking time until she is well enough to redeploy, Lynsey takes a job cleaning pools and strikes up a friendship with James (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/nov/03/widows-atlanta-brian-tyree-henry-im-black-i-cant-do-method-acting">Brian Tyree Henry</a>), an amputee mechanic who is attempting to fix her borrowed truck. And it’s this – the unexpected bond between strangers who didn’t know they needed each other – that is the picture’s heart.</p><p>This subdued, sensitive drama explores wounds that run deeper than Lynsey’s head injury or James’s missing leg. Director Lila Neugebauer, making her feature debut following work in series such as the Netflix production <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/oct/01/maid-review-netflix-homelessness-drama">Maid</a></em>, opts for an unshowy realism that emphasises the chewiness of the actors’ work. Lawrence is phenomenal, giving the kind of wary, reined-in performance that made such a compelling impression in her breakthrough film, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/19/winters-bone-film-review">Winter’s Bone</a></em>. And the always excellent Henry gradually strips back a character who at first seems wholly at ease with life to reveal layers of suppressed guilt and pain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/05/causeway-review-jennifer-lawrence-brian-tyree-henry">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Prasanna Puwanarajah, who is playing the disgraced BBC broadcaster, on how the Netflix drama approached the infamous Panorama programme</p><p>It was the TV interview that confirmed it all. When Diana, Princess of Wales, agreed to join Martin Bashir on Guy Fawkes night in front of BBC cameras to talk about her feelings of marital betrayal and loneliness, the foundations of the British establishment shook. The broadcast of that fateful interview was, of course, also a moment of personal pain and sorrow for Prince Charles, now King Charles, and their two sons, William and Harry.</p><p>The BBC have since agreed never to show the <em>Panorama</em> programme of 1995 because of the duplicitous way Bashir <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/apr/25/diana-bashir-and-that-tv-interview-now-panorama-investigates-itself" title="">secured the late princess’s involvement,</a> misleading her into suspecting widespread treachery against her. But now, contrary to the wishes of the royal family, the makers of<em> The Crown</em>, the award-winning Netflix drama, have faithfully recreated the infamous encounter and are to show its key moments, as well as the background to the broadcast, over two episodes of the upcoming fifth season, which starts on Wednesday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/05/were-right-to-recreate-that-interview-with-diana-crown-actor-defends-controversial-storyline">Continue reading...</a>

Instead of fire, air, water and earth, hip-hop has rapping, DJing, breakdancing and graffiti.

<p>The theoretical physicist and martial arts expert has written a new book that uses magic and wizardry as a portal to engage people with the important but overlooked field of condensed matter</p><p>Felix Flicker is a theoretical physicist working on the quantum underpinnings of matter. Born in Devon, he studied at Oxford, the Perimeter Institute in Ontario, Canada, and Bristol University, where he completed his PhD. Now a physics lecturer at Cardiff University, he is also a kung fu teacher and former British champion of shuai jiao (Chinese wrestling). Flicker, 35, has just published his first book, <em>The Magick of Matter: Crystals, Chaos and the Wizardry of Physics</em>, exploring the often overlooked field of condensed matter physics, which underlies our modern world.</p><p><strong>What prompted you to write this book? <br /></strong>Condensed matter physics is the biggest area in physics – about a third of all physicists work on it – but nobody’s ever heard of it. One reason is because it’s the study of familiar stuff – states of matter and their transformations. It’s also practical: it leads to most of the technology around us these days. Being practical and familiar seems to be at odds with being magical. I wrote the book to address that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/nov/05/scientist-felix-flicker-compared-with-a-kung-fu-fight-in-public-giving-a-talk-on-physics-isnt-a-problem">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Anfield mainstay is in clear need of a rest, with Jürgen Klopp’s leggy squad urgently crying out for some fresh faces</p><p>It was around halfway through the first half of Liverpool’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/oct/29/liverpool-leeds-premier-league-match-report">defeat to Leeds United</a> at Anfield last Saturday that Fabinho made his feelings known to the crowd. The hosts had once again failed to string some passes together and as the ball drifted out of play there came groans from the Kop. Hearing this, Fabinho turned to the stand and began waving his arms in a call for support, doing so aggressively and with a snarl on his face. He clearly was not happy and neither were those watching on, with a fair few making that clear to him.</p><p>It was an ugly moment during another ugly occasion for Liverpool this season and in its own way a snapshot of Fabinho’s campaign in particular. To put it bluntly, he has been really poor, consistently failing to provide the deep-lying midfield security that has been a hallmark of the now 29-year-old’s displays for Jürgen Klopp’s side since his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/28/liverpool-fabinho-monaco-close-signing">arrival from Monaco four years ago</a>.

<p>The Parisian pop maestros discuss getting their groove back, recording in the Louvre and the debate raging over their homeland’s cultural identity</p><p>Deck D’Arcy has a theory. The Phoenix bassist thinks that, on the band’s fifth album, 2013’s Bankrupt!, they “lost the groove”. The French four-piece were at the height of their fame: 2009’s Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix had bridged the gap between skinny-jeaned indie pop and festival tent EDM, vaulting d’Arcy and his bandmates – lead singer Thomas Mars and guitarist brothers Christian Mazzalai and Laurent Brancowitz, or Branco – to festival headliner status; their single 1901 was ubiquitous for what felt like years.</p><p>And yet, something had faltered; the groove, that alchemy, had dissipated. With a few years of touring and hard work, d’Arcy slowly started to feel it return. “We had it back on [2017’s] Ti Amo,” he says. “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/22/nile-rodgers-my-family-were-high-functioning-addicts-i-inherited-that-gene" title="">Nile Rodgers</a> says you have to optimise the groove, and I think on this album” – Alpha Zulu, released yesterday – “we’re getting close.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/05/phoenix-interview-alpha-zulu">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Get hands on with this north Italian buckwheat ribbon pasta and serve it with sage, lemon, parmesan and butter, or with lemony miso cabbage and spiced breadcrumbs</p><p>I could eat pasta every day of the year, and there are so many varieties out there that I could probably eat a different type every day as well. All too often, though, I default to the big-hitters – linguine, penne, spaghetti – and all too often I buy it in rather than make it from scratch. If you’re in the same pasta boat (or bowl), I hope today’s recipes inspire you to make your own, not least because there’s no pasta machine required. Pasta that’s made mainly with buckwheat flour will be a revelation to those who are new to it: it is nutty, toothsome and hearty.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/nov/05/pizzoccheri-pasta-recipes-buckwheat-cabbage-spring-onions-cheese-butter-lemon-sage-yotam-ottolenghi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The UK-based photographer had to act quickly to capture his mini-moggy’s perfect pose – but is it enough to make Pearly Whiskers famous?</p><p>John Angerson was working late one night when the family kitten hopped on to his desk. “She was only about three or four months old; I think we got her a little bit early,” he says. “This was the first time she’d made her way into my office. As she sat in my in-tray, I reached for my phone to take a quick photo – the yawn was just good luck.”</p><p>Angerson’s daughter Daisy, who was four at the time, named the tabby Pearly Whiskers. Angerson admits that she hasn’t grown into the most affectionate of cats. “She usually only appears at breakfast and tea – she’s very independent. She still wanders into the office sometimes, but usually just to nibble on my wires until I give her food,” he says. “She does like to hang out in Daisy’s bedroom, though. When I told her about this, she asked: ‘Is Pearly Whiskers going to be famous?’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/05/yawning-kitten-john-angerson-best-phone-picture">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The author narrates her powerful debut novel about a British-Indian girl who suddenly loses the ability to speak</p><p>In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/01/somebody-loves-you-by-mona-arshi-review-talk-is-cheap">Mona Arshi’s debut novel</a>, which has been shortlisted for the Goldsmiths prize (the winner is announced next week), a British-Indian girl named Ruby suddenly stops speaking. She recalls how, after a teacher asked her a question at school, “I opened my mouth as a sort of formality but closed it softly, knowing with perfect certainty that nothing would ever come out again.” Ruby is tested for aural dysfunction, assorted viruses and “general stupidity”, and shrugs off the efforts of peers, teachers and her therapist to make her talk. As she moves up to secondary school, her father anxiously suggests she take the opportunity to reinvent herself by finally engaging in conversation. But still, she remains silent.</p><p>Arshi, a poet and former human rights lawyer, is the silky-voiced narrator of this vivid coming-of-age tale; her reading is tender, thoughtful and full of heart. Through Ruby’s child’s-eye view, we learn her mother has had a mental breakdown which occurred the same day that her sister, Rania, found a fox cub and tried to bring it into the house. Ruby also mourns the loss of her pen-pal, Clare, after Clare’s father found out his daughter’s correspondent had brown skin.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/05/somebody-loves-you-by-mona-arshi-audiobook-review-a-vivid-coming-of-age-tale">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The master storyteller on finding a voice, creative originality and why he has never suffered from writer’s block</p><p>My first novel, Hear the Wind Sing, published in 1979, is fewer than 200 pages long. Yet it took many months and much effort to complete. Part of the reason, of course, was the limited time I had to work on it. I ran a jazz cafe, and I spent my 20s labouring from morning to night to pay off debts. But the real problem was that I hadn’t a clue how to write a novel. To tell the truth, although I had been absorbed in reading all kinds of stuff – my favourites being translations of Russian novels and English-language paperbacks – I had never read modern Japanese novels (of the “serious” variety) in any concerted way. Thus I had no idea what kind of Japanese literature was being read at the time or how I should write fiction in Japanese.</p><p>For several months, I operated on pure guesswork, adopting what seemed to be a likely style and running with it, but when I read through the result I was far from impressed. “Good grief,” I moaned, “this is hopeless.” What I had written seemed to fulfil the formal requirements of a novel, yet it was rather boring and, as a whole, left me cold.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/05/i-want-to-open-a-window-in-their-souls-haruki-murakami-on-the-power-of-writing-simply">Continue reading...</a>

In non-medical applications (remember that Botox is now used widely to treat migraines, teeth grinding, incontinence, excessive sweating and more), it is injected around “dynamic wrinkles” – that is, deeper lines that are moving constantly throughout everyday life. This prevents those habitual movements that both deepen the wrinkles and exaggerate their appearance. A serum or cream can never truthfully claim to do the same or have anything like the effect, regardless of your commitment to the cause (you can spend your life savings on skin serum and never see off those frown lines between your eyes).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/nov/05/botox-is-no-substitute-for-robust-skincare-regime">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Baby back ribs braised till they fall off the bone, then topped with herby crumbs, and a comforting stew of lentils and black pudding cooked in chorizo oil  </p><p>Food, for me, is about memories and family, and today’s two pork-and-potato recipes are cases in point. The rib dish was one of my dad’s all-time favourites, and the way my mum still makes it is very simple indeed: she slow-cooks the meat until it’s really tender, then adds the potatoes and cooks them until they’re just starting to break down. The lentil dish is likewise steeped in our home life in Spain. When I was a kid, I couldn’t stand lentils, and remember a big drama one day when I turned my nose up at a bowl of them one lunchtime. Mum made me have them for dinner, too, and again for breakfast the next morning! Anyway, fast-forward to today and I love lentils so much, this is now my death row dish.</p><p>Recipes extracted from The Spanish Home Kitchen: Simple, Seasonal Recipes and Memories from My Home, by José Pizarro, published by Hardie Grant at £27.

## Hollywood: The Oral History by Jeanine Basinger and Sam Wasson review – dinner with the stars

<p>From pancakes with Jack Nicholson to drinks with Billy Wilder – stories from the great and good of Tinseltown</p><p>The American Film Institute (AFI) is where Hollywood’s collective memory lives. Anyone who was (or still is) anyone, from Harold Lloyd to Barbra Streisand, has had their brain hoovered and the results transcribed and deposited in the AFI’s vaults for safekeeping. Distinguished film historian Jeanine Basinger and journalist Sam Wasson have been granted access to these treasures, from which they have stitched together what they call “an oral history of Hollywood”. In other words, here are 400 cinema insiders, including directors, makeup people and actors, recounting what it has been like to make-believe for a living.</p><p>The result is fascinating in all the ways you might expect and some you wouldn’t. The fact, for instance, that many of the early Hollywood men were first world war veterans (from both sides) who had been trained in aerial photography and wanted to carry on doing something similar on civvy street. They had, of course, also been through hell and yearned to build an alternative moral universe where good trounced evil and there was always a loyal, pretty girl waiting patiently at the end. As for why the West Coast was picked for this new enterprise, Henry Blanke, producer of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, explains: “There was eternal sun here. The lenses were slow. The film was slow. Everything was slow, and you needed sun. Sun. Plenty of it.” Later, when sound came in, the fact that Hollywood was a “wilderness” helped enormously. “Sunset Boulevard wasn’t even paved”, which cut down on the rumble of the traffic, remembers one old-time agent.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/05/hollywood-the-oral-history-by-jeanine-basinger-and-sam-wasson-review-dinner-with-the-stars">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Its cast is cartoonish, the plot is packed with dull speeches and multiple episodes could have been binned entirely. The royal drama has never been less relevant</p><p>Six years ago, when Netflix debuted a plush, true-ish drama about the British royal family, it was a period saga set in the half-forgotten past, and a production with a direct link to modern times: incredibly, the woman we saw becoming Queen in 1952 was still on the throne. Season five of The Crown now arrives as the first to be shown since its protagonist’s death – and the show itself feels as if its time has come and gone.</p><p>The continuing documentation of the late Elizabeth II’s reign – we have reached the years 1992 to 1997 – is not the issue, since the end of her era in real life ought to increase the need for a complete dramatisation. Nor should the show’s increasing proximity to the present day present a problem for its writer, Peter Morgan, whose reputation pre-Crown was for finding new angles on statespeople’s recent exploits, the royals included. Yet these new episodes are bitty and often just boring, with Morgan casting around for side plots to hide the fact that everything he has to say about the Windsors has already been said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/05/the-crown-season-five-review-its-time-for-this-bitty-boring-show-to-end-forever">Continue reading...</a>

It was just constant wooden-toothed men drinking liquor and dying over a card game, or families who travelled across the world for the promise of fortune and succumbed to wagon accidents along the way. Or it’s thousands of animals slain in a concerted effort to starve out the indigenous Americans, or it’s viciousness and inexplicable wasting illnesses and everyone is always spitting. The only people who seemed to have any sort of good time in the Old West were the guys selling bullets and shovels, and it’s never really made sense that we so romanticise an era of backstabbing and hucksterism and people with bad breath wearing the same pair of long johns for six months straight.

When she first auditioned for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-crown" title="">The Crown</a>, the soapy royal family saga that doubles up as a tabloid flashpoint, it wasn’t to play Diana at all. She read for a part way back in season two, though she won’t say which, because someone else played it “beautifully”. “Also, if I told people, they’d be like, <em>what</em>?” she adds, as if the idea is absurd, which means we can only speculate that she was up for the part of Prince Philip.</p><p>She thought she had blown it. “Well, I <em>did</em>, in the fact that I did not get the part,” she deadpans. The Crown’s creator, Peter Morgan, spotted something else, however. “They obviously saw something Diana-ish in my audition, which is really not what I was going for at that time.” Her agent called her and asked if she’d be interested in playing Diana at some point in the future. She filed it away in the back of her mind, where it lurked until a couple of years ago. Then she got the call. “It was a much more formal, will you do this role?” She’d had plenty of time to think about it.

<p>In a new docuseries, the life of the abusive music mogul is contrasted with that of Lana Clarkson, the woman he was convicted of murdering</p><p>As the Boomers aged into parenthood, one musical standby of their own youth became permanently enshrined in the Christmas canon. Every December, the generations young enough to have been reared on pop will put on A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector, a compilation album featuring 60s girl groups like the Ronettes and the Crystals singing the Yuletide standards. On the final track, however, mega-producer and impresario Spector delivers a direct address to the listener over the gentle strains of Silent Night, explicating his vision for the project and thanking the public for allowing him into their homes. There’s a creepy intimacy to the spoken-word song, Spector’s reedy voice gentle yet insincere, his speech sentimental yet egotistical. Even without knowledge of his turbulent backstory, a child trimming the tree can pick up on something unsettling.</p><p>Spector, a four-part documentary airing this week on Showtime, catalogues the contradictions making up an essential, contemptible figure without attempting to untangle them. “Like a lot of people my age who grew up listening to music from the 60s with their parents, I knew the work of Phil Spector before I knew who he was,” says Don Argott, co-director of the upcoming miniseries with Sheena M Joyce. “I knew the eccentric stories, him pulling guns, the trial, his Afro hair, but this knowledge wasn’t really fully formed.” This is the man in broad strokes, a living dissonance between the creative output that gave exquisite voice to teenybopper innocence and the violent, erratic behavior behind the scenes. But if his story is a tragedy of hubris ending in homicide, that means he’s only one of two main characters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/05/phil-spector-docuseries-showtime-lana-clarkson">Continue reading...</a>

Former primetime host Megyn Kelly subverted the narrative, asserting that Brown’s reported last words, “Hands up, don’t shoot,” were a lie, and that Brown was the aggressor. Twenty-six-year-old Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren described Black Lives Matter as “the new KKK”. Fox commentators had also defended police and rejected claims of systemic racial injustice in America. Nevertheless, the public reaction to Floyd’s murder was on a completely different scale to earlier protests, and it took place amid swirling speculation that Donald Trump would declare martial law.</p><p>It is essential that we grieve with the Floyd family, closely listen to the voices of peaceful protest and fundamentally understand that Black Lives matter.

<p>Kash Patel questioned about claims documents found by FBI had been declassified while Trump was still president, says source</p><p>Kash Patel, a top adviser to Donald Trump, testified before a federal grand jury in Washington on Friday about the former president’s unauthorized retention of government documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort, according to a source familiar with the matter.<br /><br />The questioning from federal prosecutors centered on Patel’s claims the documents that the FBI found at the property had been declassified while Trump was still president, as well as why the documents had been removed from the White House, the source said.<br /><br />Patel testified before the grand jury after the justice department this week granted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/02/trump-advisor-kash-patel-immunity-mar-a-lago-documents">him limited immunity</a>, which guaranteed he would not be prosecuted in the criminal investigation over his statements or information derived from them.<br /><br />The move to immunize Patel reflects the importance of his testimony about the purported declassification, and appears to reflect a decision to forgo a potential case against him in order to secure evidence against a bigger target such as Trump.<br /><br />The status of the documents is important because if prosecutors can prove that those seized by the FBI during its search of Mar-a-Lago this summer were not declassified, it could strengthen a potential obstruction case contending that Trump used the claims as an excuse for why he did not return records that had been subpoenaed.<br /><br />Trump and advisers like Patel have claimed repeatedly since the Mar-a-Lago search that the seized documents were declassified, though no such evidence has emerged and Trump’s lawyers have not repeated the assertions in court filings, where they could face penalties for lying.<br /><br />The justice department did not believe that Patel would offer incriminating evidence against Trump. Still, federal prosecutors considered Patel – who Trump appointed as a representative to the National Archives – a witness with insight into the former president’s actions.<br /><br />The Guardian first reported that the justice department was considering granting Patel use immunity on Wednesday morning, before it was issued later that day. The Washington Post earlier reported his appearance.<br /><br />The justice department is typically loath to grant immunity, especially in high-profile investigations that can set legal precedents, since it can make bringing charges against the person in the future more difficult.<br /><br />The approval must also come from the top echelons of the justice department, according to guidelines, and the preference for prosecutors to obtain testimony is to have defendants plead guilty and then have them offer cooperation for a reduced sentence.<br /><br />The justice department approved federal prosecutors to seek an immunity order after Patel earlier this month appeared before a federal grand jury hearing evidence in the Mar-a-Lago documents case, one source said. <br /><br />But Patel asserted his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination to an array of questions at the 13 October appearance, the source said, though the basis for some was not clear; even if the documents were not declassified, making false public statements would probably not be a crime. <br /><br />In the obstruction investigation surrounding Trump by the former special counsel Robert Mueller, for instance, prosecutors concluded that the former president’s false statements about his campaign’s ties to Russia would only have been criminal if he made them to Congress or the FBI. <br /><br />In a statement, a spokesperson emphasized how Patel had no choice in testifying to the grand jury despite his reservations: “His testimony was compelled over his objection through the only legal means available to the government – a grant of limited immunity.”<br /><br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/04/trump-adviser-immunity-mar-a-lago-papers-kash-patel">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There should be no mistake about what this fight is for. It is a fight against a theocratic regime which denies the most basic human rights</p><p>I am a free woman. It’s a luxury not afforded to the women of my motherland, Iran. As an Australian with Kurdish Iranian heritage, the past six weeks have been a whirlwind of emotion. A cocktail of fear, grief, guilt, pride and hope. Fear for the safety of millions of Iranians living under an oppressive rule. Grief for the hundreds of innocent lives lost, the thousands imprisoned and being brutally tortured. Guilt for not having been a stronger voice for a pain I know only too well. Death is the ultimate price for freedom in Iran. This disparity should not be lost on anyone living with basic human rights.</p><p>Iran is a country of contradictions. It possesses intense natural beauty, deep cultural and historical roots, and a formidable people from a kaleidoscope of ethnic origins. For 43 years Iran has been under theocratic rule, led by a supreme leader and a power structure that has instilled fear in the very people it governs, and that has ostracised the country from the global community.
