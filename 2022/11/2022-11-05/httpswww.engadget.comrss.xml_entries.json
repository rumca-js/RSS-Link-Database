In a statement, HBO said:</p><p>\"Over the past four seasons, Lisa and [Jonathan] have taken viewers on a mind-bending odyssey, raising the bar at every step.

They also falsely claimed that the business model was tested to be sustainable and that it was possible to become profitable on subscription fees alone, the feds said.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In addition, the executives allegedly claimed that HMNY had \"big data\" and AI technologies that could be used to generate revenue for the company by analyzing data collected from MoviePass subscribers.

The business did not have a non-subscription revenue stream that would make it self-sufficient or offset its losses, according to authorities. Farnsworth and Lowe were also accused of implementing various tactics to prevent certain subscribers from being able to use their \"unlimited\" service. If you'll recall, MoviePass had to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/moviepass-settles-with-ftc-122507602.html\">settle with the FTC in 2021</a> over allegations that it invalidated subscriber passwords on purpose to give it sufficient reason to freeze accounts of frequent users.&nbsp;</p><p>In a statement made to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/4/23441119/moviepass-fraud-criminal-charges-mitch-lowe-hmny\"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the spokesperson for Farnsworth said: \"The indictment repeats the same allegations made by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Commission's recent complaint filed on September 27th against Mr. Farnsworth, concerning matters that were publicly disclosed nearly three years ago and widely reported by the news media. As with the SEC filing, Mr. Farnsworth is confident that the facts will demonstrate that he has acted in good faith, and his legal team intends to contest the allegations in the indictment until his vindication is achieved.\"</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sec-sues-moviepass-executives-220027888.html\">SEC sued MoviePass</a> for fraud back in September and also accused the executives of misleading investors about the viability of the company's $9.95-per-month business model.

Stacy Spikes, its original co-founder, purchased it back after HMNY filed for bankruptcy. The service relaunched in September 5th and now charges subscribers $10 a month for up to three movies, $20 a month for up to four and $30 for a maximum of five movies a month.&nbsp;</p><p>As for Farnsworth and Lowe, they're now facing a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each count of securities and wire fraud.</p>", "favourite": false}]
