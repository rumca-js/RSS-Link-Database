One is any progressive-run city in America. The other is Montana, where the governor's race won't be decided until November 13th. This's when John Dutton is projected to be elected governor. That shouldn't be a spoiler. It's on all of the<em> Yellowstone</em> commercials for season five.</p><p>The question is... what about a season six? <em>People Magazine</em> (<a href="https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2022/11/04/cole-hauser-confirms-that-season-5-is-not-the-end-of-yellowstone-its-not-the-last-season/" target="_blank">by way of Whiskey Riff</a>, who provides me with great country music) caught up with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/yellowstone-cole-hauser-bar-fights" target="_blank">star Cole Hauser</a> on the red carpet and here is what he had to say.</p><blockquote>It’s not the last season.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>In fact, the reason co-creator Taylor Sheridan skipped the red carpet was that he was busy writing season six. The Dutton story will continue. Good, because there was some concern <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kevin-costner-yellowstone-quits" target="_blank">Kevin Costner's wife was going to nag him into leaving the show early</a>. </p><p>There has to be at least one more season. The Dutton's have done a LOT to save their ranch, including running for statewide office and killing a bunch of f*cking people. At some point, they need to lose the ranch to move the story forward. It's basic Syd Field stuff. It's what Joseph Campbell and his thousand-faced hero would do.</p><p>They need to lose the ranch so they can spend at least one season fighting to get the ranch back. Then and only then can the show end. John Dutton can be buried on his property. And in twenty years, they can reboot <em>Yellowstone</em> with his grandchildren fighting over who gets to keep the land.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Bobby Flay shocks CNN on just how bad the economy is by listening to his customers

I'm unclear on why or what he was promoting. What's clear is someone at CNN is getting fired for allowing Flay to talk about what a trainwreck the economy is so close to Election Day. They should have asked him about abortion or January 6th. </p><p>Instead, they asked for his insight on how he thought the economy was going. You know, what with Bobby Flay being an entrepreneur running an empire. Two words: it stinks.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Chef and restaurateur Bobby Flay: "The thing about restaurants is it's an every-night focus group of how people are feeling about the economy."<br /><br />"Getting squeezed from every sort of corner and edge...We're on the brink of some really bad economy here...seen this happen before." <a href="https://t.co/lAn5kullkd">pic.twitter.com/lAn5kullkd</a><br />— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) <a href="https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1588520046699188225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>The thing about restaurants is it's an every-night focus group of how people are feeling about the economy. And what's happening is it's getting queezed from every sort of corner and edge.</blockquote><p>Right, but Biden Democrats and his allies in the media say the economy is stronger than it's ever been, and have carefully curated statistics that say so. Inflation is only a problem because <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joy-reid-inflation" target="_blank">Republicans have misinformationed people about a word they have never heard before</a>.</p><p>The obvious problem is Rock Shrimp Productions (Flay's company) doesn't have a Legal, Trust and Safety department. Flay's servers need to be trained to fact-check customers when they hear such misinformation from being spread. The problem is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nova-scotia-public-gathering" target="_blank">too many unauthorized conversations</a> are allowed in Bobby Flay establishments.</p><blockquote>Unfortunately I've been around long enough to see this happen before. And ultimately we were able to come out of it, but you do have to hold on tight. I feel like something not good is happening... and I watch the way people are acting in the restaurants.</blockquote><p>This is the part the left doesn't seem to get. They can share as many pie charts as they want. <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/10/31/social-media-disinformation-dhs/" target="_blank">They can work with all the non-profits and "independent" "fact" checkers so that it doesn't look like government propaganda</a>. None of that matters. What matters is when voters look at their bank balances. Or their 401ks. Or that when the server at a Bobby Flay restaurant is overhearing customers talk about how they're struggling, that server is working the second job they were forced to take.</p><p>Everything sucks for people. Our "leaders" in charge claim our struggles are misinformation. Next Tuesday is... next Tuesday.</p><p><p>

Because Maher went off on a typical leftist rant Friday night that <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/tv/democracy-is-on-the-ballot-and-unfortunately-its-going-to-lose-bill-maher-makes-dire-election-prediction/" target="_blank">democracy will be destroyed if Republicans win next Tuesday</a>. The one difference between Maher and other leftists is that he blames his side for allowing it to happen.</p><p>Maher joined Burr's <em>All Things Comedy</em> podcast and summarized why Democrats suck so hard in two words: woke culture.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Bill Maher: “Woke culture... It's one reason why the Republicans are going to do so well in this election.” <a href="https://t.co/hdNKkHj9jR">pic.twitter.com/hdNKkHj9jR</a><br />— Citizen Free Press (@CitizenFreePres) <a href="https://twitter.com/CitizenFreePres/status/1588642229396025344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>I am very much a critic of what goes on on the fringe of the left.

<p>The dumbest thing about the left is that it's not just their wokeness that is going to get them jollystomped on Tuesday. It's not their obsession with woke culture at the expense of every other issue. It's their obsession with woke culture WHILE IGNORING every other issue as voters try saying "no, this is what we care about."</p><p>Democrats aren't upset that you can't afford to fill up your car or need a second job to afford groceries on the table. They don't care if you are afraid to leave your apartment without getting assaulted. But if you say "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-maher-kid-rock" target="_blank">ya know, I think five-year-olds might be too young for drag queens</a>," the left gets emotional and makes an issue out of it. They'll insist <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/back-to-school-jenna-tailia" target="_blank">Jenna Talia</a> teach your kids' kindergarten class.</p><p>Inflation and crime? <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joy-reid-inflation" target="_blank">Those are just conspiracies</a> created <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kathy-hochul-hillary-clinton" target="_blank">by the Republican party</a>. The Republican Party who -- not to tempt the wrath of the whatever from high atop the thing -- is looking to have a decent day on Tuesday.</p><p><p>
