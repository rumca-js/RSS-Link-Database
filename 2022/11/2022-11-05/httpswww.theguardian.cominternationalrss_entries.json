Distinguished film historian Jeanine Basinger and journalist Sam Wasson have been granted access to these treasures, from which they have stitched together what they call \u201can oral history of Hollywood\u201d.

The film was slow. Everything was slow, and you needed sun. Sun.

Still, federal prosecutors considered Patel \u2013 who Trump appointed as a representative to the National Archives \u2013 a witness with insight into the former president\u2019s actions.<br /><br />The Guardian first reported that the justice department was considering granting Patel use immunity on Wednesday morning, before it was issued later that day. The Washington Post earlier reported his appearance.<br /><br />The justice department is typically loath to grant immunity, especially in high-profile investigations that can set legal precedents, since it can make bringing charges against the person in the future more difficult.<br /><br />The approval must also come from the top echelons of the justice department, according to guidelines, and the preference for prosecutors to obtain testimony is to have defendants plead guilty and then have them offer cooperation for a reduced sentence.<br /><br />The justice department approved federal prosecutors to seek an immunity order after Patel earlier this month appeared before a federal grand jury hearing evidence in the Mar-a-Lago documents case, one source said. <br /><br />But Patel asserted his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination to an array of questions at the 13 October appearance, the source said, though the basis for some was not clear; even if the documents were not declassified, making false public statements would probably not be a crime. <br /><br />In the obstruction investigation surrounding Trump by the former special counsel Robert Mueller, for instance, prosecutors concluded that the former president\u2019s false statements about his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia would only have been criminal if he made them to Congress or the FBI. <br /><br />In a statement, a spokesperson emphasized how Patel had no choice in testifying to the grand jury despite his reservations: \u201cHis testimony was compelled over his objection through the only legal means available to the government \u2013 a grant of limited immunity.\u201d<br /><br /></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/04/trump-adviser-immunity-mar-a-lago-papers-kash-patel\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/05/world-cup-2022-team-guide-england", "title": "World Cup 2022 team guides part 5: England", "date_published": "2022-11-05 00:01:35+00:00", "description": "<p>Gareth Southgate has a talented squad but is under pressure to attack with the defining moment of his tenure approaching</p><p><em>This article is part of the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/world-cup-2022--guardian-experts--network\">World Cup 2022 Experts\u2019 Network</a>, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 20 November.</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/05/world-cup-2022-team-guide-england\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/05/i-am-free-while-the-women-of-iran-are-not-afforded-the-same-luxury-but-now-they-are-spearheading-a-revolution", "title": "I am free while the women of Iran are not afforded the same luxury \u2013 but now they are spearheading a revolution | Setareh Vaziri", "date_published": "2022-11-05 00:00:35+00:00", "description": "<p>There should be no mistake about what this fight is for.
