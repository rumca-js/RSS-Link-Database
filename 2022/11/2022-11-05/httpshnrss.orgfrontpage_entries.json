In his personal blog[0], he has been writing about technology and society for years. He has also a YouTube channel[1][2] to teach and encourage Iranians to programming and Linux, and a podcast[3] that has been explaining technology and science news along with his comments for several years. All this in a country with a dictatorial government where standing in the right place has a heavy price.<p>His arrest occurred on October 5, a few days after the recent nationwide protests[4] began in Iran. Arrest at home with beating. The reason for this is not yet clear, but it is probably due to his efforts to increase awareness of the society about Iran's internet censorship system, and his positions against a company called ArvanCloud. Many claim this company help the government of Iran in implementing the internet censorship's system (something like Great Firewall of China). In Jadi's own words, this company has made it possible for the government to turn the Internet into an intranet at any moment and block people's access to international services. Something that happens in every demonstration in Iran including right now.<p>The reason I am writing here is to raise awareness about him, which may lead to his release. All this may be nothing more than a false hope, but it is what I can do. From the news he covered in his podcast, it could be guessed that he is one of the regular readers of Hacker News. Perhaps hearing your support here will boost his morale behind bars in Evin. The prison which is also known as Evin University due to the number of educated political prisoners [5].<p>[0](Persian) https://jadi.net/<p>[1](Persian) https://www.youtube.com/jadimirmirani<p>[2](English) https://www.youtube.com/geekingjadi<p>[3](Persian) https://castbox.fm/channel/%D9%BE%D8%A7%D8%AF%DA%A9%D8%B3%D8%AA-%E2%80%93-%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%AF%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%86%D8%AA-%7C-%DA%A9%DB%8C%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%A2%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%AF-id22150?country=us<p>[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahsa_Amini_protests<p>[5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evin_Prison</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33484185\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33484185</a></p>\n<p>Points: 371</p>\n<p># Comments: 30</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://twitter.com/goangelo/status/1588696157794242560", "title": "Context to Twitter's 2023 advertisers issues", "date_published": "2022-11-05 17:46:51+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/goangelo/status/1588696157794242560\">https://twitter.com/goangelo/status/1588696157794242560</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33483751\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33483751</a></p>\n<p>Points: 47</p>\n<p># Comments: 29</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33483661", "title": "Tell HN: Linode's Abuse form is absolute garbage", "date_published": "2022-11-05 17:38:45+00:00", "description": "<p>We are getting a lot of abuse traffic from Linode lately and it is absolutely frustrating filling out their abuse form: https://www.linode.com/legal-abuse/<p><pre><code>  - There is no option for DDOS.\n  - If you make a mistake and need to click back all the filled out data is gone\n  - You can only report 1 IP at a time\n  - The confirmation mail is full of errors such as listing Name as \"First Name\" as in the field description and not what I entered.\n  - The confirmation mail comes from \"wordpress@linode.com\"\n  - No ability to attach for example a pcap file\n</code></pre>\nSince I am also a Linode customer I have sent such abuses via ticket system as well but it takes over 24 hours for anyone to respond just to tell you to use the abuse form.

Because of specifics of my job I need to have a powerful workstation(I mostly need a powerful CPU) and I am comfortable with at least two 27\" monitors. Traveling with that much stuff is only possible with a car, and even then the whole setup takes too much space.<p>Laptops are getting there with the compute power, but the 27\" monitors aren't getting any smaller. Meta Quest Pro(which seems to be the top of the line now) has been just released and even tho it is somewhat pricey($1500), it still costs as much as three good 27\" monitors.<p>Does anyone have any useful experience to share on working in a VR headset?

HN,<p>Obviously we are experiencing a surge of stable-diffusion based apps at the moment, but I have yet to see anyone try and map the outputs onto actual physical products that can be delivered to your door.<p>I wanted to make it easy to:<p>- pick an artistic style<p>- hit 'record' and speak into your phone / tablet / desktop or whatever, and describe the kind of design you want your clothing to have (since speaking is more spontaneous that typing)<p>- swipe among a variety of mockups (t-shirts, hoodies etc.) featuring your design, and order it to your door with the click of a button<p>The product is called 1SEWN. Fulfilment is currently achieved using a print-on-demand service called Printful (<a href=\"https://www.printful.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.printful.com</a>) that I have integrated with.<p>If you guys would like to try it, I would love some feedback. Shipping is currently limited to outside Europe, but even if you are in Europe, your feedback about the whole UX would be much appreciated!<p>Much love,<p>Matt</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33480679\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33480679</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://drinksdigest.com/2021/10/11/there-are-cool-bars-in-antarctica/", "title": "Did you know there are cool bars in Antarctica?", "date_published": "2022-11-05 12:04:46+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://drinksdigest.com/2021/10/11/there-are-cool-bars-in-antarctica/\">https://drinksdigest.com/2021/10/11/there-are-cool-bars-in-antarctica/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33480663\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33480663</a></p>\n<p>Points: 27</p>\n<p># Comments: 13</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://wiki.c2.com/?TelescopeRule", "title": "Telescope Rule (2008)", "date_published": "2022-11-05 11:54:59+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://wiki.c2.com/?TelescopeRule\">https://wiki.c2.com/?TelescopeRule</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33480605\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33480605</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://dusted.codes/the-type-system-is-a-programmers-best-friend", "title": "The type system is a programmer's best friend", "date_published": "2022-11-05 11:49:03+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://dusted.codes/the-type-system-is-a-programmers-best-friend\">https://dusted.codes/the-type-system-is-a-programmers-best-friend</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33480571\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33480571</a></p>\n<p>Points: 22</p>\n<p># Comments: 18</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://nautil.us/why-your-brain-isnt-into-the-future-245128/", "title": "Why Your Brain Isn\u2019t into the Future", "date_published": "2022-11-05 11:32:37+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://nautil.us/why-your-brain-isnt-into-the-future-245128/\">https://nautil.us/why-your-brain-isnt-into-the-future-245128/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33480457\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33480457</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mastodon-simplified-federation/", "title": "Mastodon \u2013 Simplified Federation", "date_published": "2022-11-05 11:10:40+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mastodon-simplified-federation/\">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mastodon-simplified-federation/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33480315\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33480315</a></p>\n<p>Points: 22</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33479609", "title": "Ask HN: Is everyone on Hacker News super charismatic?", "date_published": "2022-11-05 09:30:49+00:00", "description": "<p>I see the ideas on here, and the complexity of the arguments present, and I think \"Holy shit\" everyone on here is probably a great conversationalist and insanely emotionally smart.

And recently, my other team members started using Mandarin between themselves even when the one who struggles with English isn't around.<p>Sometimes, certain words clue me in that they're talking about our project, and it makes me feel excluded. Isn't one of the benefits of coming into the office is being able to overhear project conversations and be able to join in?<p>My manager is remote and has no idea any of this is happening.

However, you can still build complex structured data.<p>Something about why I'm building Structpad:\nI love taking notes and I think it's necessary for deep thinking because our brain is very powerful, but it has one weakness - memory.\nI noticed that not only the text itself matters, but also some invisible structure in our minds. There are various tools that try to reveal this structure, such as filenames, folders, tags, links, tables of contents, but they are often complex and unreusable.\nSo I wanted more structure, less clutter, and no extra clicks.<p>Programming languages   use OOP for a higher level of abstraction, to create more complex programs, so why not use something similar for our thoughts instead of plain text? In this way, Structpad reduces the load on memory for the sake of the quality of using the mind.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33477431\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33477431</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-orders-twitter-cut-infrastructure-costs-by-1-bln-sources-2022-11-03/", "title": "Musk orders Twitter to cut infrastructure costs by $1B \u2013 sources", "date_published": "2022-11-05 02:32:06+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-orders-twitter-cut-infrastructure-costs-by-1-bln-sources-2022-11-03/\">https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-orders-twitter-cut-infrastructure-costs-by-1-bln-sources-2022-11-03/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33477204\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33477204</a></p>\n<p>Points: 22</p>\n<p># Comments: 12</p>", "favourite": true}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.jetbrains.com/aqua/", "title": "Jetbrains Aqua", "date_published": "2022-11-05 02:12:14+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/aqua/\">https://www.jetbrains.com/aqua/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33477056\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33477056</a></p>\n<p>Points: 36</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://blog.frontiersin.org/2022/11/03/60-of-home-compostable-plastic-doesnt-fully-break-down-ending-up-in-our-soil/", "title": "60% of home compostable plastic doesn\u2019t fully break down, ending up in our soil", "date_published": "2022-11-05 02:00:53+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://blog.frontiersin.org/2022/11/03/60-of-home-compostable-plastic-doesnt-fully-break-down-ending-up-in-our-soil/\">https://blog.frontiersin.org/2022/11/03/60-of-home-compostable-plastic-doesnt-fully-break-down-ending-up-in-our-soil/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33476960\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33476960</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 11</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1588676939463946241", "title": "Elon Musk: \u201cthermonuclear name & shame\u201d against advertisers pulling out", "date_published": "2022-11-05 01:39:39+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1588676939463946241\">https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1588676939463946241</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33476801\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33476801</a></p>\n<p>Points: 42</p>\n<p># Comments: 32</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://blog.acolyer.org/2020/01/08/ironies-of-automation/", "title": "Ironies of Automation", "date_published": "2022-11-05 00:24:52+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://blog.acolyer.org/2020/01/08/ironies-of-automation/\">https://blog.acolyer.org/2020/01/08/ironies-of-automation/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33476157\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33476157</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}]
