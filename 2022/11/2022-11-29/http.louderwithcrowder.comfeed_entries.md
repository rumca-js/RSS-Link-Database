I think a lot of you maybe have this problem but we haven't been able to put a finer point on it.</p><p>We can argue all we want about how many genders there are and the sort of the Culture War, but it's a symptom of something pretty pervasive that the left today is quite literally — I’m using the term literally, not figuratively — trying to reverse reality itself…</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

## 'F*** every other comedian': Adam Sandler had his daughters write his Gotham Awards speech and it absolutely killed

Hey, it's good to laugh! And this was hilarious.</p><p>There is something called the Gotham Awards, and Sandler was an honoree of some sort. Sandler may not have even known what for or why he was there because he had his two daughters -- ages 16 and 14 -- write his speech for him. The only condition was he had to do the entire speech in one of his funny voices. What follows is a hilarious six minutes you should take the time to enjoy.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Adam Sandler adapts a Southern accent for his <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GothamAwards?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GothamAwards</a> acceptance speech, addressing "well-dressed dignitaries, highly educated hipsters and various other plus-ones." <a href="https://t.co/Zr7PrBepzi">https://t.co/Zr7PrBepzi</a> <a href="https://t.co/Bxi1nX6600">pic.twitter.com/Bxi1nX6600</a><br />— Variety (@Variety) <a href="https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1597422780479410179?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>These bars are my favorite:</p><blockquote>While daddy is with you tonight, we’re doing everything we’re not allowed to do when daddy is home, like eat his Yodels or try on his Spanx or, dare we say, laugh out loud at Ben Stiller movies. The last time daddy caught us chuckling away at the ‘Meet the Parents’ trilogy, he immediately stormed into the room he calls ‘The Screaming Room,’ which we just call ‘the shower,’ and bellowed out the phrase, ‘Only the Sandman makes people laugh. Fuck every other comedian.'</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Not sure what the beef is with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ben-stiller-zoolander" target="_blank">Ben Stiller</a>, but the Sandman can rest assured. Happy Gilmore can whoop Zoolander's ass any day of the week. </p><p>Love of Sandler might be a generational thing. But for me, I've always appreciated that he is who he is and his movies are what they are. Nothing but dumb laughs. He's spent his career picking an exotic place to vacation and writing a movie around it as an excuse to bring his friends and family. And when all else fails, he does a <em>Grown Ups</em> movie just so he can hang out with Rock, Schneider, and Spade.</p><p>Though ironically enough, my favorite film of his is <em>Funny People</em> where he plays an "Adam Sandler-like" comedian and they make fun of "Adam Sandler-like" movies.</p><p>God bless the Sandman! And f*ck every other comedian!</p><p>(Except for Crowder and Landau, obvi)</p><p><p><em><strong>Need a quick laugh?</strong> Check out and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMAtX9eFBpwc4LtgvbqsOpQ?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">subscribe to our CrowderBits YouTube channel</a> for Louder with Crowder skits, opens, and parody videos!</em></p></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

## Alyssa Milano sacrifices what little dignity she has left to Elon Musk in the most epic self-own I've seen

There is no coming back from this. Or, there wouldn't be if Milano had any self-awareness. Which, as any long-time follower of Milano on Twitter knows, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/alyssa-milano-black-man-podcast" target="_blank">she does not</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/alyssa-milano-tesla" target="_blank">It begins with the Volkswagon tweet</a>. Alyssa Milano claimed Elon Musk supports hatred and white supremacy in buying Twitter. So she sold her Tesla, the other company Musk owns. Milano then used the money to buy a Volkswagon, a company that ACKSHUALLY WAS founded on hatred and white supremacy.</p><p>Isn't it ironic? Elon thinks...</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">🤣💯<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1596597968634642433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The former actress floundered on the bird app. "I'm not owned! I'm not owned!," she no doubt cried as she banged away on her iPhone. Attempting to find the perfect combination of 280 words that would hit Elon right in his free speech fetish. She would win the argument and be celebrated by her peers. Instead, she retweeted what some are calling a meme. This meme.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Is this the freedom of speech you want, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@elonmusk</a>? How about copywrite infringement is that fine by you too? <a href="https://t.co/BQK2ENga4w">https://t.co/BQK2ENga4w</a><br />— Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) <a href="https://twitter.com/Alyssa_Milano/status/1597574599482671104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>She amplified a photo of herself proclaiming to the world that her vagina smells like cat piss. As you see, it's a photo of Milano. She is holding a sign. And those six words are on the sign, written in perfect comic sans. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cnn-elon-musk" target="_blank">CNN has yet to fact-check this tweet</a>, so I have no reason NOT to assume this is a legit photo. And that the actress got a little too personal during an audition for <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>.</p><p>We're not even at the self-own part. Though, it's worth pointing this is how many Twitter users Milano has:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="b67e5" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32223980&amp;width=980" />

<p>And this is how many Rick S. has.</p>

</p>
<p>Had the former actress not amplified CodeBlue6's tweet to her 3,500,000 million followers, the only way you know her vagina (allegedly) smells like cat piss is if you were one of the 413 people following Rick.</p><p>Milano's epic self-own -- the one she will never recover from -- is this. In accusing someone of copyright infringement, she spelled "copyright" wrong.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Copyright<br />— Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) <a href="https://twitter.com/Alyssa_Milano/status/1597640298863415296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>How embarrassing.</p><p><p>

## 'Don't be a vessel of the CCP': Ron DeSantis fires proverbial bazooka at Apple for threatening Elon Musk, Twitter

The media's new line of attack is to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-smartphone" target="_blank">have Twitter removed from the Apple and Google Play store</a> unless Musk bends the knee and "content moderates" users on Twitter the way the left wants them content moderated. Apple is threatening to do so, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-tim-cook" target="_blank">leading to Elon going public about it</a>. The Chief Twit now has backup in the form of America's Governor Ron DeSantis.</p><p>DeSantis made it clear. Apple issuing such a raw exercise of monopolistic power would require Congress to get involved.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">WATCH: Ron DeSantis says Apple removing <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@elonmusk</a>'s Twitter from app store warrants Congressional response<br /><br />"That would be a huge, huge mistake, and it would be a really raw exercise of monopolistic power that I think would merit a response from the United States Congress." <a href="https://t.co/VNjG6GuBcd">pic.twitter.com/VNjG6GuBcd</a><br />— Florida’s Voice (@FLVoiceNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/FLVoiceNews/status/1597619967062863874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>Don't be a vessel of the CCP on the one hand, and then use your corporate power in America on the other to suffocate Americans and try to suppress their right to express themselves.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>The bars about being a vessel for the CCP can't be stressed and repeated enough. The same day they issued threats to Musk, Apple updated their AirDrop software IN ONLY CHINA to make it more difficult for <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/china-protests-foreign-forces" target="_blank">protesters to communicate with each other</a> as they had been.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Apple has released a software update limiting the use of AirDrop in China in light of recent protests. <br /><br />AirDrop was being used by protesters to transmit info directly phone to phone, bypassing the Great Firewall of China. <a href="https://t.co/2UNtOeuTBZ">pic.twitter.com/2UNtOeuTBZ</a><br />— Whole Mars Catalog (@WholeMarsBlog) <a href="https://twitter.com/WholeMarsBlog/status/1597054942069460992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>DeSantis touches on another important point. Critics claim allowing such unabashed free speech to thrive on Twitter would open the gates of hell for "hate speech" and "threats." The truth is a lot of the recent deplatforming that happened to users was based on them being accused of "misinformation" <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/10/31/social-media-disinformation-dhs/" target="_blank">as defined by the Biden Administration</a>. </p><blockquote>These "experts" were wrong and you had people on Twitter that were calling that out and Twitter, the old regime and Twitter, their response was to try to just suffocate the dissent and Elon Musk knows that’s not a winning formula</blockquote><p>The terror that the left and the media (but I repeat myself) are displaying is both refreshing and terrifying to see. Refreshing because everything we knew they <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-expose-twitter-tweets" target="_blank">were doing behind the scenes is out in the open now</a>. We're seeing with our own eyes how freaked out these people are toward any opposing views being expressed.</p><p>Terrifying because of the number of people in power who think it's their holy quest <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/student-loan-house-gop" target="_blank">to silence any viewpoint they disagree with</a>. I'm not sure if it's worse that they were hiding it, or that they no longer are.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Unhinged woman throws epic hissyfit over (checks notes) an expired coupon

Then on one day in 1995, retail shopping influencer Shannon Hamilton echoed the words "the customer is always an asshole." Our latest example of that philosophy AND why so many of us prefer internet shopping is this woman. She made two mistakes. The first was attempting to use an expired coupon. The other was not noticing the prankster stage right with the camera out.</p><p>Side note: Clown World is rapidly becoming one of my favorite Twitter accounts.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://t.co/gXYlaGnurA">pic.twitter.com/gXYlaGnurA</a><br />— Clown World ™ 🤡 (@ClownWorld_) <a href="https://twitter.com/ClownWorld_/status/1597382101757620224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Standard viral video disclaimers apply. Time and location are unknown and allow for missing context. Perhaps the customer was calm until the employee made fun of her mother. And that's when the person started their smartphone.</p><p>Now that I think about it, the lady made a third mistake and one that is common of customers who feel they are being wronged. She acts as if the retail clerk gives a rip. As someone who used to work in retail, I can assure you... we do not. Maybe they <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/best-buy-nfl-defense" target="_blank">care at Best Buy</a>, but there they <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/best-buy-female-employee-shoplifter" target="_blank">care a little bit too much</a>.</p><p>This goes double if you work in a clothing store. Working in a clothing store is a person's first glimpse at what inconsiderate slobs some human beings are. Like, using dressing rooms the way some people use the streets of San Francisco level slobs. If this clerk worked a four-hour shift, she has no doubt uncovered four skidmarks in returned undergarments, had to fix the same wrack of blouses ten times, and had the customer who throws everything she finds in her basket, only to decide what she's keeping WHEN SHE'S AT THE REGISTER.</p><p>Had the angry customer tried using an expired coupon when the employee had a single f*** left to give, the results may have been different. Instead we got this hilarious meltdown.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Anti-communist protester goes OFF after being told China protests are fueled by 'foreign forces'

In America, that means blaming Russian misinformation and Elon Musk. In China, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/china-protests" target="_blank">where citizens are revolting against the government lockdowns</a>, the 'foreign forces' are... pretty much everyone.</p><p>This Chinese Chad isn't having it. And I pray the government hasn't found him after this brave speech.</p><p><a class="embed-preview-controls__remove shortcode-media-controls__button material-icons">delete</a></p><blockquote>Was it the foreign forces who started the fire in Xinjiang? Was the Guizhou bus overturned by foreign forces? Was everyone told to come here by foreign forces? No! We can't even access foreign internet. How are foreign forces meant to communicate with us? We only have domestic forces not allowing us to govern ourselves.  Can we leave the country? Or can er go to foreign internet? Neither! How are they meant to communicate with us? They can't. We just want freedom.<br /></blockquote><p>If anything, foreign forces have sided with the CCP. Apple, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-tim-cook" target="_blank">who isn't fond of the concept of free speech</a>, updated their Airdrop so that protesters can't use it as effectively as they have been doing.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Apple has released a software update limiting the use of AirDrop in China in light of recent protests. <br /><br />AirDrop was being used by protesters to transmit info directly phone to phone, bypassing the Great Firewall of China. <a href="https://t.co/2UNtOeuTBZ">pic.twitter.com/2UNtOeuTBZ</a><br />— Whole Mars Catalog (@WholeMarsBlog) <a href="https://twitter.com/WholeMarsBlog/status/1597054942069460992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>And those are just the foreign forces who bother to have an opinion. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Reporter: "What is the president's reaction when he hears protesters in China chant 'freedom' or 'Xi Jinping step down'?"<br /><br />Kirby: "The president's not going to speak for protesters."<br /><br />Reporter: "So there's no reaction?"<br /><br />Kirby: "These protesters are speaking for themselves." <a href="https://t.co/Q8Rg0QOx9J">pic.twitter.com/Q8Rg0QOx9J</a><br />— Washington Free Beacon (@FreeBeacon) <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeBeacon/status/1597323402578386944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>No. The protests started because an authoritarian government had the control to live out Fauci's soggiest dreams and locked people into their homes to combat SCHMOVID. A fire broke out and people died because they weren't allowed to leave.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The fire in Urumqi, Xinjiang, the last screams of the residents who were burned to death, other residents could only stand by the window to watch, because everyone was locked at home.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheGreatTranslationMovement?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheGreatTranslationMovement</a> <a href="https://t.co/Fr1gyrpPsa">pic.twitter.com/Fr1gyrpPsa</a><br />— The Great Translation Movement 大翻译运动官方推号 (@TGTM_Official) <a href="https://twitter.com/TGTM_Official/status/1596170716835373057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The "foreign forces" are the ones who need to be paying attention. When governments are allowed to control how much "freedom" you are allowed to have, you get China. Or as we saw earlier this year, Canada.</p><p><p>

## WaPo finds a reason to write anti-Elon Mush hit piece over him drinking Diet Coke. No, really.

I'm all about any excuse for Elon Musk-ish content. These clicks don't bait themselves. But I'm a hack blogger and never claim to be otherwise. <em>Washington Post</em> is supposed to be journalism. Yet they found a reason to turn Musk's affection for Diet Coke into a reason to attack him. Proving once again that democracy derps in the darkness.</p><p>It all begins with the Chief Twit sharing a photo of his nightstand.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">My bedside table <a href="https://t.co/sIdRYJcLTK">pic.twitter.com/sIdRYJcLTK</a><br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1597165510595989504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Besides the weaponry, Elon drinks lots of Diet Coke. Not unlike, you know, everyone. If those were Diet Pepsi cans, there would be cause for alarm. I'd be inclined to think that maybe Musk buying Twitter WAS a Russian psyop. Only commies prefer Diet Pepsi. Musk throws back Diet Coke like a 'Merican.</p><p>But while a normie would see a funny photo, WaPo found something more problematic. And an excuse to tie him to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cnn-trump-diet-coke" target="_blank">America's other famous Diet Coke drinker</a>.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Twitter owner Elon Musk shared a photo of his bedside table littered with cans of Diet Coke, reminding us of the power the beverage has. <a href="https://t.co/p7zL5TLONT">https://t.co/p7zL5TLONT</a><br />— The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) <a href="https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1597386433270104065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>And I quote:</p><blockquote>In 2018, the New Yorker stuck a fork in the Diet Coke phenomenon, citing as evidence its unsavory acolytes, including former president Donald Trump and Harvey Weinstein. It is, the magazine declared, ‘the elixir of soft-bodied plutocrats desperate to shed their shady pasts and, possibly, a few pounds.’</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="90f57" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32222415&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>WaPo has <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-twitter-verification" target="_blank">had a vendetta</a> against <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-smartphone" target="_blank">Elon Musk ever since</a> the billionaire <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/wapo-saagar-enjeti" target="_blank">first announced he was buying Twitter</a>. More so than any of their peers in the journalisming content industry. Whether it has to do with leftist outrage over a single social media platform they don't control or Jeff Bezos being in his feels over only being the second richest man in America, who is to say? As I said, I'm not a journalismer.</p><p>But could the dinkuses at the paper not find ANY other reason to attack Musk? Other than using four cans of Diet Coke to tie him to Havey Weinstein? Did they run out of unnamed sources close to the matter who wish to remain anonymous and have thoughts on Musk firing people? </p><p>An article comparing Musk to modern history's greatest monsters due to their shared preference for carbonated beverages is lame. Please join me in being embarrassed for all involved since no one at WaPo has the self-respect to be embarrassed for thhemselves.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Ye storms off of Tim Pool podcast after receiving the tiniest bit of pushback on anti-semitic views

The interview didn't last long.  Twenty minutes in, there was disagreement over who, quote, "they" were. And when Pool pushed back ever so slightly, Ye walked out.</p><p>Ye, in discussing the fallout <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/show-notes-ye" target="_blank">over a rash of anti-semetic comments</a> and his meeting with former President Donald Trump -- the one where none of the best people Trump hired knew who was in Ye's entourage and also meeting with the former president -- was saying <em>"When I found out that they tried to put me in jail, it was like a dog was biting my arm. I almost shed a tear, almost. But I still walked in stride through it."</em></p><p>Pool followed up and said "they" had been unfair to Ye. And because Pool said "they" and not, presumably, "the Jews," Kanye walked off.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Kanye West just stormed out of a livestream on <a href="https://twitter.com/Timcast?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Timcast</a> because Pool refused to go along with West's antisemitic and conspiratorial assertion that Jews control the corporate press.<a href="https://t.co/TRD7snV3zk">https://t.co/TRD7snV3zk</a> <a href="https://t.co/OXHiTGVmaM">pic.twitter.com/OXHiTGVmaM</a><br />— Colin Wright (@SwipeWright) <a href="https://twitter.com/SwipeWright/status/1597404251700928512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>We later discover that Ye's reason for storming off is that Pool didn't believe in Ye's "truths." The phrase "my truth" is a liberal-progressive term that means "my opinion I can't defend."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Timcast co-host <a href="https://twitter.com/Lukewearechange?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Lukewearechange</a> said that Ye told him as he was leaving the studio "you don't believe in my truths." <a href="https://t.co/ZT1SCk77ZO">pic.twitter.com/ZT1SCk77ZO</a><br />— Greg Price (@greg_price11) <a href="https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1597406857185832961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The podcaster issued a statement after the incident.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">lol<br />— Tim Pool (@Timcast) <a href="https://twitter.com/Timcast/status/1597407629558820864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Do you know what we have here?</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>"Cancelling" people for words that come out of their mouths is ineffective and dumb. When it goes from "I said a wrong thing on Twitter" to "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ye-applepay-other-americans" target="_blank">I can't access my bank accounts</a>," leftists are always going to find a "wrong thing" you said. When you cancel someone who says "they" are out to get me, it makes others think "maybe this person has a point." And never in the history of the media playing the "you must denounce game" has it done anything other than give the person "you must denounce" the exact attention they're looking for,</p><p>The more effective thing to do is to let the person spout "their truths" and see how easily those truths crumble over any pushback. Now instead of "they're" out to get Ye, all the stories are that Ye looks like a Beta over the slightest criticism.</p><p><p>
