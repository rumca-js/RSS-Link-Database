If the west, and especially the US, is serious about helping to protect Ukraine, decisions on stepping up military assistance need to be made now. If Ukraine is to be able to secure its future after victory – assuming that is what the west truly wants – its forces need to begin to transition to Nato-standard equipment.</p><p>The US has not yet declared a <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/end-beginning-ukraine">political or military objective</a>. However, in April the US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/us-diplomats-to-return-to-ukraine-and-fresh-military-aid-unveiled-after-blinken-visit">said he wanted</a> “to see Russia weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine”. Is it the intention of the United States genuinely to support military efforts to return Ukraine’s internationally recognised borders? Or does it instead suit US and western decision-makers to support a long war with Ukrainian forces used as proxies to bleed out Russia’s armed forces? Obviously, these are not at all the same thing. Decisions need to be made very soon about increasing military support, and those decisions will tell us which objective is being pursued.</p><p>Frank Ledwidge is a barrister and former military officer who has served in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/29/ukraine-tanks-west-putin-russia-churchill">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Robert Downey Sr put his son in wild underground movies and gave him access to drugs. So what happened when Downey Jr finally turned the cameras on his dad? </p><p>In his father’s underground western Greaser’s Palace, a seven-year-old Robert Downey Jr plays, in his own words, “a boy who got his neck slit by God”. This, perhaps, explains a lot. Downey Jr grew up on Robert Downey Sr’s film sets in the 70s and 80s, amid what he calls “a cacophony of creativity”, at the heart of the counterculture cinema scene fuelled by “cigarettes and weed and booze”. He slept in a cot wedged against an editing desk, got taken to see X-rated films such as La Grande Bouffe at an absurdly young age, and went on a cross-country road trip as a kid where he “was in charge of the hash pipe”.</p><p>In the twilight of his father’s years, Downey Jr wanted some answers about why his father didn’t take better care of him. The resulting documentary – called Sr, with remorseless family logic – acts as part tribute, part therapy session and part last hurrah. “You,” Downey Jr, tells his father, “did not give a mad fuck, did you?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/29/fifteen-years-of-total-insanity-how-robert-downey-jr-made-peace-with-his-maverick-father">Continue reading...</a>

A global survey of more than 400 current players from 11 countries conducted by the Federation of International Cricketers’ Associations revealed that 14% felt they had been discriminated against based on their race. Almost two-thirds of the victims also said they felt they did not receive adequate support from their boards afterwards. In response to a separate query, 16% said they had felt “bullied, intimidated, or threatened” by their governing body, club or league.</p><p>“It’s clear that cricket has a long way to go to ensure that it is a safe and inclusive sport for all,” said Fica’s chief executive, Tom Moffat.

Fellow girl group RTMIS (pronounced Artemis) boasts similarly convincing stage confidence, while boy band F8 (pronounced Fate) approaches the delivery of English and Korean lyrics and kinetic choreography with enough militaristic precision to draw whoops from a crowd of about 600 at New York’s Circle in the Square theater on a recent Wednesday.</p><p>The trio are, on one level, the stable of acts meant to introduce a Korean pop label to American audiences in a one-night only concert debut.

The eardrum-shaking show, which opened last week after a long pandemic delay, straddles the line between Technicolor bilingual concert and musical theater, blurring Broadway conventions with arena pop adrenaline; four of the 18 cast members, including Luna as MwE, double as real-life K-pop idols.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/nov/29/kpop-musical-first-broadway-show-mwe-rtmis-f8">Continue reading...</a>

The official report blamed her death on heart failure, but eyewitnesses and her family insist that she was so severely beaten that she suffered a fatal brain injury. Since then, protests have raged across Iran despite the brutality of the government’s response. Over 400 people have been killed; an unknown number of journalists and demonstrators have been imprisoned or disappeared. Hundreds have been blinded by rubber bullets and metal pellets fired into crowds of protesters. Popular athletes – soccer star Voria Ghafouri and champion climber Elnaz Rekabi – have been detained for criticizing, or appearing to criticize, the government.</p><p>Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have begun targeting children.

Elsewhere in the lawsuit, Roeg says that Atlantic, a subsidiary of Warner Music Group, “utterly failed to engage in training or implementation of any policies or standards that would inform employees of the company’s disapproval of and how to report such conduct”.

<p>Australian champion Matt Formston says his vision impairment gives him an advantage as he continues to push boundaries in the water </p><p>This week, some of the world’s best big wave surfers are in Nazaré, Portugal, home to the biggest wave on the planet. An early season winter swell is pulsing into the underwater canyon off the Portuguese coast, with giant 8-9-metre (20-30ft) waves rising out of the ocean. They might not be the world-record breaking 26m (86ft) monster wave ridden there two years ago, but they’re not small either.</p><p>Among the surfers is 44-year-old Matt Formston. Like his counterparts, the Sydney-born surfer has been in the water for decades, winning national and international titles and riding some of the best waves in the world. But unlike his counterparts, Formston is blind; at Nazaré, he is becoming the first blind surfer to ride such big waves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/29/i-feel-like-im-ready-blind-surfer-chases-worlds-biggest-wave-at-nazare">Continue reading...</a>

It’s a clumsy thing to do: her dad is appalled (“who next, the gardener?”).

Despite her MBE, she never became part of the establishment</p><p>Mavis Best seems to have done so much in her life that nobody can quite keep track of it all. Talking to colleagues and relatives, her career was a never-ending whirlwind of campaigns, protests, community groups, grassroots organisations, official and unofficial roles – most of them centred on improving the lives and civil rights of Black people. Best, who died on 14 November aged 83, was awarded an MBE in 2002 for her “services to the community”, but the full extent of those services, from the late 1960s onwards, seems almost beyond measure.</p><p>“She used to do social work by day and support people by night,” says Best’s granddaughter, Isha Dibua. “Growing up, my grandmother’s house was always a place to come to if you needed help.

## If Labour’s leadership is hobbling internal candidates, is it fit to run a democracy? | Owen Jones

<p>Mounting evidence of dirty tricks against prospective MPs can’t be dismissed as leftwing sour grapes. We were promised a ‘broad church’</p><p>Britain will almost certainly have a Labour government in two years’ time: you have the Tories’ unprecedented self-immolation to thank for that. Debating, then, how Rishi Sunak’s successors will govern is a democratic imperative. To some of Keir Starmer’s more zealous supporters, scrutinising the opposition is an act of treachery that simply makes a Tory government more likely. Welcome to “Schrödinger’s left”: where the left of the party<strong> </strong>is simultaneously so irrelevant and toxic that it must be marginalised, but so powerful it can help determine the result of general elections.</p><p>In his pitch for the Labour leadership, Starmer promised that under his watch the party would be a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/17/keir-starmer-labour-leadership-pitch-radical-government">broad church</a>”, and that he would restore trust in Labour through “<a href="https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer/status/1228762701540864000">unity</a>”. To underline that this wasn’t just empty rhetoric, <a href="https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer/status/1224662165271056385">he said </a>that the selection of Labour candidates “needs to be more democratic and we should end NEC impositions of candidates. Local party members should select their candidates for every election.” To paraphrase Karl Marx, all that is a Starmer promise melts into air: but this particular issue has political consequences that go far beyond internal Labour politics.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/29/labour-leadership-internal-candidates-democracy-prospective-mps">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The psychotic male with a poetic side is an old saw, but director Marc Fouchard brings some original and freshly disturbing touches to it</p><p>This artfully made, borderline-despicable French drama revolves around Leo (Kévin Mischel), a brooding, lonely taxi driver with cheekbones sharp as dressmaker’s shears, a secret talent for musical composition, romantic longings for pretty dancer Amélie (Aurélia Poirier) and the uncontrollable urge to kill women. Whether he actually does that or not isn’t clear at first, since scenes where he murders one woman turn out to be fantasies … or are they?</p><p>In a way, this film seems to not care either way because it’s essentially much more interested in Leo and his mental anguish: anguish that is seeded by a former chanteuse mother (Dominique Frot) who beat him when he was little. The whole handsome-tragic-murderer shtick is one we’ve seen before in an assortment of films, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/13/peeping-tom-john-patterson">Peeping Tom</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/09/taxi-driver-review-scorseses-sleaze-is-still-the-bees-knees">Taxi Driver</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/11/kim-ki-duk-shock-violence-beauty-south-korea-director">Kim Ki-duk’s</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/jul/11/artsfeatures5">Bad Guy</a> – but at least writer-director Marc Fouchard brings a few offbeat touches that add some fresh texture. For a start, Amélie, Leo’s object of obsession, happens to be deaf which means she can’t hear the music Leo has written and plays in the car, which one customer complains about rudely. But deafness doesn’t stop Amélie from being an expressive, mesmeric dancer, and the bits where she performs are some of the best passages of the film.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/29/out-of-this-world-review-art-and-misogyny-collide-in-murderous-obsession">Continue reading...</a>

## Cult guitarist Roy Montgomery on Flying Nun, grief and embracing mistakes: ‘It’s an existential thing’

<p>Beloved by the likes of Dry Cleaning and Grouper, Montgomery’s life has been hit by more than one tragedy, stories he traces in meditative instrumentals</p><p>While travelling through the US in 1994-5, Roy Montgomery recorded two albums, Scenes from the South Island and Temple IV, which would set the tone for three decades of maverick work by the quietly avuncular New Zealand guitarist. “My partner Jo had died in 1992, and I felt I owed it to her to travel and deal with what had happened,” he says, via Zoom from his home in Christchurch. “I sub-let an apartment in New York from a friend with a four-track recorder and lots of effects. It was lonely, like solitary confinement, but it was good that I just sat there and processed what had happened, and turned it into something.”</p><p>The mesmeric guitar instrumentals he recorded in that apartment marked a turning point in Montgomery’s fitful musical career. Thirteen years earlier, his band Pin Group had released the first single on now-legendary independent label Flying Nun, later home to key Kiwi underground artists the Clean, the Chills and the Verlaines. Pin Group’s post-punk primitivism – which earned him the nickname “Roy Division” – was shaped by Montgomery’s realisation that he “wasn’t wired to be a virtuoso, so I should concentrate on ideas and experimentation”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/29/cult-guitarist-roy-montgomery-on-flying-nun-grief-and-embracing-mistakes-its-an-existential-thing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Luke McManus’s visually striking documentary explores a threatened working-class community and a strong music culture</p><p>Luke McManus’s resonant, vivid and beautifully shot film is a documentary essay on Dublin’s North Circular Road and its working-class communities and histories. The road runs from Phoenix Park in the west to Summerhill and the docklands in the east, with some neighbourhoods still deprived, others gentrified, and residents fighting back against being priced out. McManus interleaves plangent and melancholy folk music with individual interviews and reflections on the institutions and landmarks, including the brutal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountjoy_Prison">Mountjoy prison</a> and the building that once housed the grim St Brendan’s psychiatric hospital in Grangegorman.

What distinguishes North Circular is the overwhelming importance of music: there’s a musical tradition here that is not simply commemorative and static, but vital and evolving, and given a fresh burst of creativity by the emerging status of women in Ireland – the film features a potent contribution from north Dublin singer-songwriter Gemma Dunleavy.

<p>I’ve never had this problem before – but the moment we enter the bedroom, I lose my erection</p><p><strong>I am a 52-year-old man and my partner is 39. We have been dating for four months. </strong><strong>Our sex life is </strong><strong>miserable because I can’t satisfy her in bed</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>She has threatened to leave me because of this. </strong><strong>I</strong><strong> always enjoyed sex with my ex-partners and they were </strong><strong>happy with my sexual performance</strong><strong>, but this has got me </strong><strong>thinking something is wrong with me.</strong><strong> I love my present partner so much but the moment I enter the bedroom with her, anxiety and doubt set</strong><strong> in and I lose my erection</strong><strong>. As soon as she leaves, I feel relieved and my erection</strong><strong> returns. </strong></p><p>Anxiety and erectile difficulties go hand in hand. When a person fears he will not be able to have an erection, that can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. But I wonder why you are staying with someone who is unsupportive, even punitive. Don’t you deserve a partner who is patient and cherishes you? Instead of allowing her to make you feel inadequate, try asking for what you need. Let her know that you need kindness and appreciation … and that your penis would respond better too. Your penis is attached to your heart and sensibility, so her threats are far from useful. On the other hand, there are all kinds of reasons that someone who has had reliable erections no longer does – certain medical conditions, medication or stress, for example. Have a checkup, just in case.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

An emotional bond created during time spent at the club as assistant to Steven Gerrard meant he was destined to return. Blah blah. He could reasonably point towards a wider culture in football. Beale is not the first and will not be the last to have weighty sentiment almost immediately contradicted by actions. It is just that, in this case, it is bordering on the preposterous.</p><p>“It was a real privilege to be asked to go to speak to them but I didn’t think it was the right moment because I entered into an agreement here,” said Beale when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/oct/20/wolves-manager-qpr-michael-beale-turns-down-job">Wolves tried to coax him</a> from Queens Park Rangers. “Integrity is a real big thing for me, and loyalty. You don’t give it to receive it back but I think if they’re the values you live by then at times when you’re put in a position then you have to be strong by them. I’ve been all in here and I’ve asked others to be all in so I can’t be the first to run away from the ship.” This was in late October. Late October 2022. He will begin December as the new manager of Rangers. A switch from QPR to one of British football’s most esteemed clubs is hardly shocking but the self-aggrandising fuss Beale created when knocking back Wolves means onlookers are entitled to snort with laughter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/nov/29/mick-beale-is-a-cosy-appointment-when-rangers-need-a-ruthless-rebuild">Continue reading...</a>

Writer-director <a href="https://www.screendaily.com/features/jordanian-director-bassel-ghandour-on-his-forbidden-relationship-drama-the-alleys/5165861.article">Bassel Ghandour</a>’s feature debut represents the kind of criss-crossing ensemble piece that does well on the festival circuit (indeed, it recently played at the BFI London film festival), all the more so here as Jordanian cinema hasn’t yet established the same kind of exportable appeal as other Middle Eastern countries.</p><p>However, with a bit more scrutiny it doesn’t hold up quite so well, even if some of the performances, particularly from Maisa Abd Elhadi and Nadira Omran sinking their teeth into properly meaty characters, are terrific. At first, the story seems to revolve around small-time chancer Ali (Emad Azmi), who steers gullible tourists to nightclub fleshpots where they will spend big on drink and sex workers. The venue gives him a cut of their profits, but local kingpin Abaas (Monzer Reyahnah) takes against him and doesn’t want him darkening the door of the places he controls. Meanwhile, Ali is secretly seeing Lana (Baraka Rahmani), the naïve daughter of local hairdresser Aseel (Nadira Omran). However, someone is secretly filming Ali and Lana’s trysts from afar and using the video to blackmail Aseel, who turns to Abaas and his top henchwoman Hanadi (Abd Elhadi, coiled like a cobra throughout) for help.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/29/the-alleys-review-gritty-and-watchable-jordanian-drama-of-criss-crossing-lives">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The clarity of the novelist’s descriptive ability shines through essays on topics ranging from his treatment for cancer to the joys of an empty Venice</p><p>Publishers are very naughty. Even as many of them seem increasingly to disdain journalism, they’re often perfectly happy to repackage the stray bits and pieces of their luckiest writers as “essays” before sticking them opportunistically between hard covers. In the case of the Irish writer Colm Tóibín, I’ll give Viking a semi-pass for doing precisely this. He is a beloved and celebrated novelist. But I should also say that subscribers to the <em>London Review of Books</em> may feel a bit miffed should they cough up for <em>A Guest at the Feast, </em>for the simple reason that the majority of its contents appeared first there.</p><p>Luckily, I’m not a subscriber. This work was all new to me, with the exception of Cancer: My Part in its Downfall, the essay with which the book opens (I read it first online). An account of Tóibín’s treatment for testicular cancer, it doesn’t really set the tone for those that follow it; their focus is mostly on the old Ireland, its sins strung out here like beads on a rosary. But it does whet the appetite. Like many other writers on the same subject, Tóibín begins by being determinedly straightforward, even deadpan, about his illness. “It all started with my balls,” he writes, as blithe as if they were for ping-pong.</p><p><em>A Guest at the Feast</em> by Colm Tóibín is published by Viking (£16.99).

<p>The cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapsed earlier this month, leaving billions of dollars unaccounted for. Alex Hern explores what happened and where the money went</p><p>For a time, it seemed that everything Sam Bankman-Fried touched turned to gold. He’d been a maths whiz at university and made a fortune trading cryptocurrencies for a hedge fund before striking out on his own and founding a crypto exchange: FTX. The crypto boom made him a billionaire and he moved into a $40m apartment in the Bahamas with eight others in the group’s inner circle who were romantically linked. There were reports that stimulants were doled out to staff who worked intensely long days, often sleeping on beanbags at their desks.</p><p>Earlier this month, the music stopped. As investors in FTX began to take fright at rumours of a black hole in its balance sheet, the panic spread and Bankman-Fried failed to calm it. FTX collapsed, taking billions of dollars with it, and Bankman-Fried stood aside. Having become an ambassador for the crypto industry and one of its most trusted faces, he had become a pariah.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/nov/29/the-crypto-collapse-inside-the-crazy-world-of-ftx-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
