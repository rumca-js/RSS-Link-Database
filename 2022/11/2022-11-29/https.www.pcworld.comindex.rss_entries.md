<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>It&rsquo;s the bane of a techie&rsquo;s existence: providing tech support to family and friends, especially at the holidays. But the winners of Microsoft&rsquo;s Hackathon app think they have a new twist: a remote-access app for smartphones to help out family members.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbRyyq-gkgErhFiqCdtR-umwRUMU1GWENWT0RSQjEwNExERlFEMjBTN1kyRi4u&amp;xcust=2-1-1398491-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Family Tech Support</a> is a proposed app that will be submitted to broader review at Microsoft and eventually chief executive Satya Nadella for approval. (The link goes to the team&rsquo;s page, where you can sign up for further information.) Nicole Berdy and her team beat more than 10,000 other applications at Microsoft&rsquo;s recent Hackathon, which included more than 68,000 employees, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://news.microsoft.com/features/an-easier-way-to-help-people-give-tech-support-to-loved-ones-wins-microsoft-hackathon-top-prize/&amp;xcust=2-1-1398491-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Microsoft said</a>.</p>



<p>Microsoft already provides options for family members to support friends and family via solutions like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/625866/microsoft-remote-desktop-review.html">Remote Desktop, a fantastic PC-specific solution</a> that allows a trusted computer to remotely access a far-away PC, control it, and solve any problems. (Remote Desktop requires the affected PC to be running Windows 10/11 Pro, however, which is why there are sometimes <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394938/how-to-remote-access-a-windows-pc.html">better third-party solutions</a>.) But what Berdy and her team are proposing is a solution for a smartphone, which is a different track for Microsoft altogether. </p>



<p>Though <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398482/windows-10-mobile-is-finally-dead-how-to-take-your-data-and-move-on.html">Microsoft killed off its mobile phone platform</a>, Windows 10 Mobile, at the end of 2019, Microsoft has continued to maintain a strong presence in Android, with numerous versions of its Office apps, Outlook, Bing, and so on. The Windows &ldquo;Your Phone&rdquo; app essentially allows a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398215/how-to-use-windows-your-phone-app-to-connect-your-phone-to-your-pc.html">PC to remotely control an Android smartphone</a>, running remote apps and interacting with the screen, as well as placing phone calls and sending texts. It&rsquo;s likely that the same principles would underlie a Family Tech Support app, either via PC-to-mobile or a straight mobile-to-mobile experience.</p>



<p>The latter is certainly a direction Microsoft is talking about, based on a quote from Rajeshwari Godbole, a developer for Microsoft&rsquo;s Nuance Dragon Anywhere app. &ldquo;Whenever I would visit, I would set up the home screen for them with their favorite apps, but then they&rsquo;d accidentally delete the shortcut, and they&rsquo;d call me thinking the app was gone and they broke it, or they&rsquo;d hold the phone with a finger on the volume button and end up putting it on mute and couldn&rsquo;t hear it ringing anymore, and I just wished I could see the screen to know what was wrong,&rdquo; Godbole said, referring to interactions with parents and in-laws.</p>



<p>There are already numerous remote-access apps for Android, including TeamViewer and Android-VNC-Viewer. But Microsoft apparently thinks that there might be room to bring its brand and its ecosystem into the space, too &mdash; assuming Nadella signs off on it. </p>

## HP Spectre x360 14 review: OLED makes a great 2-in-1 even better

</div>


<p>With the latest iteration of its premium Spectre x360 14, HP adds two new premium features not found on last year&rsquo;s convertible alongside the requisite update to 12th-generation Intel silicon. The biggest addition is the high-resolution OLED panel that delivers exceptional image quality. The second addition is a high-resolution webcam, moving from an underwhelming 720p camera to a crisp and dynamic 1080p webcam.</p>



<p>The Spectre x360&rsquo;s overall design remains unchanged. The all-metal chassis with gold accents offers a solid feel and luxurious looks, while the display&rsquo;s 3:2 aspect ratio is geared toward business use rather than entertainment pursuits that would benefit from a wider screen. It&rsquo;s still a tad heavy for a 14-inch convertible, and the battery life is shorter than last year&rsquo;s model, but the Spectre remains a great pick for executive and other professionals looking for a portable and versatile two-in-one convertible.</p>



<h2 id="hp-spectre-x360-specs-and-features">HP Spectre x360 specs and features</h2>



<p>Our HP Spectre x360 14 test system features the following specs:</p>



<ul><li><strong>CPU:</strong> Quad-core Intel Core i7-1255U</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 16GB</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Intel Iris Xe</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 1TB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD</li><li><strong>Display:</strong> 13.5-inch 3000&times;2000, OLED touch panel</li><li><strong>Webcam:</strong> 1080p with physical camera shutter</li><li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> 2 x USB-C Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, combo audio jack, microSD card reader</li><li><strong>Networking:</strong> Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.0</li><li><strong>Biometrics:</strong> IR facial recognition, fingerprint reader</li><li><strong>Battery capacity:</strong> 66.5 Watt-hours</li><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 11.75 x 8.67 x 0.67 inches</li><li><strong>Measured weight:</strong> 3 pounds (laptop), 0.6 pounds (AC adapter)</li><li><strong>Price: </strong>$1,424.99</li></ul><p>The HP Spectre x360 series starts at $999.99. The baseline model features a 12th-gen Core i5 CPU, 8GB RAM, a 512GB SSD and a Full HD display. Our test system features CPU, memory, storage and display upgrades that raised the price. At HP.com, it&rsquo;s priced at $1,424.99, which reflects a $250 discount. Our test model is also available at Best Buy for $1,749.99, and it has occasionally been discounted to $1,399.99.</p>



<h2 id="oled-goodness">OLED goodness</h2>



<p>This year&rsquo;s Spectre x360 trots out the same looks as last year&rsquo;s model and remains a stunner. The all-metal chassis boasts a gorgeous, sophisticated design and rugged feel. There are three color options &mdash; silver, black, and a deep blue. (The latter two colors add $15 to the bill.) We received it in black. With the matte finish, it has subtle brown undertones that gives it a unique look among a sea of silver brushed aluminum laptops. The gem-cut edges and other gold accents create a pleasing contrast with the matte black surfaces.</p>



<p>The chassis remains the same as last year&rsquo;s model and therefore the weight stays the same at three pounds. That&rsquo;s a bit heavy for this class of 2-in-1, but most are close to three pounds. The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1, for example, with its 13.4-inch 16:10 display weighs 2.9 pounds. With the added heft, however, comes a solid feel. There is nothing flimsy about the Spectre x360.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we looked at the Spectre x360 last year, it featured an IPS panel with a 1920&times;1280-pixel resolution and a boxy 3:2 aspect ratio. An 3000&times;2000 OLED model was sold as a Best Buy exclusive, which you might have missed. Now the OLED display is available direct from HP. It adds a reasonable $110 to the price of the system. It&rsquo;s well worth the price. The OLED panel delivers incredible contrast with perfect blacks and bright whites. Colors are accurate and vivid. And the 3000&times;2000 resolution across the 13.5-inch panel creates a sharp image with crisp text.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Spectre x360 tablet mode" class="wp-image-1386123" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HP-Spectre-x360-14-tablet-mode.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>The display&rsquo;s 3:2 aspect ratio is taller than a 16:10 or 16:9 widescreen. Movies and shows don&rsquo;t fit as well as they do on a wider screen, but the boxier ratio is suited well for browsing the web and working on long documents. The 3:2 display is also a good fit in tablet mode. The squarer shape makes it feel more like an iPad than using a laptop spun around.</p>



<p>The touch display features pen support, and HP includes its Rechargeable MPP2.0 Tilt Pen. Tapping, swiping, and scribbling on the display felt natural with both a fingertip and the pen. There&rsquo;s no garage for the pen, but it connects magnetically to the side of the system.</p>



<p>Befitting of the premium Spectre x360 are its four speakers that produce premium sound. The speakers create dynamic audio with crisp highs and a bit of a bass response. The audio begins to lose some clarity when you push the volume past 80% but at that level there&rsquo;s still enough oomph to fill a small room.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="webcam-goes-to-1080p">Webcam goes to 1080p</h2>



<p>A 720p webcam has no place on a premium Spectre model, and HP made the move to a 1080p camera with this year&rsquo;s Spectre x360. It produces a clean, well-balanced image that has none of the grainy blotchiness of a 720p cam. If Zoom meetings and other video calls are a large part of your job, the 1080p will have you looking clearer to co-workers and clients. The camera has IR capabilities so you can log into the machine via facial recognition. And if you&rsquo;d rather use your finger instead of your face, there&rsquo;s a fingerprint reader tucked in between the spacebar and arrow keys at the bottom of the keyboard. Both biometric methods worked flawlessly.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Spectre x360 keyboard" class="wp-image-1386126" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HP-Spectre-x360-14-keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>The keyboard sacrifices the right Control key for the fingerprint reader, leaving only a Control key in the left corner. The keys offer a snappy response and quiet action for an overall pleasing and premium typing experience. One change from last year&rsquo;s model &mdash; HP got rid of the right-side column of Home, Page Up/Down, and End keys. Those keys are now doubled mapped to the four arrow keys, which may disappoint some typists. In the row of Function keys at the top, there&rsquo;s a key to cycle through the keyboard&rsquo;s two-level backlight and two others to mute the microphone and cover the camera. When the camera&rsquo;s physical cover is in place, you can see its white and black stripes to give you peace of mind that your privacy is protected. The mute and camera shutter keys themselves also have orange LEDs to give you visual proof that each device is deactivated.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Spectre x360 touchpad" class="wp-image-1386130" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HP-Spectre-x360-14-touchpad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>The gold-edged touchpad offers a quiet, firm click response and accurate recording of mousing gestures. It&rsquo;s near perfect. If I had a nit to pick, it would be the semi-glossy finish doesn&rsquo;t offer as smooth gliding as would a more matte finish.</p>



<p>The useful port selection remains the same as last year&rsquo;s model. There&rsquo;s a pair of USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports, a USB Type-A port, an audio jack, and a microSD card reader. One of the Thunderbolt 4 ports and the headphone jack are located on each of the back corners of the system. These corners are trimmed so each port sits on the diagonal. It&rsquo;s an unusual design point, and one I doubt will catch on because it makes it a bit harder to access these ports than if they were simply located on the side. And if I could, I would swap out the headphone jack and have a Thunderbolt 4 port in each corner. Not only would I be able to charge the Spectre x360 from either side, but the headphone jack would be closer to the front of the system and my ears.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Spectre x360 right ports" class="wp-image-1386137" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HP-Spectre-x360-14-right-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Spectre x360 left ports" class="wp-image-1386139" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HP-Spectre-x360-14-left-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>One last note on the power adapter. It also lives up to the premium Spectre name. The power brick is tiny and easily portable, and the cord is braided so it never tangles.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>



<p>Our HP Spectre x360 test system features the Core i7-1255U processor, 16GB of RAM, integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics, and a 1TB SSD. The Core i7-1255U is a member of Intel&rsquo;s 12th-gen Alder Lake U series of efficient, 15-watt mobile chips that feature Intel&rsquo;s new hybrid architecture. It has two performance cores, eight efficiency cores, and a total of 12 processing threads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We compared the Spectre x360&rsquo;s performance to a mix of similarly sized laptops with 12th-gen Intel Core processors from both the efficient 15-watt U series and more balanced 28-watt P series that sits between the U series and high-powered 45-watt P series. Rounding out the charts are a couple of laptops based on AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 7 5800U processor and a Dell XPS 13 based on an 11th-gen Core i7.</p>



<p>The system felt peppy during our time with it and operated in near silence. We did see the battery life decline from last year&rsquo;s model; the OLED panel is the likely cause for the shorter running time (more on that below).</p>



<p>Our first benchmark is PCMark 10, which measures performance on everyday computing work including office productivity tasks, web browsing, and video chats. All of the laptops here are overqualified for running general office apps. The Spectre x360 finished in the middle of the pack. With only two performance cores in the Core i7-1255U, the system couldn&rsquo;t keep pace with the two AMD-based laptops &mdash; the Ryzen 7 5800U has eight processing cores and 16 processing threads. And the next two finishers feature the Core i7-1260P, which has four performance cores along with eight efficiency cores and a total of 16 processing threads.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="HP Spectre x360 PCMark" class="wp-image-1386143" height="601" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HP-Spectre-x360-PCMark.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="904" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>Our HandBrake benchmark tests how a laptop is able to handle crushing CPU loads over a lengthy period&mdash;in this case, transcoding a 30GB MKV file to a format suitable for Android tablets using HandBrake, the free video encoding utility. The Spectre x360 again finished with a middling result and found itself well off the pace set by the systems with CPUs with more processing cores and threads.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="HP Spectre 360 Handbrake" class="wp-image-1386145" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HP-Spectre-x360-14-HandBrake.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="905" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>Next up is Cinebench, another CPU-intensive test but one that renders a complex 2D scene over a short period of time. The Spectre x360&rsquo;s Cinebench result is underwhelming. Its U series CPU is built for efficiency and not cranking through multithreaded multimedia applications. The Spectre x360 is a better fit for executives and other business users than creative professionals.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="HP Spectre x360 Cinebench" class="wp-image-1386148" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HP-Spectre-x360-14-Cinebench.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="904" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>On our 3DMark benchmark, none of the laptops here &mdash; the Spectre x360 included &mdash; distinguished themselves. But that&rsquo;s hardly a surprise given they all features integrated graphics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To test a laptop&rsquo;s battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 11&rsquo;s Movies &amp; TV app, with the laptop set to Airplane mode and earbuds plugged in. We set the screen brightness at a relatively bright 250 nits to 260 nits, which is a good brightness for watching a movie in an office with the lights on. The Spectre x360 lasted for more than 11 hours, which will get you through the longest workdays without needing to retreat to a wall outlet. That&rsquo;s an impressive figure, but other models offer runtimes that are hours longer. </p>



<p>Last year&rsquo;s Spectre x360 ran for more than three hours longer than this year&rsquo;s model. With both systems featuring the same 66.5Whr battery, I suspect the culprit of the shorter runtime is the high-resolution OLED display. Even though an OLED can turn off individual pixels, a greater number of pixels means a greater drain on the battery. And we&rsquo;ve yet to see any benefit in terms of battery life from an OLED laptop. In fact, we&rsquo;ve generally seen that an OLED panel has a slight adverse effect on a laptop&rsquo;s battery life.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="HP Spectre x360 battery" class="wp-image-1386149" height="601" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/HP-Spectre-x360-14-battery.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="905" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<h2 id="spectre-still-a-favorite">Spectre still a favorite</h2>



<p>Even with the decrease in battery life, we welcome the addition of the OLED display to the Spectre x360. It&rsquo;s one of those features that once you&rsquo;ve experienced it, you will never go back to the old way of a plain-Jane IPS LCD display. The gains in contrast and color dynamics are just too great. Plus, with OLED displays beginning to trickle down to midrange laptops, buyers should certainly expect an OLED on a high-end model like the Spectre x360.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OLED aside, it&rsquo;s one of the best looking 2-in-1 convertibles on the market. The brownish-black chassis is unique without being garish, and the all-metal chassis is rock-solid if a tad heavy. With its U series processor and integrated graphics, it&rsquo;s a better fit for general office tasks than creative work. Despite the drop in battery life, the Spectre x360 remains one of our favorite 2-in-1 business convertibles.</p>

<p>AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 7000 CPU lineup is here, and hot on its trail are the new X670E motherboards. What&rsquo;s a &ldquo;Hero&rdquo; without a great sidekick, after all!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much like a superhero, the Asus Crosshair X670E Hero is ready to deliver the goods. Its arsenal includes DDR5, PCIe Gen 5, and enough chops to power the fastest Ryzen CPUs. </p>



<p>Being an enthusiast favorite in previous generations, the Hero lineup aims to provide a similarly premium experience with this gen. In addition to its robust performance and ample features, it also offers an eye-catching gamer-approved design. It has enough features to entice content creators to its corner, too.&nbsp;(Fast USB4 being one mouthwatering addition.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The X670E Hero wants to be worthy of your superhero bucks. We&rsquo;ll discuss the specs, features, design, and performance. We&rsquo;ll see if this board alongside the Ryzen 7000 is the perfect duo to beat your supervillain foes.</p>



<h2 id="asus-rog-crosshair-x670e-hero-the-specs">Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Hero: The specs</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Hero" class="wp-image-1386171" height="560" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-10-27-at-3.28.19-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Hero has an MSRP of $699, placing it squarely in the realm of high-end enthusiast motherboards. It&rsquo;s targeted towards gamers, but has the goods to please workstation users, too. (Many people are using mainstream platforms since <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/707425/hedt-amd-threadripper-intel-mainstream-cpus.html">HEDT has priced out reasonable budgets</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ll look at the specs list, and more importantly,&nbsp; cover which features you should keep a keen eye on. Of course, you&rsquo;ll need a new Ryzen 7000 CPU&mdash;there&rsquo;s no backwards compatibility with Ryzen 5000 due to the new chipset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re considering X670E, you&rsquo;ll have some benefits over the cheaper mid-level B650 options. You&rsquo;ll get twice the theoretical USB and SATA ports with X670E. It will also give you more PCIe lanes, with PCIe Gen 5 for the GPU along with your NVMe drives. (B650 also has an &ldquo;B650 extreme&rdquo; variant, plus a standard B650&mdash;adding some complexity to the product stack. Here&rsquo;s our recent review of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1363181/gigabyte-b650e-aorus-master-motherboard-review.html">Gigabyte B650 Aorus Master</a>.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Hero" class="wp-image-1386175" height="1012" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_1662.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Some of the neat included extras with the Asus Crosshair X670E Hero.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>To further cement this board&rsquo;s premium position, the unboxing experience is amplified over mere mortal-level motherboards. You&rsquo;ll get some nice ROG goodies in the box such as a ROG M.2 PCIe card, a key chain, and even a graphics card holder! (You may need it for the new-generation goliath GPUs!)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus Crosshair X670E Hero" class="wp-image-1386189" height="948" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-10-27-at-3.26.37-PM-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Yes, this will look sweet in your tempered-glass gaming PC build. What&rsquo;s more, it will even perform beyond most expectations for workstation users. That&rsquo;s due to the caliber of included features offered here. Pair it with a Ryzen 9 7900X or 7950X, and you&rsquo;ll be putting past HEDT CPUs in the rear-view mirror. (Ahem, Intel 10980XE.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>With its premium price, the Hero differentiates itself from the lower-tier motherboards such as the Asus X670E Strix in a few ways that enhance the I/O experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>USB4? Yep, it&rsquo;s here and the fastest speeds we&rsquo;ve seen to date from USB&mdash;up to 40Gb/s. Six SATA ports, and a smattering of M.2 NVMe slots make this a content creators dream come true. (PCIe Gen 5 ensures you&rsquo;ll have plenty of future headroom for upgradability, too.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overclocking enthusiasts take note: You&rsquo;ll have the awesome start button (something that should be included in every motherboard!). Clear CMOS and BIOS Flashback are both available to ensure things can be reset if need be. A neat &ldquo;Q-Code&rdquo; display on the top right helps you diagnose issues rapidly. These features come in handy for everyday use as well as troubleshooting, even if you never plan to turn that overclocking dial.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus Crosshair X670E Hero" class="wp-image-1386191" height="916" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-10-27-at-3.27.37-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>DDR5 and PCIe Gen 5 are here to speed things up, in both gaming and everyday use. Want to pile on M.2 drives with hyper-fast speeds? This motherboard has the chops to handle that, as well as your PCIe Gen 4 GPU such as the Nvidia RTX 4090. With a healthy dose of PCIe lanes, you&rsquo;ll be far from saturating them in most use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>12 USB ports are nothing to scoff at, and very few motherboards include the super speedy USB 4. Like Thunderbolt, it has a wide-ranging potential for utility alongside its speed &ndash; such as displaying out to monitors.</p>



<p>With Ryzen 7000, you&rsquo;ll even be able to use the integrated iGPU if you need to troubleshoot your build without having to install a discreet GPU&mdash;a great quality-of-life feature that can &ldquo;save the day&rdquo; when you least expect it!&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want clear audio, the ROG SupremeFX ALC4082 Codec fits the bill and includes all the input and outputs you&rsquo;d want.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Networking is standard here, with Intel&rsquo;s 2.5GbE and 6E Wi-Fi. We&rsquo;d love to see a 10GbE port offered on this class of motherboard, as many enthusiast users would make use of it among the otherwise stellar I/O lineup.</p>



<p>We now expect these creature comforts everywhere: Q-Release to quickly free the GPU, and Q-Latch to easily install M.2 drives are now de rigueur creature comforts that turn burdensome build tasks into fun-to-use little mechanical innovations!</p>



<h2 id="asus-rog-crosshair-x670e-hero-design">Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Hero: Design</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus Crosshair X670E Hero" class="wp-image-1386200" height="722" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-10-27-at-3.29.52-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The $699 MSRP ROG Crosshair X670-E Hero wastes no time letting you know its worth. From the moment you lay eyes on its gorgeous design, you know you&rsquo;re in the presence of an enthusiast masterpiece!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting with the I/O shield area, you&rsquo;ll get a tasty treat with the &ldquo;Polymo&rdquo; customizable RGB effects and subtle Crosshair branding. Next, take in the chiseled VRM and M.2 heatsinks, as well as the beautifully done PCIe slot area in the middle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mirror-like surfaces surrounded by harder accented metal heatsink zones combine for a premium look. Sure, your GPU will likely obfuscate most of this area&mdash;but it&rsquo;s still glorious to look at, and inspires real pride of ownership!</p>



<p>The back is more ordinary, with a simple stamping of the motherboard name. We&rsquo;d love to see a backplate like what the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1376183/asus-rog-maximus-z790-hero-motherboard-review.html">Asus ROG Z790 Hero</a> offers, however.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus Crosshair X670E Hero" class="wp-image-1386207" height="898" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-10-27-at-3.28.05-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Asus Crosshair X670E Hero is built from high-quality materials, even the simplistic backside.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s a very attractive motherboard with a subtle, almost smoked-mirror look to it. Materials used are high quality and feel great.</p>



<h2 id="asus-rog-crosshair-x670e-hero-performance-software-and-bios">Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Hero: Performance, software, and BIOS</h2>



<p>Packing 18+2 power stages, with what Asus calls &ldquo;Teamed Power Stage Design,&rdquo; makes the board sound powerful, right? And it is&mdash;it can easily tame the hearty Ryzen 9 7950X without compromise.</p>



<p>Performance is robust, whether you&rsquo;re talking about gaming or workstation duties. Gamers will rejoice in the fast DDR5 speeds, and with RAM pricing coming down, it makes the prospect more appealing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You don&rsquo;t get the option of DDR4 on AM5 motherboards, as you do on Intel&rsquo;s Z790 lineup, but DDR 5 ensures you&rsquo;re future-proofed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Asus BIOS adds to the pleasure by being as good as ever for tinkerers. Overclocking RAM, undervolting CPUs, it&rsquo;s all here&mdash;and more. It&rsquo;s easy to use, intuitive, and full of options for the advanced user. If you&rsquo;d rather sit back and let the motherboard do all the work, it can handle that spectacularly, as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asus Ai overclocking and DDR5 preset RAM profiles keep your hardware working at peak capabilities with a click of a button.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asus&rsquo; Armoury Crate software has also been much improved this generation for those who prefer to stay out of the BIOS altogether. It can do fan profiles with Fan Xpert, Ai overclock your CPU, and even customize your RGB with Aura Sync. It can pull up driver updates for your motherboard, making it a one-stop shop for many users. The interface is attractive and easy to use, which is a plus&mdash;since motherboard software has historically been a bit bloated in the past.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-asus-rog-crosshair-x670-e-hero">Should you buy the Asus ROG Crosshair X670-E Hero?</h2>



<p>The Asus ROG Crosshair X670-E Hero brings enthusiast-grade features to satisfy both gamers and content creators. It does so with very few compromises, and while offering tremendous style.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a real class act.</p>



<p>Sure, it&rsquo;d be nice to see 10GbE rounding out the premium features, but it&rsquo;s still chock full of goodies. It packs all the new-generation buzzwords such as PCIe Gen 5 and DDR5 and offers a healthy dose of PCIE lanes. These all help to justify the $699 MSRP. The fact is, AM5 has higher overall platform costs when DDR5 and Ryzen 7000 CPUs are factored in. But you&rsquo;re also getting the most features and performance that we&rsquo;ve seen yet from an AMD mainstream motherboards. (You&rsquo;d have to step up to the $999 Asus ROG Extreme for features such as 10GbE networking).</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re a high-end enthusiast gamer or content creator who strives for one of the best motherboards on the market for AM5, this will be your Hero!</p>
