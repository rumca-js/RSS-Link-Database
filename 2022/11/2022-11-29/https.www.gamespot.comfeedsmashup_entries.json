For the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-super-mario-bros-trailer-is-a-full-on-mario-party/1100-6509555/\">upcoming Super Mario Bros.

We've also changed his design for the first time since he became a 3D model in the original Donkey Kong Country game,\" Miyamoto said in comments directly after the trailer. At a glance, Donkey Kong looks quite familiar. Just like the version seen in Donkey Kong Country, he's a big ape wearing a bright red tie with his initials in yellow letters--it's hardly a reimagining for the character. Even the font on the tie is the same.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-super-mario-movie-features-a-redesigned-donkey-kong-shigeru-miyamoto-says/1100-6509563/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-endgame-what-to-do-after-you-beat-the-story/1100-6509562/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Pokemon Scarlet And Violet Endgame - What To Do After You Beat The Story", "date_published": "2022-11-29 22:44:00+00:00", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-scarlet-pokemon-violet/\">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</a> changed the Pokemon formula, offering an open world that you were free to explore.

This consists of returning to each gym to face off against its leader again, except this time they are rocking high-level Pokemon. You will be facing off level 65+ Pokemon and each gym leader will have at least five Pokemon in their team.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Completing all eight gyms will unlock the Academy Ace tournament.

He also said that working on such a project would be \"really fun.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Though the studio first became famous for its Burnout series in the early 2000's, Criterion has now worked on the Need For Speed franchise for longer than it did on the racing series that made it famous. (Criterion's first Need For Speed, Hot Pursuit, came out in 2010; the initial run of Burnout games spanned from 2001 to 2011.) The last core entry in the series, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/burnout-paradise/\">Burnout Paradise</a>, came out in 2009 to wide acclaim.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-immediate-plans-for-a-new-burnout-despite-studio-hopes/1100-6509536/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-hours-of-the-callisto-protocol-leaks-online/1100-6509543/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Two Hours Of The Callisto Protocol Leaks Online", "date_published": "2022-11-29 15:35:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The Callisto Protocol comes out very soon, but that apparently didn't stop players who somehow got early copies of the game from leaking its first few hours online. As spotted by <a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/2-hours-of-callisto-protocol-gameplay-has-leaked-ahead-of-next-weeks-release/\">VGC</a>, one leaker uploaded the first two hours of the game online in a series of three videos.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This isn't the first time that significant footage of the upcoming horror game has leaked. Last week, a leaker posted the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-opening-minutes-have-leaked-online/1100-6509463/\">first 15 minutes of the game</a> to a popular subreddit, only for the footage to be taken down within hours. As such, it's a certain bet that spoilers for the game are out there, so if you're trying to go in with fresh eyes, keep a lookout.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Callisto Protocol is a sci-fi horror game from Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield, and it looks to be very much in the same vein as that franchise. The game was recently cancelled in Japan due to its violence and gore. Schofield recently took to Twitter to explain that none of The Callisto Protocol's main game content would be <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-isnt-removing-main-game-content-for-the-season-pass-dev-promises/1100-6509483/\">hidden behind DLC paywalls</a>, after a description of the DLC made some players believe that they were missing out on death animations intended for the main campaign. Schofield clarified that these death animations have not been created yet, and that they will be specific to the DLC.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-hours-of-the-callisto-protocol-leaks-online/1100-6509543/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-playstation-plus-ps5-and-ps4-games-for-december-2022-leaked/1100-6509541/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Free PlayStation Plus PS5 And PS4 Games For December 2022 Leaked", "date_published": "2022-11-29 15:00:00+00:00", "description": "<p>December 2022's free PlayStation Plus games lineup has seemingly leaked ahead of time, and members are in for some big-name titles coming up soon, including one brand-new release.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.dealabs.com/bons-plans/ps-essential-mass-effect-legendary-edition-biomutant-et-divine-knockout-offerts-sur-ps5-ps4-dematerialises-2457113\">Dealabs user billbil-kun reports</a> that Mass Effect Legendary Edition, Biomutant, and Divine Knockout will be free for PS5 and PS4 subscribers to PlayStation Plus in December.
