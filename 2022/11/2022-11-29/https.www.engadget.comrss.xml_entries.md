<p>Nintendo has released a <a href="https://youtu.be/TnGl01FkMMo">new trailer</a> for its upcoming <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> movie. After the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/super-mario-bros-movie-first-trailer-203221015.html">short teaser</a> the gaming giant offered at the start of last month, the new clip offers a better insight into what fans can expect from the film. Not only do we hear more of Chris Pratt as Mario, but we also see Anya Taylor-Joy and Seth Rogan make appearances as Princess Peach and Donkey Kong. Oh, and the best part is that the film will include a nod to the Mario Kart series with a visit to Rainbow Road.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Mario and Zelda series creator Shigeru Miyamoto, Nintendo redesigned Donkey Kong's model for the first time since the loveable ape made the jump to 3D in 1994's <em>Donkey Kong Country. </em>"Some of you may have noticed, but for this movie, we seized the opportunity to give a comical personality and design reminiscent of the original character," Miyamoto said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="6e56b85392b44dd986a8bbf7c3b87266"></div><p>With the exception of Chris Pratt's voice acting, everything else about the movie seems delightful. The animation is colorful and fluid, and it's great to see so many nods to other Mario games. It's also fun to see Mario cast as a bumbling newbie. Whether <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>will be worth the cost of admission we'll have to wait until April 7th, 2023 to find out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Netflix <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/all-the-new-mobile-games-on-netflix-in-november">has added</a> three new mobile games to its catalog, and they're eclectic... with a distinctly feline theme.

## 'Pong' is now half a century old

<p>Exactly 50 years ago today, Atari released <em>Pong</em>. It wasn’t the first video game ever created, nor the original take on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey">virtual table tennis</a> – a fact that would eventually lead to two decades of lawsuits. But in <em>Pong,</em> the early video game industry was born. Released in 1972, Atari sold more than 8,000 <em>Pong </em>arcade cabinets. A few years later, the home version of<em> Pong </em>would become an instant success, with Sears selling about 150,000 units of the console you needed to play the game.</p><p>Those are modest sales numbers by 2022 standards, but the success of <em>Pong</em> and <em>Home Pong </em>gave Atari the resources and expertise needed to create the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-atari-2600-set-143936829.html">Atari 2600</a>. The second-generation console went on to sell more than 30 million units before the end of 2004. All things considered, pretty good for a project that was only meant to be a training exercise for designer Allan Alcorn, who was 24 at the time and had no prior video game experience. And if not for <em>Pong</em>, Nintendo would not exist, and a young <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)">Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak</a> may have not gone on to create Apple.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Happy birthday, <em>Pong, </em>and thank you for inspiring countless sequels and knockoffs, as well as the careers of an entire generation of video game designers.&nbsp;</p>

## PlayStation brings its eSports tournaments to PS5 with easy to join events

<p>Sony's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-20-sony-jumps-into-esports-with-playstation-tournaments.html">PlayStation Tournaments</a> are finally <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2022/11/29/playstation-tournaments-on-ps5-officially-launches-today/">available</a> to play on PS5, and the biggest upgrade may simply be the greater chance of joining an event. The eSports-for-everyone feature now centers around shorter tourneys at regular intervals — it should be easier to find a competition that fits your life. Sony will even create multiple brackets to keep the duration in check. You can sign up directly from your console, too, so you won't have to head to another device just to get started.</p><p>The new PlayStation Tournaments system also boasts a revamped interface that takes advantage of PS5 activity cards and notifications to help you find events, track (automatically updated) results, and let you know when it's time to play.  You can locate competitions from games' home screen sections. And if you'd like to do more than just compete, a Discord community hub promises both chat as well as hosted interviews and game sessions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="PlayStation Tournaments PS5 cards" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/a69a5530-7020-11ed-adfd-62e5934051e3" style="height: 865; width: 1920;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>Anyone in an eligible country with a PlayStation Plus membership can join, with the first PS5 tournaments focusing on <em>FIFA 23</em>, <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> and <em>NBA 2K23</em>. Prizes range from in-game currency through to cash, PlayStation hardware and "experiences." To reel you in, Sony is running a "Win-A-Thon" leaderboard event between December 1st and January 31st that rewards you the better you fare in regional tournaments. The promo will also be available to PS4 owners.</p><p>As with Microsoft's<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-16-microsoft-makes-a-big-bet-on-esports-with-xbox-live-tournaments.html"> Xbox Live tournaments</a>, the PlayStation eSports offering is meant to keep you engaged and spending money. You might be more likely to buy the latest sports title if you know you can win real-world rewards. Even so, the PS5 expansion might be helpful by making eSports more accessible to current-gen console owners.</p>

<p>Two months after its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ddos-attack-overwatch-2-050328450.html"><ins>chaotic launch</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ddos-attack-overwatch-2-050328450.html"><em><ins>Overwatch 2</ins></em></a> is in a much <a href="https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2-prepaid-phone-numbers-201522758.html"><ins>healthier place</ins></a> and Blizzard is gearing up for the game's second season. A gameplay trailer for the season, which starts on December 6th and will introduce another new tank character, provides a glimpse of an upcoming limited-time mode. It's called Battle for Olympus and it will run from January 5th until January 19th.</p><p>Blizzard only offered a brief look at Battle for Olympus in <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PXJFSlZPeHpqeVEwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3MzI5ZmU1OS0wOGFiLTQ5OGQtYTZhMi04YzU4MmEyZTNkNDMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXtylOIAA7MKxXiMn3PzPdixYGOOD7n86GVo4gkkYThA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrEJVOxzjyQ0"><ins>the trailer</ins></a>, but it takes place on a revamped version of the Ilios map and shows Roadhog firing rocks (instead of his usual scrap) and Junker Queen raining lightning down onto the battlefield. To wit, <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23878812/"><ins>Blizzard says</ins></a> heroes will be "imbued with awesome god-like powers" in this mode.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="be0ef56aa6c743dfaf168059eba7104c"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Speaking of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2-free-to-play-early-access-date-174155851.html"><ins>Junker Queen</ins></a>, the tank who joined the lineup when <em>Overwatch 2</em> launched, she's the recipient of a mythic skin in season two, which (perhaps unsurprisingly) has a Greek mythology theme. The Zeus look has customizable parts and new weapon models, voice lines and special effects. That rad skin is the reward for reaching level 80 of the next battle pass.</p><p>The Winter Wonderland and Lunar New Year events will return during the season as well, and they'll feature fresh skins. During last month's Halloween event, there was no way for players to earn new event skins for free, which led to a backlash from players. However, Blizzard has said that, <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23875435/"><ins>starting in season two</ins></a>, every event will have a skin that fans can unlock by simply playing the game — just like they could in the <em>Overwatch 1</em> days.</p><p>The trailer also offered a look at the new escort map for season two, Shambali Monastery, where Zenyatta and the latest tank hero, Ramattra, used to live (a deeper dive into the map is coming later this week). Ramattra is the game's first so-called "tempo" tank. He can change forms and gain access to alternate abilities. He's all about closing the gap between his team and the enemy. Ramattra will initially be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2-heroes-battle-pass-blizzard-204021282.html"><ins>gated behind the season two battle pass</ins></a>. Buying the premium battle pass will unlock him instantly, but you'll need to grind through the ranks to claim him for free.</p><div id="17dbc3089130401aadaa30ed8dc9a21f"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Elsewhere, Blizzard will rotate the map selection for the core game modes. Two maps, Oasis and Nepal, will be playable at different times of day. Balance changes for some heroes are on the way and those who miss out on unlocking Sojourn, Junker Queen and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2-battle-pass-explained-pricing-rewards-164051102.html">Kiriko</a> in season one will be able to add them to their roster by winning a certain number of games.</p>

<p>If history is anything to go on, Google won’t announce the next entry in its Pixel A series until I/O 2023. That means we could be waiting as much as six months before the company is ready to share any substantial information on the device. Of course, that’s not stopping the rumor mill from getting an early start on leaking details about the Pixel 7a.</p><p>Over on <a href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/google-pixel-7a-first-look-revealed/"><em><ins>Smartprix</ins></em></a> (via <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-7a-first-look/"><em><ins>XDA Developers</ins></em></a>), Steve Hemmerstoffer of <a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks"><ins>OnLeaks fame</ins></a> has shared early renders of the upcoming device.

According to <em>Smartprix</em>, the dimensions of the new device are nearly identical to the Pixel 6a, with the former reportedly coming in at 10.1mm thick at the camera bump. The phone also looks to feature relatively thin bezels, a not-so-prominent chin and a center display cutout for the selfie camera.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Pixel 7a" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/ba346220-7016-11ed-affc-78eeaf548e7d" style="height: 1200; width: 1600;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Hemmerstoffer</div></figure><p>Notably, the renders indicate the Pixel 7a will feature a SIM tray on its left side, suggesting – at least for the time being – Google won’t follow Apple’s decision to go all in on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-14-sim-card-195422014.html"><ins>eSIM</ins></a>. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like the search giant has decided to bring back the headphone jack; the analog port is nowhere to be found on the Pixel 7a.</p><p>The more interesting aspects of the Pixel 7a may be features that don’t show up in renders. According to <em>Smartprix</em>, the phone is likely to feature a 90Hz display from Samsung and an upgraded main camera sensor from Sony. It could also be the first Pixel A series phone to feature wireless charging. That's about all we know about the device at the moment. However, we’re certain to get a fuller picture of the Pixel 7a as more information leaks, or when Google decides to get ahead of the rumor mill like it did with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-12-google-pixel-4-camera-official-leak.html"><ins>Pixel 4</ins></a>.</p>

## NASA's Orion photographed the Earth and Moon from a quarter-million miles away

<p>The Orion spacecraft's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-orion-spacecraft-break-apollo-13-flight-record-172235996.html">record-setting distance from Earth</a> made for stunning photography, apparently.  NASA has <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasa2explore/52529813962/">shared</a> a photo taken by the Artemis I vehicle on Monday showing both Earth and the Moon in the background. Much like some Apollo photography or Voyager 1's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot">Pale Blue Dot</a>," the picture puts humanity's home in perspective — our world is just one small planet in a much larger cosmos.</p><p>Orion took the snapshot around its maximum distance from Earth of 268,563 miles. That's the farthest any human-oriented spacecraft has traveled, beating even Apollo 13's record of 248,655 miles from 1970. Notably, Artemis I represents the first time explorers intended to travel this far out — Apollo 13 only ventured so far from Earth because NASA's emergency flight plan required the Moon as a slingshot.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Ars Technica</em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/11/orion-flies-far-beyond-the-moon-returns-an-instantly-iconic-photo/">notes</a> that this early Artemis flight has so far surpassed NASA's expectations. While the mission team has only completed 31 out of 124 core objectives so far, it's adding goals like extended thruster tests. About half of the remaining activities are in progress, with the rest largely dependent on returning to Earth.</p><p>Orion is expected to splash down off the San Diego coast on December 11th. The Artemis program has dealt with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-nasas-latest-artemis-1-launch-attempt-here-020044428.html">numerous delays</a>, and now isn't expected to land humans on the Moon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-artemis-1-rocket-wet-dress-rehersal-fourth-attempt-161434385.html">until 2025 or 2026</a>.

At the top of the page, you'll see a stories-style highlight reel including how many minutes you've spent listening to music and your top song, artist, album and genres of the year. Further down the page are the lists of your top 10 songs, artists and albums, and your top five playlists. What's more, you'll see if you're in the top 100 listeners for a certain artist.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can share your highlight reel or other stats on social platforms or with friends. There are share buttons dotted throughout Replay on iOS and tapping one brings up the usual share sheet. Curiously, Apple Music's desktop web player doesn't feature share buttons, which makes it slightly more difficult for me to share just how much Rammstein and Taylor Swift I've been listening to this year.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple Music has released <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vbXVzaWMuYXBwbGUuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODg3OTdkMzktZTAyYS00NTU5LWJhYjgtM2UxMWNlM2IwZjEwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYN3pV6Y4MrEYbXnM8RUauxPPKpk8GDm0fy8cYcl4IC8&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2F"><ins>its year-end charts</ins></a>, including the most Shazamed songs of the year.

## Twitter has stopped enforcing its COVID-19 misinformation policy

<p>Twitter's long-running effort to <a href="https://search.engadget.com/click/_ylt=AwrNYTNyC4ZjmqMLHUx8BWVH;_ylu=Y29sbwNiZjEEcG9zAzEEdnRpZAMEc2VjA3Nj/RV=2/RE=1669757938/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.engadget.com%2ftwitter-miselading-information-coronavirus-covid-19-180714699.html/RK=2/RS=mKFX.Gv6ZdO1ydLsFv_yXCtYM.g-">fight COVID-19 misinformation</a> is at an end, at least for now. As Twitter users and <em>CNN</em><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/29/tech/twitter-covid-misinformation-policy/">noticed</a>, the social media firm has quietly <a href="https://transparency.twitter.com/en/reports/covid19.html#2021-jul-dec">updated</a> its transparency site to reveal that it stopped enforcing its COVID misinformation policy on November 23rd. It's not clear if the company will restore any accounts banned for sharing misinformation as part of Elon Musk's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-engineers-fired-holiday-pay-amnesty-elon-musk-210356513.html">planned amnesty</a>, but this indicates that the company won't suspend further users or delete content including falsehoods about the coronavirus or vaccines.</p><p>Twitter started cracking down on COVID-19 misinformation in January 2020, as the disease began spreading worldwide. The social network has since banned over 11,200 accounts, pulled over 97,600 examples of false content and "challenged" 11.7 million accounts through efforts like warning labels. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy even <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-misinformation-advisory.pdf">pointed</a> to the company's policy as an example of how other technology platforms could fight bogus medical claims.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company has effectively disbanded its communications team and isn't available for comment. However, Musk has routinely voiced his opposition to bans and some COVID-19 safety measures. Tesla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-restarts-production-211807400.html">defied early pandemic lockdowns</a> by keeping factories open despite shelter-in-place orders. Musk also insisted during an April 2020 earnings call that these lockdowns were "forcibly imprisoning people," and threatened to move Tesla's headquarters from California to Texas in response. While the entrepreneur supports vaccination, he opposes mandates and voiced support for the anti-mandate occupiers that shut down the Canadian capital city of Ottawa for weeks.</p><p>The news comes amid reports Twitter is scaling back other teams dedicated to catching toxic behavior. <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-29/musk-s-cuts-decimated-twitter-team-tackling-child-sexual-abuse?sref=10lNAhZ9">sources</a> claim Musk has gutted the team dedicated to fighting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) as part of his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-done-with-job-cuts-blue-verified-062148989.html">wide-ranging layoffs</a>, cutting it from roughly 20 specialists to less than 10. The contacts say that the unit was already strained before, but is now "overwhelmed" despite Musk's <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1595671290421170179?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1595671290421170179%7Ctwgr%5E7d252cd0a8a05b6ad1179180fcb25ac284242d12%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2022-11-29%2Fmusk-s-cuts-decimated-twitter-team-tackling-child-sexual-abuse">assertion</a> that fighting child exploitation is "priority #1." This could put Twitter in legal jeopardy as it's frequently required by law to remove CSAM — the UK's Online Safety Bill lets regulators fine companies if they don't move quickly to pull offending content.</p><p>The cutbacks may have also limited Twitter's ability to fend off bots and other fake accounts. The tech giant  struggled to curb spam <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-spam-hides-china-covid-protests-152534633.html">obscuring news of Chinese protests</a> after Musk laid off Twitter's anti-propaganda team, for example.</p>

## Amazon’s Create With Alexa generates unique animated children’s stories on Echo Show

But Amazon’s entry into the AI art world is a bit different.

The AI then generates an illustrated five-to-ten-line narrative — including animations, sound effects and music — built around their answers.</p><p>Amazon’s generative AI has a narrow scope at launch, with only three themes available: “space exploration”, “underwater” and “enchanted forest.” After picking one, children choose the story’s hero from options like “an astronaut named Speedy” or “an alien named Fuzzy.” Your child can then pick a color scheme and a tonal description like silly, happy or mysterious. Afterwards, they can save their stories to watch again later or share them with friends and family.</p><figure><img alt="Alexa lets children choose a hero at the center of their story." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/bafd31d0-6aaf-11ed-bfb3-acdb75fc4bba" style="height: 800; width: 1280;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>This isn’t a case of Alexa splicing together ready-made scenes. Amazon says no two AI-created stories will be the same, even if your child repeats the process with identical prompts</p><p>According to Amazon, Create With Alexa includes safeguards to ensure the feature only produces kid-friendly content. “From the get-go, we used carefully curated data sources to train AI models,” Eshan Bhatnagar, head of product for Alexa AI, said in a blog post today. “We have multiple guardrails such as content filtering and curated prompts to ensure this experience is both delightful and safe.” Additionally, Create with Alexa requires parents to enable the feature before their kids can use it.</p><p>Create With Alexa arrives in an atmosphere of uncertainty surrounding Amazon’s voice assistant. Earlier this month, the retail giant confirmed it had begun laying off employees, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-layoffs-report-191003720.html"><ins>reportedly slashing</ins></a> around 10,000 jobs. Its Devices &amp; Services division, which handles Echo Show and Alexa, reportedly bore the brunt of it.

<p>Sony has launched an interesting product called <a href="https://www.sony.jp/CorporateCruise/Press/202211/22-1129/">Mocopi</a>, consisting of six motion-tracking bands worn on your hands, feet, back and head, with a price of 49,500 yen (about $358). The aim is to let you track your body to create videos or operate avatars in real time with metaverse apps like VRChat. It even offers an SDK that lets you import motion data into 3D animation apps.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently a play on the term "mocap," (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-07-14-motion-capture-explainer.html">motion capture</a>) Mocopi's six color-coded, lightweight motion sensors use "proprietary technology and a smartphone" with a dedicated app, according to Sony. "Normally, video production using motion capture requires dedicated equipment and operators," Sony wrote. "By utilizing our proprietary algorithm, 'Mocopi' realizes highly accurate motion measurement with a small number of sensors, freeing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber">VTubers</a> [virtual YouTubers] and creators involved in movie and animation production from time and place constraints."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="1aeb3047258e427c807db04c2fc51ab3"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>On December 15th, Sony will provide a software development kit (SDK) that links the motion capture data with metaverse services, along with the real-time development platform <a href="https://www.engadget.com/unity-weta-digital-acquisition-231256259.html">Unity</a> and Autodesk's animation/mocap app <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=391d1b55-7611-44fb-b248-64dc5a6ce032&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Autodesk&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzOTFkMWI1NS03NjExLTQ0ZmItYjI0OC02NGRjNWE2Y2UwMzIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXV0b2Rlc2suY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL21vdGlvbmJ1aWxkZXIvb3ZlcnZpZXc_dGVybT0xLVlFQVImdGFiPXN1YnNjcmlwdGlvbiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmE1NzkzMDMtZjE0Zi00NTEwLTgwNTktMjM2ZDdhNjNlYmVjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdvjdKdO626nNgM7XjfH9yXFnHpEfQ7xGMoYHzp7cGT9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autodesk.com%2Fproducts%2Fmotionbuilder%2Foverview%3Fterm%3D1-YEAR%26tab%3Dsubscription">MotionBuilder</a>. "This SDK expands the use of motion data for activities such as full-body tracking, thereby facilitating the development of new services in areas such as the metaverse and fitness."</p><p>In a how-to video (below), Sony shows how you can pair the sensors with the app, strap them to your body and calibrate them. From there, you can start dancing or do other movements and see the in-app avatars ape your actions. A second video showcasing some avatar animations (above) looks good, but does reveal typical motion capture issues like jitter and foot sliding.&nbsp;</p><div id="undefined"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>It's an ambitious product aimed at not only people interested in the metaverse, but animation professionals and filmmakers as well.

Reservations are set to start in mid-December 2022 and it will go on sale in late January 2023, but there's no word yet on North American availability.&nbsp;</p>

## The Morning After: Elon Musk says Apple has 'threatened to withhold’ Twitter app

According to Musk, the company “won’t tell us why” it has issues with the social network’s app. In subsequent tweets, he railed against Apple’s 30 percent “tax” on in-app purchases and claimed the App Store owner has “censored” other developers. He also said Apple “has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter.” Apple hasn’t yet responded to a request for comment. Musk also hasn’t specified if the company is holding updates to the service or threatening to remove the app from its store altogether.</p><p>Apple has strict, if often unevenly enforced, rules that govern the content in apps in its store.

<p>BeReal, the new social media app that exploded in popularity over the past few months, is one of the biggest winners for this year's <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL25ld3Nyb29tLzIwMjIvMTEvYXBwLXN0b3JlLWF3YXJkcy1jZWxlYnJhdGUtdGhlLWJlc3QtYXBwcy1hbmQtZ2FtZXMtb2YtMjAyMi8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjVhODA5OThjLTUxODUtNGNiOC04NzRlLWI2MTBjMzYxNjYyNSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQ5R0aPmjFcnoGL0qtGYVKEsu47IUZ8VRc2KdBb8B9Xv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2022%2F11%2Fapp-store-awards-celebrate-the-best-apps-and-games-of-2022%2F">Apple's App Store Awards</a>. It won iPhone App of the Year for giving people an authentic glimpse into their friend's and family's every day lives, the tech giant said in its announcement. In all, Apple highlighted 16 apps and games for 2022 that delivered "exceptional experiences and [made] a profound cultural impact."</p><p>In BeReal's case, the fact that other social media apps had introduced or are testing features similar to what it does is a clear testament to the "impact" it's had on the space. BeReal users can share a selfie of themselves with a photo of their environment during a two-minute window that the app randomly selects for them every day. A reverse engineer found an experimental feature that's basically identical to that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-bereal-candid-challenges-232117658.html">within Instagram</a> back in August, while TikTok <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-now-daily-photo-video-143400837.html">unveiled</a> its own take on the format in September.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another big winner is GoodNotes 5, which was named the iPad App of the Year for taking digital notes "to the next level with best-in-class Apple Pencil support." Users can treat their iPads like any book or notebook with the app, since it allows them to jot down notes on the margin and highlight important text, among other things.&nbsp;</p><p>MacFamilyTree 10 won Mac App of the year for its ability to create virtually stunning family trees and giving users the capability to collaborate with relatives around the world, while ViX, the Spanish-language streaming service by TelevisaUnivision, won Apple TV App of the Year. Yet another winner is fitness tracker Gentler Streak, which took home the Apple Watch App of the Year award.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For games, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apex-legends-mobile-may-17-155111815.html"><em>Apex Legends Mobile</em></a> bested all the other titles for the iPhone, while puzzle game <em>Moncage</em> and  card battler <em>Inscryption</em> won best games for the iPad and the Mac, respectively. The Wild West stealth game <em>El Hijo</em> won best game for Apple TV for looking exceptional on a big screen. <em>Wylde Flowers</em>, a life sim that combines farming with magic, was named as the best Apple Arcade game. Finally, esports simulator <em>League of Legends Esports Manager</em> won the first China Game of the Year award.</p><p>In addition to the main winners, Apple also highlighted five apps for impacting people's lives and influencing culture. Those apps include <em>How We Feel</em>, which encourages users to record their emotional well-being to help them better vocalize it, and <em>Dot's Home</em>, a time-traveling story that puts a spotlight on systemic housing injustices. <em>Locket Widget </em>can help forge connections between people by letting users send live photos to their friend's and family's home screen, while <em>Waterllama</em> makes keeping hydrated fun. There's also<em> Inua - A Story in Ice and Time</em>, which takes users on an adventure rich in Inuit folklore and traditions.&nbsp;</p>
