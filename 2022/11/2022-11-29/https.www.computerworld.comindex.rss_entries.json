Neither is quite true.</p><h2><strong>App Store fees: A negotiation in progress</strong></h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s begin with App Store fees.\u00a0At present, some developers must pay Apple 30% of from sales of their software or from subscription income. Not all developers do so \u2014 in the second year, subscription fees drop to 15% of the take, while developers shifting <a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3631529/developers-regulators-say-apples-app-store-changes-dont-do-enough.html\">under a million dollars in value</a> also pay just 15%.

No, even worse than the technical land mines ahead for Twitter are billionaire Elon Musk's management blunders.</p><p>I know, some of you are saying, \"Musk is a genius!
