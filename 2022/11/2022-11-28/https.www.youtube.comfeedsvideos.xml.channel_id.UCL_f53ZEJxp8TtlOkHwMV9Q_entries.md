Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Congressman Mike Johnson discuss the current state of conservative America, the understated importance of inherent value, the trumped up climate crisis and the all too real crisis facing much of Europe this coming winter.
 
Rep. Mike Johnson is in his third term representing the 4th Congressional District of Louisiana. He represents nearly 760,000 residents of 15 parishes in the northwest and western regions of the state. Mike was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives on December 10, 2016, by the largest margin of victory in his region in more than 50 years and is currently serving his third term. He earned his undergraduate degree in Business Administration from Louisiana State University in 1995, and then his Juris Doctorate from the Paul M. Hebert Law Center at Louisiana State University in 1998. Before joining Congress, Johnson was a partner in the Kitchens Law Firm and a senior attorney and national media spokesman for the Alliance Defense Fund, now known as Alliance Defending Freedom.  He serves as the Vice Chairman of the House Republican Conference—the No. 4 ranked Republican in Congress—is a leader on the Judiciary and Armed Services Committees, and serves as an Assistant Whip for House Republicans. Last Congress, he served as Chairman of the Republican Study Committee, known as the "intellectual arsenal" and the largest caucus of conservatives in Congress. Prior to becoming elected to the U.S. Congress, Johnson served as a constitutional law litigator for nearly 20 years.
