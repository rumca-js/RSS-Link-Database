<p>An eagerly-awaited clash of two talented and tempestuous heavyweights failed to meet expectations but the repercussions could prove fatal for Uruguay. Portugal eased into the last 16 courtesy of two goals from Bruno Fernandes to leave the South Americans needing to beat Ghana on Friday to have a chance of joining them. Revenge will be high on the agenda for Ghana.</p><p>Fernandes scored two second half goals – though Cristiano Ronaldo continued to claim the first as his own long after the final whistle – and could have had a hat-trick during a relatively tame encounter. Uruguay are now bottom of the group and need maximum points against Ghana, who they infamously knocked out of the 2010 World Cup courtesy of Luis Suárez’s handball and Asamoah Gyan’s penalty miss, plus a favour from Portugal against South Korea to avoid an ignominious early exit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/28/portugal-uruguay-world-cup-group-h-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

I’m a football coach,” said Gregg Berhalter, but he was a man who had just been exposed to politics in the raw. Twenty-four hours before his side’s definitive Group B fixture against Iran, the USA head coach had been hit by a fusillade of hostile questioning from Iranian media. Everything from censorship to American racism and the presence of the US fleet in the Gulf was thrown at him. It was an experience he will never have had before and few coaches will encounter.</p><p>It was not entirely unpredictable, however. The complicated and bloody history that exists between Iran and the USA has led to simple sporting encounters between the two nations becoming diplomatic flashpoints. It was the case when the countries first faced each other at the World Cup during France 98 and, in a different way, it has happened again now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/28/usa-coach-gregg-berhalter-quizzed-on-political-situation-by-irans-media">Continue reading...</a>

## Kudus doubles up to edge Ghana past South Korea in World Cup thriller

<p>Ghana’s task is now clear: bury the ghosts of Soccer City and reach the knockout stage. Victory over Uruguay, who defeated them so heartbreakingly on that climactic night in 2010, would complete the job and on present form drama seems a given. A rollercoaster evening’s work against South Korea brought a two-goal lead, courtesy of Mohammed Salisu and Mohammed Kudus, before a pair of fine headers from Cho Gue-sung pegged them back. Kudus, the gifted Ajax forward, had the final say and the details only partly convey a compelling, intensely absorbing spectacle. South Korea retain interest in the competition but must now beat Portugal and hold their breath.</p><p>The early tempo spoke of what would follow. It was set by South Korea, who flew forward and showed no hint of the tribulations they would soon face. They had won seven corners by the 18 minute mark: none brought a clear chance but Ghana were forced to defend scrappily as shots and headers rained in. Jeong Woo-yeong saw a drive deflected wide and Son Heung-min, warming to life in a mask, found clean air with an overhead kick. Son had already tricked to the line with one run down the left, outsmarting Tariq Lamptey on the Brighton player’s first World Cup start.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/28/south-korea-ghana-world-cup-group-h-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s insurance renewal time again – when I discuss cover in New York, hear tales of NHS woe in the UK, and wonder which is worse</p><p>For the second time since moving to the US 15 years ago, I had to call 911 this week. The first time, six years ago, was when smoke poured into the elevator from a fire in the laundry room and four fire trucks arrived within minutes. This week, it was to request an ambulance for a sick neighbour. Between dialling the number, and a gurney and two paramedics materialising in our hallway, was approximately seven minutes. I found myself thinking something I used to think about the NHS: what an amazing service.</p><p>My understanding, at this distance, is that most ambulances in the UK <a href="https://www.health.org.uk/publications/long-reads/why-have-ambulance-waiting-times-been-getting-worse">do not show up in under 10 minutes</a>, even when the emergency is dire.

<p>Director Kevin Kopacka indulges the sensually rich if narratively flawed world of giallo and fantastique cinema, with enjoyable if problematic results</p><p>From the atmospheric lighting that drips in primary colours to the spooky setting of a gothic castle in ruins, the retro aesthetics of Kevin Kopacka’s second feature pay tribute to the twisted pleasures of 1960s and 1970s European horror movies: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/aug/16/giallo-horror-suspiria-argento-censor">giallo</a>, fantastique, and the like. Ruled by emotional as well as physical dysfunction, this film opens with an ill-fated car trip taken by an overbearing husband and his reticent wife to an abandoned country estate which the latter has inherited.</p><p>The dilapidated condition of the isolated location eerily mirrors the deteriorating mental states of the characters. Even if the plotting is intended as pastiche, the visuals maintain an impressive balance between homage and distinctiveness. Nevertheless, just when viewers might think they know what’s coming, the film suddenly lifts the curtain on its own smoke and mirrors, like a magician revealing his tricks. Without giving too much away, the unexpected rupturing of make-believe finds the narrative splintering in numerous directions, ultimately painting a fragmented portrait of toxic love.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/28/dawn-breaks-behind-the-eyes-review-cult-status-beckons-for-euro-horror-homage">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rishi Sunak has gloated at the supreme court’s rebuff to Nicola Sturgeon. He’d be better off fashioning a proper devolution deal</p><p>England never gets Scotland right.

He merely reinforced her party’s antipathy to London and all its doings.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2022-0098.html">court’s decision</a> was legally robust but politically inept. Sturgeon’s poll would have been purely advisory. The court appeared to be saying that independence was a forbidden subject to Scottish opinion, lending force to her claim that “the notion of the UK as a voluntary partnership of nations … is no longer a reality”. In the unlikely event of the Scots “advising” another referendum, then real questions might be asked as to what independence involved.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/28/scots-europe-scottish-protocol-rishi-sunak-supreme-court-nicola-sturgeon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Anime tells a familiar tale about boyhood friendship and childhood gangs but does so with genuinely intense feeling</p><p>Here is a beautifully gentle and melancholy coming-of-age YA adventure from the Japanese animator Atsuko Ishizuka. The story will be instantly familiar: a tale of boyhood friendship coming to an end – or shifting into a new phase perhaps, less intense. There is nothing new to see here, and yet it’s a deeply felt film, romantic and earnest about childhood. Though I have to admit I found the subtitling hard to follow in places; the dubbed version might be a better choice, especially for younger audiences.</p><p>The narrator is called Roma; he is remembering the summer when he was 15, living on a farm. The other kids in the village laugh at him, and call him “cow dung guy”. His best friend is serious, hardworking Toto (Yûki Kaji) who has been away at school in Tokyo. Now Toto is back for the holidays with a new boyband haircut and a slight air of disdain for his country bumpkin friend. The pair have been inseparable for years; they built a secret den in the woods and called themselves the Don Glees gang (the name is explained later).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/28/goodbye-don-glees-review-stunningly-animated-film-is-affecting-ya-adventure">Continue reading...</a>

<p>You could make lovely gifts of this quince cheese for spreading like jam or enjoying with salty cheese</p><p>It was my partner Vincenzo’s great aunt who made <em>cotognata</em>. The youngest of five siblings, all of whom had their own families, it was both her speciality and responsibility. Every autumn, in her kitchen in Gela on the south coast of Sicily, she cooked kilos and kilos of <em>mela cotogna </em>(quince) down to a puree and passed it though a hand-cranked food mill, before bringing it back to a boil with lemon juice and sugar. Once the mixture reached the setting point (a dense, molten state that burped and spat at passing children), it was poured into terracotta or tin moulds and left to set to a firm jelly. Every mould was patterned inside, so, when turned out, the forms had a raised decoration, possibly recognisable as flowers, grapes, swirls or an angel.</p><p>Some were dusted with sugar, others not; either way, they were left to dry for a few more days. How cotognata is dried is personal, an everlasting competition the cook has with herself: colour, consistency, how firm, how dry … Some people swear by a sunny table outside, while a cool oven is also an option; Vincenzo’s great aunt used every spare surface in the house for hers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/nov/28/sicilian-quince-paste-recipe-cotognata-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From the aristocratic boutiques of 18th-century Paris to a zombified consumerist dystopia, our culture critics help you shop till you drop</p><p>George A Romero’s 1968 horror film Night of the Living Dead is one of the most inspired critiques of consumerism in movie history. It is about a zombie uprising caused by a virus from outer space, causing dead people to rise from the grave, driven by a hunger for living human flesh. The film satirises 1960s America’s consumerism: people existing in a catatonic state of hunger and thirst and hostility; a metaphor made explicit in the later Dawn of the Dead (1978), set in a shopping mall. Now, in the era of social media, it’s even more relevant. All of us scrolling endlessly through our phones, looking dully through material covertly curated by commercial algorithms.

<p>Hornby draws parallels between the Victorian novelist and the musician in this heartfelt homage to these brilliant, driven individuals</p><p>At the start of this heartfelt exercise in hero worship, Nick Hornby gathers together a throng of what he calls “My People” and ushers them into a VIP room in his head. They make up an eclectic pantheon, with Arsène Wenger jostling <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/03/janet-malcolm-the-last-interview-joan-didion-the-last-interview-review-crafty-to-the-end">Joan Didion</a> and the sitcom scriptwriters Galton and Simpson next to the gloomy painter Edward Hopper. Dickens and Prince are “two among many” in the gilded crowd, but Hornby singles them out for special homage. Dickens rescued him from the stupor of adolescence by showing that books were an escape route for the mind; Prince, with his keening falsetto, the prestidigitation of his guitar-playing and his hyperkinetic dance moves, delivered a physical excitement that is music’s special prerogative. Dickens made Hornby laugh, while Prince thrilled him by seeming to offer “hours of erotic ecstasy”.</p><p>That said, the pair have not much in common, apart from their almost crazed productivity. Hornby traces parallels between their professional lives – the deprived childhoods that fuelled their ambition, their precocious fame, their shrewd management of later setbacks in their careers – but can’t find many private affinities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/28/dickens-prince-a-particular-kind-of-genius-by-nick-hornby-review-a-tale-of-two-greats">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Liu Ximei, who was diagnosed with HIV at 10, is shown as a dauntless campaigner whose home provides a warm haven for patients still neglected in China </p><p>Produced by Ai Weiwei, this is a rousing portrait of Liu Ximei, an astonishingly resilient Aids activist; it also sheds light on a controversial government campaign that accelerated the epidemic in 1990s China. During the first half of the decade, poor farmers were encouraged to donate their blood in exchange for money. Due to a lack of health and safety standards, a staggering number of donors as well as those who received transfusions contracted HIV. In Ximei’s province of Henan, more than 300,000 villagers live with the debilitating effects of the condition, all while facing societal discrimination and neglect.</p><p>In following Ximei’s day-to-day routines, the film captures the gruelling reality of simply making your voice heard in an environment that is determined to strip HIV-positive people of their humanity. The lively thread that binds this stigmatised community together, Ximei makes endless trips to the central hospital where she demands better medical treatment on behalf of other HIV-positive people, many of whom are elderly and illiterate. In contrast to the indifference of government officials, the warm atmosphere of Ximei’s home, a haven for those living with HIV, attests to the importance of community and grassroots organisation. Ximei herself was abandoned by her birth parents; later, when she was diagnosed with HIV at the age of 10 after a blood transfusion, it was her foster family that nurtured her sense of compassion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/28/ximei-review-ai-weiwei-produced-inspiring-portrait-of-chinese-aids-activist">Continue reading...</a>

Standing on the table is figure in a long gown and orange balaclava, like Rasputin in women’s clothes, or a very unorthodox priest. The figure raises their skirts and a jet of urine spurts over the portrait.</p><p>Welcome to Reykjavík and to Velvet Terrorism, an exhibition tracing the decade-long history of Russian art collective Pussy Riot. “Is that you?” I ask Maria Alyokhina, AKA Masha, pointing at the masked urinator?

<p>The World Cup favourites showed enough in their win against Serbia to suggest they can perform well against Switzerland even without their star player</p><p>Brazil had a decent start to their 2022 World Cup. The first game of the tournament is always a little bit more difficult. An early wrong turn, a miscontrolled ball or a badly placed pass can dictate the story of the game. A team that wants to go on to win the tournament need to realise that and manage the raw emotions and the overall energy of those first minutes. Brazil did that in their 2-0 win against Serbia. But let’s be careful. The three points does not guarantee anything, not even progress to the knockout stage. The players need to know that humility and respect is key here and you can never have too much of that.</p><p>Now comes a game against another European competitor, Switzerland. Football is exciting because we will never be able to fully understand it, but a win on Monday and early qualification for the second round is what the coach, Tite, is after. Then he could use the third game to rotate the squad somewhat and try a few different tactical things for the battles ahead.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/nov/28/world-cup-qatar-brazil-look-unified-and-have-strength-in-depth-to-cope-without-neymar">Continue reading...</a>

They do not think of human beings as a herd to be fed and watered… They think of them as individuals cooperating together to make a fine collective life.”</p><p><em>All In: How We Build a Country That Works</em> is an attempt to revive that ethos for 21st-century Britain, making the case for a democratic revolution to address a seemingly endless political crisis. Amid signs that a top-down managerialist approach is back in fashion in Downing Street, after Johnsonian chaos and the wild follies of Trussonomics, it feels like a much-needed intervention.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/28/all-in-how-we-build-country-that-works-by-lisa-nandy-review-why-labour-must-give-power-to-the-people">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Grigoris Karantinakis’s bustling ensemble drama recreates the buildup to a 1922 massacre in what is now İzmir, even if some characters are just walking Wikipedia entries</p><p>This epic historical drama could have been called Once Upon a Time in Asia Minor or Once Upon a Time in Turkey, depending on which side of the Greek-Turkish divide you sit. That thorny geopolitical entanglement is what it attempts to unpick, sometimes too forcefully, in telling the story of the one-time melting pot of Smyrna (now İzmir). It culminates in a shockingly raw depiction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_Smyrna">1922 massacre and ethnic cleansing</a> of the Greek and Armenian population by Kemal Atatürk’s irregulars after they entered the city.</p><p>Filio Baltatzis (Mimi Denissi) is the matriarch of a Greek olive oil family in Smyrna, relaxed in their affluence in the Levantine port even as first world war storm clouds encroach. Greece is neutral but her husband Dimitris (Leonidas Kakouris) thinks it should join the Allies and unseat the Ottomans. His brother Spyros (Krateros Katsoulis) is more practical, not wanting to antagonise the ruling Turks. Dimitris should probably have paid more attention, as there are a fair few Turks among his servants, including Halil (Burak Hakkı), who has taken a shine to Ataturk – then a politically ambitious military figure.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/28/smyrna-review-greco-turkish-conflict">Continue reading...</a>

Five years after the start of the movement, She Said is the most overt of so-called “#MeToo movies” – films which depict revelations of sexual abuse, process the upheaval of powerful perpetrators, grapple with the consequences, or envision a path forward. The film, directed by Unorthodox’s Maria Schrader, is literally the story behind the story that kicked everything off, the Hollywood version of the mission to uncover what had been an open secret in Hollywood for years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/27/me-too-movement-movies-breaking-the-silence">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the BBC prepares to air her hard-hitting Reith Lecture, the celebrated author of Half of a Yellow Sun talks about truth, trans rights and our ‘misogyny-drenched’ planet. Plus: read an extract<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>I meet Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie the day after she delivers and records her Reith Lecture for the BBC. She is a commanding presence: flawless to look at, serene in her confidence, vivid and trenchant in her quest to smash every point and win every argument. We meet at Broadcasting House a few hours before she leaves London for Lagos: the writer now splits her time between Nigeria and the US. In the former, she says, “life is louder, more raucous, more joyful, my cousins are there. People come into the house all the time. In the US, I have silence and I need silence as well.” It’s a neat, fleeting snapshot of who she is, troublemaker and thinker, with enough self-awareness to make space for both.</p><p>The theme for the four Reith Lectures this year is freedom, and Ngozi Adichie’s contribution, which will launch the series this Wednesday on Radio 4, is on freedom of speech. The word was that it would be a cat-among-the-pigeons moment, making all the liberals in the incredibly curated audience clutch their pearls. The stated intention is, as you’d expect from Reith’s mission, to educate and entertain. But the subtext, I think, is to set a grenade off under some issue of the day.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/28/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-bbc-reith-lecture-freedom-truth-trans-rights">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Historian says Russia needs to lose its war in order to become a ‘normal’ European country – and stopping destruction of Ukraine’s power grid is essential</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/ukraine-live">Russia-Ukraine war: latest news updates</a></li></ul><p>When the Yale historian Timothy Snyder was asked by Ukraine’s government to fundraise for the war effort, he considered a project to restore Chernihiv library. It would have been an obvious choice for the bestselling author, who has visited the ruined library – a gracious gothic terracotta structure that survived two world wars but was smashed to rubble in March by Russia’s 500kg bombs.</p><p>Yet he soon decided that a fundraiser for a library would be “kind of morally self indulgent”. When he asked his friends in Kyiv what was most urgently needed, nobody hesitated: anti-drone defence. “I thought I should do the thing which is most urgent now,” Snyder told the Guardian in a phone interview from the Yale campus. “The ruins of the library are going to be there. I can raise money for that later. But right now, what’s happening is that the Russians are trying to freeze millions of people out by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/17/russia-launches-another-wave-of-missile-strikes-across-ukraine">destroying the power grid</a>.

<p>The death of two-year-old Awaab Ishak from exposure to mould has shown the consequences of uninhabitable homes. But how many people are living in similarly unhealthy conditions and what can be done to protect their health?</p><p>Toddler Awaab Ishak was said to be a happy, smiling little boy. And his parents say it is their home, where he should have been safe and cared for, that led to his death. The little boy fell ill after exposure to mould that blighted the family’s flat – and the coroner at his inquest said his tragic death must be a “defining moment” for the housing sector.</p><p>Yet grim though the conditions in the family’s flat were, they were not as uncommon as they should have been. Rob Booth, the Guardian’s social affairs correspondent, tells Nosheen Iqbal that mould is a widespread issue that, for some, can cause terrible health problems. One of them is Jane, whose lung condition may be terminal if she does not get a transplant – and has been caused, she says, by living in a home beset by mould. She is now taking legal action to try to protect others like her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/nov/28/how-dangerous-is-it-to-live-in-a-damp-mouldy-home-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

A combination of early marriage, child rearing and a focus on my own front yard were to blame for the delay. But I recovered from all three and started to focus on the horizon instead. Being well into my 50s, I knew my chances of ticking off all the usual tourist destinations were slim. And, for me, there was only one other horizon I absolutely had to see for myself. It belonged to a country with a cuisine, culture and history I knew better than that of my own: one whose language I had studied for nine years but had never spoken on its soil. In 2015 my long-distance love affair with France was finally consummated.</p><p>Liberated at last from – and with the encouragement of – my children, who clearly wanted me out of the country, I joined a house- and animal-minding website.
