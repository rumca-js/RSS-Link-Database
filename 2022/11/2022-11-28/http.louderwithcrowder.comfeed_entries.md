	I had every intention of going a day without Elon Musk content. But to quote western philosopher AEW's Excalibur, you GOT to give the people what they want. Plus if CNN found a way to bottle the lack of self-awareness in this tweet, they could have afforded to feed <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brian-stelter-potato-head-response" target="_blank">Brian "I'm Not a Potato, I'm a Man" Stelter</a> for another year.
</p><p>
	Elon Musk goes and buys Twitter. And both <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nancy-pelosi-daughter-whcd" target="_blank">the left and the media (but I repeat myself)</a> are in DEFCON eleventy meltdown mode over the fact there will be a social media app they no longer control the flow of information from. Elon Musk believes in free speech. Corporate media believes in free speech they agree with. The speech they don't agree with will literally kill democracy literally with its bare hands.
</p><p>
	So Elon posted a funny meme about it.
</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<a href="https://t.co/KZ7jeME3AX">pic.twitter.com/KZ7jeME3AX</a><br />
		— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1597170780130852864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2022</a>
</blockquote></div><p>
	It's understandable why people at CNN might be confused and think that was a real headline on the news-content site. It's not that far off from <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-cnn-control-rant" target="_blank">what CNN employees say out loud</a>. But it's a clear meme and a sloppy one at that.
</p><p>
	CNN didn't find it funny. They felt it necessary to not only fact-check the meme but be ginormous biyatches about it.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">This headline never appeared on CNN. Be better. <a href="https://t.co/n8xGp2Z6qm">pic.twitter.com/n8xGp2Z6qm</a><br />— CNN Communications (@CNNPR) <a href="https://twitter.com/CNNPR/status/1597241463523246081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Elon laughed in their face.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Lmaoooo<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1597274110455078912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>What I'd like to know is how many CNN journalismers does it take to fact-check a meme. If CNN runs itself like Twitter use to, I think ten. One person who knows how to use social media, and nine managers to micro-manage that person. I'm sure they called an all-hand meeting too, which we all know is the Taylor Lorenz of work meetings.</p><p>I was not able to go a day without Elon content. Tomorrow isn't looking good either.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The Twitter Files on free speech suppression soon to be published on Twitter itself. The public deserves to know what really happened …<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1597336812732575744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Drip. Drip. Drip. Bring on the chaos!</p><p><p>

It's been a major political topic at the World Cup, and the Iranian government is none too happy about it.

## OnlyFans declares filming sex content in a public school goes too far, bans teacher who did so

Now the (former) teacher lost her job AND her platform.</p><p>Samantha Peer, aka Khloe Karter, was a teacher at the Thunderbolt Middle School in Arizona. She also sold herself on OnlyFans, and after filming content IN HER CLASSROOM was fired. Turns out, middle schools aren't the only people who think that's a bad idea. Peer said on a TikTok video: "So, it seems OnlyFans deactivated both accounts (refunded all customers/subscribers) and is blocking me from making accounts."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="4e70d" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32217715&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>OnlyFans would <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/arizona-teacher-banned-onlyfans" target="_blank">not respond to Fox News</a>, but told them to read their policy that says the platform "prohibits users from uploading, posting, displaying, or publishing content on the platform that features sexual activities and was recorded or broadcasted from a public place."</p><p>So that makes two things you can't do on OnlyFans.

The communist Chinese government implemented one "SCHMOVID-zero" policy too many, and the people are revolting. As opposed to when they protested in <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/antifa-boston-mandate" target="_blank">America</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tyranny-police-pepper-spray-pre-teen-girls-they-weren-t-wearing-masks" target="_blank">Australia</a>, or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anti-mandate-protesters-tear-gas" target="_blank">Europe</a>, no one is telling these protesters they stink on ice.

And taking a lap around the internet, no one appears to be siding with the government against the Chinese citizens. Well, almost no one.

When those happened, anyone who spoke out against the government was called a grandma-killer and told that they were being selfish for wanting freedom. </p><p>It's not like what the Chinese government is telling their citizens sounds all that different from what our government was telling us. Back in April, the last time it popped off, China was telling people to "control their desire for freedom." Anthony Fauci <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anthony-fauci-drone" target="_blank">said the same thing to Americans on multiple occasions</a>. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The largest quarantine camp in China's Guangzhou city is being built.<br />It has 90,000 isolation pods. <a href="https://t.co/7VdAJpki5q">pic.twitter.com/7VdAJpki5q</a><br />— Songpinganq (@songpinganq) <a href="https://twitter.com/songpinganq/status/1596967307678318594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The same Anthony Fauci who is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anthony-fauci-shanghai" target="_blank">jealous of China's ability to lockdown their government</a>. You wonder if the people lighting their Fauci Prayer Candles as they tweet their support of the Chinese citizens miss the irony. Or how they are going to react now that the new American leftist buzzword has dropped: 'tridemic.'</p><p>There is going to be a new pandemic. There is going to be a new Fauci. We'll see how many people support lockdown protests when it's their own neighbors speaking up again.</p><p><p>

Kim Kardashian. who is in business with the company, was weak in responding to the ad featuring their collaboration with Adidas.</p><p>Point of information: This is the same <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ye-applepay-other-americans" target="_blank">Adidas who canceled Ye</a>, and the same Kim Kardashian who... <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/megyn-kelly-trashes-kardashians" target="_blank">you know</a>.</p><p>Kupp issued a strong statement blasting the company and called on others with sizable platforms to do the same: "To try to be a voice for our children, who rely on the protection of the men and women that were entrusted the responsibility of nurturing them and raising them up: please make yourself aware of the attack against our young ones by Balenciaga, and ensure that they are held responsible for it. For those of us in positions to create change in the way that companies manipulate people and advertise evil, please stand up!"</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://t.co/8Y4uGBZOoX">pic.twitter.com/8Y4uGBZOoX</a><br />— Cooper Kupp (@CooperKupp) <a href="https://twitter.com/CooperKupp/status/1596658448900333568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Kim Kardashian, who is in business with the company, needed a few days after the drama to reflect on how it made her feel. And while she shares our disgust, she has yet to determine whether she will stop working with the company.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">As a mother of four, I have been shaken by the disturbing images. The safety of children must be held with the highest regard and any attempts to normalize child abuse of any kind should have no place in our society — period.<br />— Kim Kardashian (@KimKardashian) <a href="https://twitter.com/KimKardashian/status/1597017104171298816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">As for my future with Balenciaga, I am currently re-evaluating my relationship with the brand, basing it off their willingness to accept accountability for something that should have never happened to begin with — & the actions I am expecting to see them take to protect children.<br />— Kim Kardashian (@KimKardashian) <a href="https://twitter.com/KimKardashian/status/1597029753172918272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Balenciaga is a high-end fashion company. If you want to remortgage your house, you can buy a pocketbook with the Adidas stripes on it. Or, you can be a celebrity/influencer and get one for free. Their advertisement featured little girls holding teddy bears in bondage gear.<br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">the brand "Balenciaga" just did a uh..... interesting... photoshoot for their new products recently which included a very purposely poorly hidden court document about 'virtual child porn'<br /><br />normal stuff <a href="https://t.co/zjMN5WhZ0s">pic.twitter.com/zjMN5WhZ0s</a><br />— shoe (@shoe0nhead) <a href="https://twitter.com/shoe0nhead/status/1594532715126202368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>As if the little girls holding bondage bears didn't drive home the message clear enough, on the desk next to the pocketbook <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/super-bowl-mvp-cooper-kupp-slams-balenciaga-controversial-ad-campaign?intcmp=tw_fnc" target="_blank">there was a copy of  United States v. Williams</a>. It's a Supreme Court case about distributing child pornography. The ad makers felt that, as part of an ad campaign featuring little girls with bondage bears, a copy of the ruling hidden in the clutter on the desk was the one thing needed to tie it all together.</p><p>While Twitter was quick to notice, everyone at Balenciaga missed that tiny detail. The company apologized and is suing the ad company responsible.</p><p>Unclear is if they also missed the photos of the little girls selling BDSM before those photos went up on the Balenciaga website. But Balenciaga is sorry about those too.</p><p><p>
