	I had every intention of going a day without Elon Musk content. But to quote western philosopher AEW's Excalibur, you GOT to give the people what they want. Plus if CNN found a way to bottle the lack of self-awareness in this tweet, they could have afforded to feed <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brian-stelter-potato-head-response" target="_blank">Brian "I'm Not a Potato, I'm a Man" Stelter</a> for another year.
</p><p>
	Elon Musk goes and buys Twitter. And both <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nancy-pelosi-daughter-whcd" target="_blank">the left and the media (but I repeat myself)</a> are in DEFCON eleventy meltdown mode over the fact there will be a social media app they no longer control the flow of information from. Elon Musk believes in free speech. Corporate media believes in free speech they agree with. The speech they don't agree with will literally kill democracy literally with its bare hands.
</p><p>
	So Elon posted a funny meme about it.
</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<a href="https://t.co/KZ7jeME3AX">pic.twitter.com/KZ7jeME3AX</a><br />
		‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1597170780130852864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2022</a>
</blockquote></div><p>
	It's understandable why people at CNN might be confused and think that was a real headline on the news-content site. It's not that far off from <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-cnn-control-rant" target="_blank">what CNN employees say out loud</a>. But it's a clear meme and a sloppy one at that.
</p><p>
	CNN didn't find it funny. They felt it necessary to not only fact-check the meme but be ginormous biyatches about it.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">This headline never appeared on CNN. Be better. <a href="https://t.co/n8xGp2Z6qm">pic.twitter.com/n8xGp2Z6qm</a><br />‚Äî CNN Communications (@CNNPR) <a href="https://twitter.com/CNNPR/status/1597241463523246081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Elon laughed in their face.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Lmaoooo<br />‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1597274110455078912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>What I'd like to know is how many CNN journalismers does it take to fact-check a meme. If CNN runs itself like Twitter use to, I think ten. One person who knows how to use social media, and nine managers to micro-manage that person. I'm sure they called an all-hand meeting too, which we all know is the Taylor Lorenz of work meetings.</p><p>I was not able to go a day without Elon content. Tomorrow isn't looking good either.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The Twitter Files on free speech suppression soon to be published on Twitter itself. The public deserves to know what really happened ‚Ä¶<br />‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1597336812732575744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Drip. Drip. Drip. Bring on the chaos!</p><p><p>

## Game On: Elon Musk just blasted Apple CEO Tim Cook, 'why do you hate free speech?'

In less than a month, Musk has <a href="https://youtu.be/qROpsszu5U0" target="_blank">exposed everything we assumed Twitter was doing internally to stifle opposing viewpoints</a>. He I, in theory, do the same to the radical left at large. Keep popping that popcorn.</p><p><p>

## OnlyFans declares filming sex content in a public school goes too far, bans teacher who did so

Now the (former) teacher lost her job AND her platform.</p><p>Samantha Peer, aka Khloe Karter, was a teacher at the Thunderbolt Middle School in Arizona. She also sold herself on OnlyFans, and after filming content IN HER CLASSROOM was fired. Turns out, middle schools aren't the only people who think that's a bad idea. Peer said on a TikTok video: "So, it seems OnlyFans deactivated both accounts (refunded all customers/subscribers) and is blocking me from making accounts."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>OnlyFans would <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/arizona-teacher-banned-onlyfans" target="_blank">not respond to Fox News</a>, but told them to read their policy that says the platform "prohibits users from uploading, posting, displaying, or publishing content on the platform that features sexual activities and was recorded or broadcasted from a public place."</p><p>So that makes two things you can't do on OnlyFans. You can't film in a public place.

The communist Chinese government implemented one "SCHMOVID-zero" policy too many, and the people are revolting. As opposed to when they protested in <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/antifa-boston-mandate" target="_blank">America</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tyranny-police-pepper-spray-pre-teen-girls-they-weren-t-wearing-masks" target="_blank">Australia</a>, or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anti-mandate-protesters-tear-gas" target="_blank">Europe</a>, no one is telling these protesters they stink on ice.

## Super Bowl MVP unloads on Balenciaga over kiddie-porn-themed ad (Kim Kardashian... not so much)

Kim Kardashian. who is in business with the company, was weak in responding to the ad featuring their collaboration with Adidas.</p><p>Point of information: This is the same <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ye-applepay-other-americans" target="_blank">Adidas who canceled Ye</a>, and the same Kim Kardashian who... <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/megyn-kelly-trashes-kardashians" target="_blank">you know</a>.</p><p>Kupp issued a strong statement blasting the company and called on others with sizable platforms to do the same: "To try to be a voice for our children, who rely on the protection of the men and women that were entrusted the responsibility of nurturing them and raising them up: please make yourself aware of the attack against our young ones by Balenciaga, and ensure that they are held responsible for it. For those of us in positions to create change in the way that companies manipulate people and advertise evil, please stand up!"</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://t.co/8Y4uGBZOoX">pic.twitter.com/8Y4uGBZOoX</a><br />‚Äî Cooper Kupp (@CooperKupp) <a href="https://twitter.com/CooperKupp/status/1596658448900333568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Kim Kardashian, who is in business with the company, needed a few days after the drama to reflect on how it made her feel.

If you want to remortgage your house, you can buy a pocketbook with the Adidas stripes on it. Or, you can be a celebrity/influencer and get one for free. Their advertisement featured little girls holding teddy bears in bondage gear.<br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">the brand "Balenciaga" just did a uh..... interesting... photoshoot for their new products recently which included a very purposely poorly hidden court document about 'virtual child porn'<br /><br />normal stuff <a href="https://t.co/zjMN5WhZ0s">pic.twitter.com/zjMN5WhZ0s</a><br />‚Äî shoe (@shoe0nhead) <a href="https://twitter.com/shoe0nhead/status/1594532715126202368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>As if the little girls holding bondage bears didn't drive home the message clear enough, on the desk next to the pocketbook <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/super-bowl-mvp-cooper-kupp-slams-balenciaga-controversial-ad-campaign?intcmp=tw_fnc" target="_blank">there was a copy of  United States v. Williams</a>. It's a Supreme Court case about distributing child pornography. The ad makers felt that, as part of an ad campaign featuring little girls with bondage bears, a copy of the ruling hidden in the clutter on the desk was the one thing needed to tie it all together.</p><p>While Twitter was quick to notice, everyone at Balenciaga missed that tiny detail. The company apologized and is suing the ad company responsible.</p><p>Unclear is if they also missed the photos of the little girls selling BDSM before those photos went up on the Balenciaga website. But Balenciaga is sorry about those too.</p><p><p>
