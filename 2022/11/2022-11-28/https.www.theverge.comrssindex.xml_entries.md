<p id="aXBQfJ">While the Ultra has a native Depth app, it’s not meant to be used as a dive computer. It’s more for activities like underwater pool swims and snorkeling. It mostly tells you the water temperature and time as well as current and maximum depth. Conversely, the Oceanic Plus app was designed by Huish Outdoors to be used as a wrist-worn dive computer for depths up to 40 meters (130 feet). Before dives, users can set their surface time, depth, and gas, which the app will then use to calculate a no-decompression time, which is how long a diver can stay at a given depth. Divers can...</p>

  <p id="r2ciWW">Fun fact from the files of “there’s a job for that”: there are <a href="https://exolithsimulants.com/">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.offplanetresearch.com/">companies</a> that specialize in making fake Moon dirt. Technically, it’s called lunar <em>regolith </em>to help differentiate it from “soil,” which implies the presence of organic material, or from “dirt,” which, for this story, I learned <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dirt">literally just means</a> “anything that makes you dirty.” Whatever you call it, it is <em>nothing</em> like our friendly terrestrial soils: it’s sharp, dusty, and jagged; it’s full of glassy globs from meteorite impacts; and its chemical composition has been altered by constant bombardment from solar wind. In short, lunar regolith is strange and alien stuff. </p>

<p id="hmvNXk">Of course, the first sound clip I searched for was the sound of an old 56K modem connecting to the internet, which is thankfully present and accounted for. “In the 90’s, computers would scream every time you went online.
