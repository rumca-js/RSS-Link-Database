Dickens rescued him from the stupor of adolescence by showing that books were an escape route for the mind; Prince, with his keening falsetto, the prestidigitation of his guitar-playing and his hyperkinetic dance moves, delivered a physical excitement that is music\u2019s special prerogative. Dickens made Hornby laugh, while Prince thrilled him by seeming to offer \u201chours of erotic ecstasy\u201d.</p><p>That said, the pair have not much in common, apart from their almost crazed productivity.

During the first half of the decade, poor farmers were encouraged to donate their blood in exchange for money. Due to a lack of health and safety standards, a staggering number of donors as well as those who received transfusions contracted HIV. In Ximei\u2019s province of Henan, more than 300,000 villagers live with the debilitating effects of the condition, all while facing societal discrimination and neglect.</p><p>In following Ximei\u2019s day-to-day routines, the film captures the gruelling reality of simply making your voice heard in an environment that is determined to strip HIV-positive people of their humanity. The lively thread that binds this stigmatised community together, Ximei makes endless trips to the central hospital where she demands better medical treatment on behalf of other HIV-positive people, many of whom are elderly and illiterate. In contrast to the indifference of government officials, the warm atmosphere of Ximei\u2019s home, a haven for those living with HIV, attests to the importance of community and grassroots organisation. Ximei herself was abandoned by her birth parents; later, when she was diagnosed with HIV at the age of 10 after a blood transfusion, it was her foster family that nurtured her sense of compassion.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/28/ximei-review-ai-weiwei-produced-inspiring-portrait-of-chinese-aids-activist\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/28/iranian-artists-call-for-boycott-of-cultural-institutions-with-links-to-regime", "title": "Iranian artists call for boycott of cultural institutions with links to regime", "date_published": "2022-11-28 08:41:51+00:00", "description": "<p>Art activism has increased in and outside the country since death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini</p><p>Dozens of Iranian artists have <a href=\"https://solidarityiran.wordpress.com/\">called for an international boycott</a> of cultural institutions run by or affiliated with the Islamic Republic in protest against the regime\u2019s worsening human rights abuses.</p><p>The call by artists, writers, film-makers and academics living in Iran and among its diaspora comes amid growing anti-government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/oct/03/something-sparked-iranian-women-art-protest-mahsa-amini\">art activism</a> by Iranians inside and outside the country after the death of 22-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/17/iran-protests-death-kurdish-woman-mahsaa-amini-morality-police\">Mahsa Amini</a>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/28/iranian-artists-call-for-boycott-of-cultural-institutions-with-links-to-regime\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/28/no-10-set-to-allow-new-onshore-wind-projects-in-england-in-u-turn", "title": "No 10 set to allow new onshore wind projects in England in U-turn", "date_published": "2022-11-28 08:38:35+00:00", "description": "<p>Grant Shapps says there will be more onshore wind projects \u2018where communities are in favour of it\u2019</p><p>Downing Street appears set to allow new onshore wind projects in England following years of an effective ban, Grant Shapps has indicated, with ministers giving way in the face of a growing backbench Conservative rebellion.</p><p>Shapps, the business and energy secretary, said there would be more onshore wind projects \u201cwhere communities are in favour of it\u201d, which would mean the end of a de facto block on such projects since 2014 under planning rules.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/28/no-10-set-to-allow-new-onshore-wind-projects-in-england-in-u-turn\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/nov/28/oil-stocks-slide-china-protests-markets-business-live", "title": "Oil and stocks slide as China protests hit markets \u2013 business live", "date_published": "2022-11-28 08:24:51+00:00", "description": "<p>Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/28/clashes-in-shanghai-as-protests-over-zero-covid-policy-grip-china\">Clashes in Shanghai as protests over zero-Covid policy grip China</a></li></ul><p><strong>Britain\u2019s blue-chip share index has fallen half a percent at the start of trading.</strong></p><p>The FTSE 100 index has shed 39 points to 7447 points, falling back from last week\u2019s two-month highs.</p><p>Rising COVID-19 infections remain a significant drag on growth.<br /></p><p>Support for the property sector looks sufficient to limit the damage but may not spur faster growth.<br /></p><p>A widening of infections could add to supply chain interruptions, with China\u2019s problems spilling into global markets.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/nov/28/oil-stocks-slide-china-protests-markets-business-live\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/28/new-york-jets-mike-white-zach-wilson-nfl-football", "title": "What\u2019s better than 2.8in per play on offense?
