<p>Fifa’s president told the world he feels Arab, African, gay and disabled, while the media are racist hypocrites. So how accurate was his World Cup monologue? </p><p><strong>Today I have very strong feelings. Today I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arab. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel a migrant worker. I feel like them because I know what it feels like to be discriminated, to be bullied as a foreigner in a country. At school I was bullied because I had red hair and freckles. I was bullied, plus I was Italian, so imagine. I didn’t speak good German. What do you do then? You lock yourself down in your room, you cry and then you try to make some friends. You try to engage … You don’t start accusing or fighting, you start engaging. This is what we should be doing.”</strong></p><p>Infantino’s opening remarks set the tone for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/19/fifa-gianni-infantino-world-cup-qatar">his unexpectedly lengthy address</a>. They are personalised and speak to his key theme, that of hypocrisy and that the way to effect change is not through confrontation but “engagement”. The metaphor, comparing being bullied for having red hair to the experience of migrant workers who remain exploited in Qatar to this day, appears flippant, but is likely sincere. Infantino has also lumped together the experience of exploited workers and those of LGBTQ+ people whose sexuality is illegal in Qatar, with those of some Qataris themselves – especially those at the top of society – who feel they have been the subject of unfair criticism. This gives the impression of a relativist approach to a highly sensitive debate.</p><p><strong>It’s not easy every day to read all these critics of decisions that were taken 10 years ago when none of us was there. Now everyone knows we have to make the best out of it and make the best World Cup ever. Doha is ready, Qatar is ready, it will be the best World Cup ever, of course.”</strong></p><p><strong>Let’s start with the migrant workers. We are told many many lessons from some Europeans, the western world. I am European. I actually am. I think for what we Europeans have been doing in the last 3,000 years, around the world, we should be apologising for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people.”</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/19/world-cup-gianni-infantino-speech-fact-check-qatar">Continue reading...</a>

<p>During the second world war, many artists fled to Marseille, where André Breton assembled a group of surrealists every Sunday to play creative games. Inspired by this, author Mike McInnes and artist <a href="http://www.mattkenyon.co.uk/portfolio">Matt Kenyon</a> imagined the surrealists as a football team, assigning positions and made-up quotes to figures including Max Ernst, Frida Kahlo and Albert Camus (who was actually a goalkeeper in Algeria in the late 1920s). The football cards appear in McInnes’s book <em><a href="https://www.meyer-meyer-sport.co.uk/producttags/man-the-footballer-homo-passiens/">Homo Passiens: Man the Footballer </a></em><a href="https://www.meyer-meyer-sport.co.uk/producttags/man-the-footballer-homo-passiens/">(Meyer &amp; Meyer Sport)</a>. “Surrealism and football are a very good match,” says McInnes. “There’s a certain type of brainwave among fans when they’re watching games – a kind of dream state.

<p>Beneath the billionaire’s blurry vision for Twitter lies the notion that it’s good to have a ‘marketplace of ideas’ </p><p>At the end of last month, just after Elon Musk had bought Twitter, I wrote <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/29/elon-musk-twitter-social-media-toxic-content">that having him responsible for an important part of the world’s public sphere</a> could turn out to be “like entrusting a delicate clock to a monkey”. This struck some readers, especially those with tech backgrounds, as intemperate, but everything that has happened since suggests that it was bang on the money.</p><p>The world has watched transfixed as the monkey flails around wondering what to do with his shiny new plaything. He can do whatever he likes with it, so we watch breathlessly to see what he tries next and speculate endlessly on whether this stunt or that one will do the trick. We are like spectators watching a chess grandmaster playing some practice games – trying this gambit or that; moving pieces on a board; tearing up the board and refashioning it as a sphere; and so on. The fact that the pieces on this chessboard are human beings – with mortgages, dependents, health insurance, etc – is nowhere mentioned, except by Maria Farrell in her <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2022/11/04/whither-twitter/">splendid, excoriating essay</a> on the takeover. She too has been through a narcissistic acquisition and knows what it’s like for real people.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/19/elon-musk-needs-to-learn-that-more-debate-does-not-mean-more-truth">Continue reading...</a>

## Emmet Cohen: Uptown in Orbit review – phenomenal technique anchored in the past

<p>(Mack Avenue)<br />The dazzling pianist and his fine band prove themselves masters of several styles on this album of classics and originals</p><p>The American pianist <a href="https://emmetcohen.com/">Emmet Cohen</a> has been described as a pivotal figure in today’s jazz, referring perhaps to his delightful openness in matters of style. Take the first of these 11 tracks, entitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfRu8Gm41xQ">Finger Buster</a>. It was composed and first performed by Willie “the Lion” Smith (1897-1973), one of the flamboyant school of Harlem stride pianists in the 1920s and 30s. We hear it first in the flat, gritty tones of an old gramophone record, until the sound suddenly switches to modern stereo perfection. I suspect that this is Cohen’s typically sidelong way of suggesting that jazz of any period becomes modern when you play it.</p><p>He certainly has phenomenal technique and a superb trio – completed by Russell Hall (bass) and Kyle Poole (drums) – able to do justice to any style. With unerring touch they visit pieces by Gerry Mulligan, Duke Ellington and others, minutely following the idiom of each while discreetly adding something of themselves. There are also originals by Cohen, my favourite being Spillin’ the Tea. It begins as a demure teatime serenade, becoming steadily livelier as the tea party gets out of hand and ending in satisfying chaos. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/19/emmet-cohen-uptown-in-orbit-review-phenomenal-technique-anchored-in-the-past">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Baked new potatoes with soured cream and rose harissa, curried egg mayo that’s brilliant crisp-dunking fodder, and rösti with lime pickle yoghurt, peas and mint</p><p>Beer food, they said, for when you’ve got people over to watch the World Cup and stuff … But what is beer food, beyond nuts, crisps and calling in a meat feast pizza with extra jalapeños? It’s what my friend Alejandro calls “nibblings” and <a href="http://www.bestwinesinthesupermarket.uk/about-us.aspx">my dad</a> “snackettes”. </p><p>A good nibbling is a well-seasoned, often potato-based thing. It is pick-up-able, dunkable and, sometimes, slatherable with something nice and punchy, allowing for kick-back against (my) horrible habits such as smoking out of the window and other such abominations. These recipes deliver all those things and are mostly doable well in advance. There is only a little work involved in getting them ready, the shopping is one fell swoop of a large, high-street retailer-type thing and, vitally, there is very little effort required when it comes to eating them. Which frees up time and, indeed, a hand for holding a beer or waving about in the air when someone scores, or doesn’t, or whatever it is.</p><p>Max Halley is owner of <a href="https://www.maxssandwichshop.com/">Max’s Sandwich Shop</a>, London N4, <a href="https://www.bestpubsintheworld.com/">The Five Bells</a> in Salisbury and The Sam Weller’s in Bath.

<p>While sport speaks to the best of the human spirit, officials too often degrade it, exploiting fans’ love and loyalty for their own gain </p><p>I must have been 10 when I went to a football match with my parents and realised that the game resonated far beyond the field of play. The game was at the Cooperage Stadium in Mumbai and we had gone to see East Bengal, a legendary Indian team, play in a cup competition. The team had been formed during the days of the Raj to represent the Hindus of East Bengal. This was where my father had grown up, amid much luxury, our family being part of the rich Hindu minority that dominated East Bengal, where most of the population was Muslim.</p><p>All of this was lost in 1947 as a result of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/06/75-years-india-partition-britain-generations-india-pakistan">partition of India</a>, when East Bengal became East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, and millions of Hindus left. My father, who had made Mumbai his home, knew he could never go back. Watching the East Bengal team that Sunday afternoon was his way of connecting with the land he always regarded as home and whose loss he mourned. As East Bengal won, my father’s spirits lifted.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/19/world-cup-qatar-watch-game-sport-officials">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>O2 Arena, London</strong><br />Florence Welch commands communal release of energy that holds together set heavy with ideas</p><p>A man is on his hands and knees, scrubbing Florence Welch’s blood from a previously pristine white plinth. “No broken bones, they don’t think,” she says upon returning to the stage, her right foot bandaged after a conflab with a medic. She immediately launches into Choreomania, a song about a medieval phenomenon in which groups of people would be taken by the compulsion to dance themselves to the brink of death and beyond. It was, perhaps, always going to go this far.</p><p>Florence + the Machine’s recent album, Dance Fever, posited that movement is a necessity, as a tool for communication and as a release valve. Its songs were fuelled by Welch’s grief at losing the ability to tour during the pandemic, giving them an almost metatextual edge that she eagerly exploits here. By the time she has ripped through a couple of Choreomania’s verses she has run, still barefoot, from the front of the arena to the back and hoisted herself atop a barrier. There, arms spread wide, she roars: “You said that rock’n’roll is dead, but is that just because it has not been resurrected in your image?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/19/florence-the-machine-review-athletic-feats-and-eerie-rocknroll-o2-arena-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Keen to explore an artist’s oeuvre but overwhelmed by choice in today’s stream-heavy world? Fear not: from Joni to Fela, Madonna to Miles, our critics tell you where to start</p><p>We exist in a once unimaginable world of musical abundance. The internet means that more or less the entirety of pop history is available to anyone at the touch of a button; more than 100,000 new tracks are uploaded to just one streaming service every day. Complete obscurity has been essentially eradicated: even if a song is too arcane for Spotify or Apple Music or Tidal, it is more than likely someone will have uploaded it to YouTube. Indeed, music is so abundant, the sheer volume on offer can feel overwhelming – where do you start?</p><p>The obvious answer is a greatest hits record or a best-of playlist, but there is something more fulfilling about taking in a complete statement from an artist, even – or perhaps more so – in an era when the album increasingly seems like a devalued currency, just a collection from which you can cherrypick tracks for a playlist. Picking the ideal introduction to an artist is sometimes very straightforward – their best-known album may be their best-known album for a reason – and sometimes more serpentine: not every artist’s biggest album shows the full breadth of what they do. But here are 15 potential embarkation points for some of the most important artists of the pop era. <em>Alexis Petridis</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/19/best-albums-by-biggest-artists-bowie-beyonce-bts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Spanish photographer’s shot of an Iranian woman in a hijab has recently acquired new resonance</p><p>Despite not being a religious person, José Luis Barcia Fernández has long been fascinated by the rituals, rules and uniforms of faith. After photographing the hooded <em>capirotes</em> of Seville’s Holy Week, and Jews, Muslims and Christians in Jerusalem, the Spanish photographer travelled to Iran four years ago, where he took this shot of a woman in a hijab silhouetted against a tree and a sky filled with birds. He already had the shot he wanted in mind when he came across the woman, who was standing by a stunning mosque in the Tajrish neighbourhood of Tehran.</p><p>“There were lots of birds and a beautiful tree,” he says. “I saw this woman and got the shot, which seems to show her headscarf, with its floral motif, continuing up into the tree.

They don’t need anything. Deep down to them we are a sort of elegant Third World.” The history of American sport reads as one iteration of this blazing autonomy: from the development of baseball as a derivative of regional English games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoolball">stoolball</a> and <a href="https://protoball.org/Tut-Ball">tut-ball</a> to the evolution of rugby union into American football and the creation of basketball from the manipulation of a soccer ball indoors, the US has specialized in fashioning its own kind of sporting modernity out of Europe’s raw cultural materials, often consigning these older sports to the scrapheap of national memory.</p><p>But globalization – the great success story of American free-market economics – and the unstoppable rise of football have, in recent decades, forced the US to confront a discomfiting reality: in the world’s most popular sport, the global hegemon remains a middleweight at best. The country that has everything now finds that it doesn’t: emerging (almost) every four years from a middling confederation into the glare of the World Cup, the spotlight deflected for once towards other countries, the America that wants for nothing – so confident, so culturally self-reliant – now finds itself in need. It needs to prove that it has footballing muscle equal to its muscle in every other domain. It needs to show that it belongs. And it needs, perhaps more than anything, to convince the world that it can produce a player in the men’s game equal to Haaland, Neymar, Salah, or Mbappé.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/19/christian-pulisic-usmnt-world-cup-2022-qatar-soccer">Continue reading...</a>

But instead of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/kirstie-allsopp-cancelling-netflix-will-not-buy-a-house-in-any-location" title="">giving up Netflix so she could save for a deposit</a>, as Kirstie Allsopp notoriously recommended, she sold the streaming service the rights to her gay romance comic book series.</p><p>The series in question is of course Heartstopper, the web comic turned graphic novel turned Netflix show that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/22/heartstopper-review-alice-oseman-netflix-tv-drama" title="">this paper’s reviewer</a> described as “completely lovely” when it aired earlier this year. The boy-meets-boy tale, set in a British secondary school, sees rugby captain Nick and socially awkward Charlie navigate friendships, bullying, coming out – and falling in love. It’s not hard to see why the TV adaptation won over teenagers and adults alike, with its lovable characters, quirky nods to its comic book origins – for example, tiny animations of hand-drawn flowers form a circle round the actors when Nick and Charlie share their first kiss – and an injection of starriness in the shape of Olivia Colman (Nick’s mum) and Stephen Fry (headmaster Barnes). The show’s success resulted in a huge increase in book sales for Oseman: the Heartstopper series has now sold more than 6m copies worldwide. Volume One recently won the Books Are My Bag readers’ choice award and is a contender for the 2022 Waterstones book of the year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/19/alice-oseman-author-heartstopper-sex-romance-asexuality">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Our daily rundown will be available through the tournament. Here is a taster to set the scene as the big kick-off looms</p><p>The first World Cup in Asia was one for outsiders with both South Korea and Turkey just one game away from the 2002 final. An early start in late May, one that avoided the July rains but also gave star players little time to rest after tough European seasons, was given as a reason for the struggles of some traditional powers. History could repeat itself as the second World Cup in Asia has also been moved due to climatic reasons, albeit quite a bit back rather than a little forward, and while the mid-season action means that the biggest names won’t have played so many games, they will have almost no time to prepare.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/19/world-cup-2022-briefing-the-value-of-preparation-time-in-qatar">Continue reading...</a>

When the data hits, a robot draws toenail lines for the VAR; the VAR checks them, tells the referee and sends a 3D model to broadcasters. Fifa says it will cut the average 70-second wait before a goal can be celebrated down to “just 25 seconds” – and anyone who says it’s sucking the life out of football is wrong: “We are very proud of this work.” Also new this winter: a chance to see more than half a starting XI subbed off in a game – five subs in normal time and another in extra time – while benches will expand to 15 players, up from 12.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/19/from-robot-vars-to-air-cooling-nine-things-to-look-out-for-at-qatar-2022">Continue reading...</a>

What many would film as a soap opera is instead treated by tough-minded sensualist Denis as a study in emotional violence, fearlessly acted by the principals.

Coming down the tracks are seven more cases. She is currently on bail but, given the high number of extrajudicial killings that have been the hallmark of ex-president Rodrigo Duterte’s ignominious rule, she has been forced to wear a bulletproof vest when on the road. Standing up to a dictator has a heavy price.</p><p>What flows through this, Ressa’s memoir, is a strong ethical sense that journalism has to be grounded in honesty and truth-telling, in evidence and incontrovertible facts. An experienced and acclaimed journalist, Ressa made her career at CNN, setting up and running the Southeast Asia Bureau during the 1990s. Born in the Philippines then raised and educated in the US, she had returned after graduation and found her way into the media at an exciting time – colonialism had ended and democracy seemed possible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/19/how-to-stand-up-to-a-dictator-by-maria-ressa-review-facing-down-despots">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kyiv could face ‘complete shutdown’ of power amid crippled Ukrainian grid; hundreds of Ukrainians disappeared in Kherson, say war crime researchers  </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">See all our Ukraine coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>Russian missile strikes have crippled almost half of Ukraine’s energy system</strong>, the government in Kyiv has said, as authorities warned that the city could face a “complete shutdown” of the power grid as winter sets in.</p><p>With temperatures falling and Kyiv seeing its first snow, officials were working to restore power nationwide after some of the <strong>heaviest bombardment of Ukrainian civilian infrastructure in the war</strong>. The UN says Ukraine’s electricity and water shortages threaten a humanitarian disaster.</p><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy has dismissed the idea of a “short truce” with Russia,</strong> saying it would only make things worse. “Russia is now looking for a short truce, a respite to regain strength,” the Ukrainian president said in remarks broadcast at the Halifax International Security Forum. “Someone may call this the war’s end, but such a respite will only worsen the situation.”</p><p><strong>Hundreds of Ukrainians were detained and abducted in Kherson</strong> after Russia seized the province, in evidence of a planned campaign, a Yale University group researching war crimes has said. The Conflict Observatory said it had documented 226 extrajudicial detentions and forced disappearances in Kherson. About a quarter of that number were allegedly subjected to torture and four died in custody.</p><p><strong>The Kremlin has accused Ukrainian soldiers of executing more than 10 Russian prisoners of war</strong> following the circulation of a video on social media purporting to be from the frontline. The footage appears to show Russian soldiers emerging from an outbuilding in the grounds of a house with their hands above their heads before they are told to lie face down. One of the men, as he emerges from the building, appears to turn his gun on Ukrainian soldiers. The footage suggests all the Russians were killed in the violence that followed.</p><p>Turkey’s president, <strong>Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, talked with Volodymyr Zelenskiy and they congratulated each other for the extension of a UN-brokered grains deal</strong>, Erdoğan’s office said. Erdoğan told Zelenskiy the “extension of this understanding to the negotiation table” would benefit all parties.</p><p><strong>The Dutch government will summon the Russian ambassador in the Netherlands over Russia’s response to the verdict in the trial over the 2014 shooting down of passenger flight MH17</strong>, news agency ANP reported, citing the foreign minister, Wopke Hoekstra.<strong> </strong>Russia has criticised the Dutch court’s decision to convict two former Russian intelligence agents and a Ukrainian separatist leader.</p><p><strong>Ukrainian experts were working at the site in the border area of south-eastern Poland where a missile killed two people</strong>, said Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba.<strong> </strong>He wrote on Twitter that Ukraine would continue “open and constructive” cooperation with Poland over the incident.</p><p><strong>Poland will not grant a Russian delegation visas to attend an Organisation for Security and cooperation in Europe (OSCE) meeting</strong> in Lodz on 1 and 2 December. “We are not giving them visas,” said Lukasz Jasina from the Polish foreign ministry.</p><p><strong>Vladimir Putin discussed creating a Turkish “gas hub” with Erdoğan</strong>, the Kremlin said on Friday.<strong> </strong>“Particular attention is paid to the prospects of implementing the initiative, launched by the Russian president in October and supported by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.”</p><p>Ministers of <strong>the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group said some members condemned the war in Ukraine and also pledged to keep supply chains and markets open. </strong>“There were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions,” their joint statement read, adding that Apec was not the forum to resolve security issues.</p><p><strong>Kyrylo Tymoshenko</strong>, deputy head of the Ukraine president’s office, <strong>has said two more bodies have been recovered in</strong> <strong>Vilniansk</strong> in the Zaporizhzhia region. “Thus nine people have already been found dead from the rockets of Russian terrorists who fired at residential buildings yesterday,” he said on Telegram. The claims have not been independently verified.</p><p>The UK Ministry of Defence said <strong>Russia appeared to be preparing defences for further major Ukrainian breakthroughs</strong> in Donetsk province.</p><p><strong>Construction of a planned barbed-wired fence along Finland’s long border with Russia will start early next year</strong>, Finnish border guard officials said, amid concerns over Europe’s changing security environment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/19/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-269-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
