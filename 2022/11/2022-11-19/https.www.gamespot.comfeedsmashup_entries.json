You want to be the very best, like no one ever was, so you set out on a cross-country journey to catch and train adorable monsters and rise to the ranks of Pokemon Master. It's a tale as old as time, or at least as old as 1996, and Pokemon games rarely venture outside this comfortable template. That made it all the more surprising when Pokemon Scarlet made me actually care and look forward to two of its three main story paths.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Spoilers follow.</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you've been following Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, you know that the game consists of three main story paths that you can take in any order. Victory Road is the traditional quest to become a Pokemon master while doing battle with your friendly rival, Nemona. Starfall Street is also a take on the classic Pokemon formula, as you invade and topple the bases of this game's ostensible antagonists, Team Star. And the Path of Legends has you venturing into the wild to battle against massive Titan Pokemon.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-pokemon-scarlets-titan-and-starfall-quests-got-me-right-in-the-feelings/1100-6509307/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/25-pokemon-that-frankly-look-delicious/2900-4460/", "title": "25 Pokemon That, Frankly, Look Delicious", "date_published": "2022-11-19 17:00:00+00:00", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4062629-_0010_pikachu.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Since the dawn of time (1997) humanity has looked to its video game consoles and has pondered about the possibility of eating a Pokemon. With hundreds of the little pocket monsters around after several decades of mainstream dominance, it's time to finally and seriously look at which Pokemon we'd catch, cook, and serve with some fava beans and a nice chianti.</p><p>We've looked at hundreds of Pokemon, runing the data through both the Gourmand 5000 and Culinator Model Max to find the most mouthwatering Pokemon out there. Don't blame us if your childhood is ruined.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Squirtle</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4062626-_0004_squirtle.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Why it looks delicious:</strong></p><p>There's got to be a reason why Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle villain Shredder kept on raving about turtle soup, and that thought has been carved into my minds since childhood. Don't blame me; blame television for a desire to devour adorable monsters.</p><p><strong>What we'd make:</strong></p><p>Squirtle soup, with a dash of Paras mushrooms.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Pikachu</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4062825-pika.png\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Why it looks delicious:</strong></p><p>Nothing tastes better than a company mascot, seasoned with the outrage of multiple generations of Pokemon fans before you dig in.</p><p><strong>What we'd make:</strong></p><p>You've heard of Pikachu, well get ready for Pikastew.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Oddish</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4062624-_0011_oddish.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Why it looks delicious:</strong></p><p>On the advice of my doctor who has begged me to stop taking nutritional advice from Joe Rogan, I've begun looking at healthier ingredients to add to my meals and have decided that frying up a sentient onion is probably a good idea.</p><p><strong>What we'd make:</strong></p><p>Are Oddish onion rings horrifying? Maybe, but at least they add some super-effective flavor to a Tauros burger.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dodrio</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4062623-_0020_dodrio.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Why it looks delicious:</strong></p><p>Dodrio's potential deliciousness lies not in its scrawny legs, but rather in the beefy necks attached to its meaty torso.</p><p><strong>What we'd make:</strong></p><p>The world is your Cloyster, as between the delicious serving of necks and a protein-loaded torso, you'll be dining for days on Dodrio delicacies.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Kingler</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4062622-_0015_kingler.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Why it looks delicious:</strong></p><p>Krabby, the chicken of the sea! While that little fella would undoubtedly make for a good meal, we're thinking bigger here. Specifically, its evolved form Kingler that has a gigantic crabhammer of a claw. There's some good meat to be had in that limb, so make certain you use a Masterchef ball to catch it.</p><p><strong>What we'd make:</strong></p><p>Stop, crabhammer time. Lop that mighty limb off, steam them until ready, and serve with a really <em>really </em>big bowl of butter.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Moltres</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4062621-_0013_moltres.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Why it looks delicious:</strong></p><p>The most mouth-watering aspect of Moltres is that this is a Pokemon that's already been cooked to perfection. Flame-grilled, this legendary bird is bound to be a meal to savor as it's a one-of-a-kind species.</p><p><strong>What we'd make:</strong></p><p>With all the hard work done, all you really need is a vat of batter to dip the remains of Moltres into until its crispier than a Kentucky chicken staple.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Togepi</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4062620-_0002_togepi.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Why it looks delicious:</strong></p><p>It's an egg. A cute egg that makes adorable sounds, but still an egg. Eggs are great.</p><p><strong>What we'd make:</strong></p><p>One of the best quick meals you can have is an egg on toast with a generous dash of habanero Tabasco sauce. Crack open a few Togepi, fry 'em up, and use a lid to make certain that they're evenly poached for a cute treat that's hard to beat.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Octillery</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4062619-_0012_octillery.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Why it looks delicious:</strong></p><p>Between jet-propelled sharks and elegant Goldeen in the oceans of Pokemon, there's no shortage of sea life to savor from those waters. You can't go wrong with Calamari, though, and with Octillery being one of the few non-poisonous cephalopods around, you'll be able to serve up entire platters of oceanic goodness.</p><p><strong>What we'd make:</strong></p><p>Calamari, Spanish-style. And with Octillery being a big Pokemon, you'll be able to feed plenty of people with this multi-limbed ink-squirter.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Stantler</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4062618-_0003_stantler.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Why it looks delicious:</strong></p><p>It's the least dangerous deer in the Pokedex, judging by how many hunters have gone missing while searching for fresh Sawsbuck game.</p><p><strong>What we'd make:</strong></p><p>Venison Stantleroff, seasoned with fresh Hoppip leaves and a few Morellul mushrooms to add a trippy kick to the meal.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Combusken</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4062617-_0021_combusken.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Why it looks delicious:</strong></p><p>Kentucky Fried Combusken. 'Nuff said.</p><p><strong>What we'd make:</strong></p><p>This humble starter can be used for a variety of meals. Enjoy it with a side of Torchic nuggets, dip it in some fresh Slugma sauce for some extra firepower, and finish it off with a Vanillish milkshake.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Wailord</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4062616-_0000_wailord.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Why it looks delicious:</strong></p><p>Some people call harvesting the gentle giant of the deep a crime against nature, but I call Wailord a floating buffet that can end world hunger.</p><p><strong>What we'd make:</strong></p><p>The biggest damn surf 'n turf meal you've ever laid eyes on.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Spoink</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4062615-_0005_spoink.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Why it looks delicious:</strong></p><p>The world had an obsession with bacon a couple of years ago, and it's time to revive that hunger by looking at the nutritional value of a porky Pokemon that has to constantly bounce to stop itself from having a literal heart attack.</p><p><strong>What we'd make:</strong></p><p>Some streaky Spoink bacon to go with those hard-boiled Togepi eggs would be brilliant.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Cherubi</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4062614-_0022_cherubi.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Why it looks delicious:</strong></p><p>Cherries! They're good for you, and provided that you can ignore the screaming Cherubi looking to hit you with a razer leaf attack, you'll find that they're one of the best natural sweet treats around.</p><p><strong>What we'd make:</strong></p><p>Perfect to enhance a bowl of granola or a classy way to cap off a night by popping them into a cocktail, Cherubi are great enhancers for meals and drinks... if you can ignore the screaming, that is.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Arceus</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4062613-_0024_arceus.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Why it looks delicious:</strong></p><p>I just want to find out what it means when TV chefs talk about food that tastes divine.</p><p><strong>What we'd make:</strong></p><p>God-tier food.
