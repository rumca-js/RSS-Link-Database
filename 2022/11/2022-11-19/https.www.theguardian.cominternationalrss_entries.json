Take the first of these 11 tracks, entitled <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfRu8Gm41xQ\">Finger Buster</a>. It was composed and first performed by Willie \u201cthe Lion\u201d Smith (1897-1973), one of the flamboyant school of Harlem stride pianists in the 1920s and 30s. We hear it first in the flat, gritty tones of an old gramophone record, until the sound suddenly switches to modern stereo perfection. I suspect that this is Cohen\u2019s typically sidelong way of suggesting that jazz of any period becomes modern when you play it.</p><p>He certainly has phenomenal technique and a superb trio \u2013 completed by Russell Hall (bass) and Kyle Poole (drums) \u2013 able to do justice to any style. With unerring touch they visit pieces by Gerry Mulligan, Duke Ellington and others, minutely following the idiom of each while discreetly adding something of themselves. There are also originals by Cohen, my favourite being Spillin\u2019 the Tea. It begins as a demure teatime serenade, becoming steadily livelier as the tea party gets out of hand and ending in satisfying chaos. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/19/emmet-cohen-uptown-in-orbit-review-phenomenal-technique-anchored-in-the-past\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/19/i-too-quit-twitter-last-never-been-more-relieved", "title": "I too quit Twitter this week \u2013 and have never been more relieved | Bidisha Mamata", "date_published": "2022-11-19 16:00:01+00:00", "description": "Elon Musk\u2019s latest acquisition once turned an innocuous trip to the cinema into something more disturbing<p>Last month, Elon Musk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/31/twitter-layoffs-elon-musk-takeover\" title=\"\">walked into Twitter</a> and then all the good people left.
