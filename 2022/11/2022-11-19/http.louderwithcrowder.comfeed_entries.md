But unlike most drama queens who proclaim they are leaving Twitter on Twitter, CBS News announced it on CBS News. So a lot fewer people know.</p><p>Here's journalismer Jonathan Vigliotti with the call.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">CBS News and its owned and operated stations are “pausing” activity on Twitter; blaming “uncertainty” on the platform. <a href="https://t.co/Pv1gEQjQJH">pic.twitter.com/Pv1gEQjQJH</a><br />— Jim Lokay (@LokayFOX5) <a href="https://twitter.com/LokayFOX5/status/1593828049321361410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>In light of the uncertainty around Twitter, and out of an abundance of caution, CBS News is pausing its activity on the social media site, as it continues to monitor the platform.</blockquote>

<p>I'm curious about the CBS News executive who made the decision to leave Twitter, what they thought the response would be. Did they think we were going to miss their news reports <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cbs-news-encourages-people-to-snitch-on-the-ice-cream-man-for-not-social-distancing" target="_blank">encouraging people to snitch on the ice cream man</a>? Or the way they <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ted-cruz-60-minutes-australia" target="_blank">cover up shamelessly for Joe Biden</a>? Or their <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cbs-deletes-fact-check-on-donald-trump-because-it-proved-trump-was-right" target="_blank">fact checks that need to be fact-checked</a>?</p><p>Let's say, for sake of argument, the internal chaos at the bird app is as advertised. And that the fired leftist employees telling liberal news outlets what they want to hear about Elon Musk are 100% truthy. Whether or not a CBS News digital media "professional" uploads a video in a tweet makes zero difference.<br /></p><p>What also makes zero difference is if this is a corporate CBS News decision for CBS News accounts only. And CBS News reporters are free to tweet whatever they want. Especially if they tweet the CBS News content that CBS News is virtue signaling about not posting themselves. </p><p>For the time being, no CBS News clips on Twitter. Maybe other networks will follow, maybe they won't.  It's not the act of defiance these chuckleheads think it is.</p><p><p>

## 'Your t***y is out': The Waffle House remains undefeated as unruly woman is removed upside-down and shoeless

I have to ask. Is there a beatdown more entertaining than a Waffle House beatdown? It's a regional thing because we never see this action in northeast diners. When things get heated, it rarely goes further than chest-thumping, tough talk, and daring the other person to go first.</p><p>Down south at The Waffle House it's on-sight. One poor upside-down girl learned this the hard way.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@queenofthethots69/video/7160336909322013998" class="tiktok-embed"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@queenofthethots69?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="@queenofthethots69">@queenofthethots69</a> moral of the story: don’t mess with waffle house employees <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/orlando?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="orlando">#orlando</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/florida?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="florida">#florida</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/orlandoflorida?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="orlandoflorida">#orlandoflorida</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/downtownorlando?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="downtownorlando">#downtownorlando</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/wafflehouse?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="wafflehouse">#wafflehouse</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/canipleasegetawaffle?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="canipleasegetawaffle">#canipleasegetawaffle</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7160336901608721194?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Julianna">♬ original sound - Julianna</a> </section> </blockquote> </div><p><em>"Your t*tty is out."</em></p><p><em>"Bye bye white girl."</em></p><p>The video, with over five million plays, was uploaded by the Queen of the Thots 69.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Queen Thot LXIX returned to TikTok to provide context to her previous video. You can't leave us with just a woman being removed from The Waffle House upside and without shoes and not give us backstory.</p><p>Queen Thot LXIX, in magnanimous fashion, obliged. It was a late night at the Waffle House, obvi. They were understaffed since we're still in Joe Biden's economy. One woman got pissed that she was waiting too long and left. Her friend decided to get up, get in The Waffle House employee's face, and threatened to beat her ass.</p><p>Like, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/waffle-house-tampa-viral" target="_blank">have you never been to a Waffle House before</a>? Do you even know how to Waffle House?</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@queenofthethots69/video/7164063108783361326" class="tiktok-embed"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@queenofthethots69?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="@queenofthethots69">@queenofthethots69</a> Replying to @jugbandjubilee <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7164063107814378286?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Julianna">♬ original sound - Julianna</a> </section> </blockquote> </div><blockquote>The Waffle House employee flew around that counter and served homegirl breakfast, lunch, and dinner. You mad you didn't get your food, girlie? Well, now you got fed something else. A knuckle sandwich. [The Waffle House employee] beat her so bad, she left her with a golf ball-sized knot on her forehead. Do you know how hard you have to hit someone on the hardest part of their head to leave a knot that big? Fast, too. That sh*t was there in two seconds.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>This is where we see the girl being carried out, upside down, and without her shoes.</p><p>What's upsetting is that the girl came back in to get her shoes and her purse, and started to pick a fight with Queen Thot 69. The upsetting part is that while the Queen and her court allegedly stomped a mudhole in upside down girl and walked it dry, they were too busy doing so to record the beatdown. Maybe someone else did. There is always<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/fast-food-beat-down" target="_blank"> a good samaritan who remembers to do it for the content</a>.</p><p>So what have we learned here? We learned that Waffle House employees are not to be trifled with. We learned you should always have your smartphone out and ready to record in case of late-night shenanigans. And while not confirmed to have played a part, we've learned that some people need to do a better job at holding their liquor.</p><p><p>

## Elon Musk asks if a certain former president should be brought back to Twitter and the results are overwhelming

At first, he was supposed to form a blue ribbon committee to determine what accounts to bring back. But with all the people he has been firing, he may have fired the person who was putting the committee together. On Friday, Elon started to take matters into his own hands.</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/babylon-bee-reinstated" target="_blank">The Babylon Bee</a> is back. Jordan Peterson is back. Andrew Tate is back. And at the time, a decision wasn't made about former President Donald Trump. So Elon posted a poll.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Reinstate former President Trump<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1593767953706921985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>As of 8:00 in the morning on Saturday, it was approaching TEN MILLION VOTERS. Overwhelmingly, Twitter users say to bring back Trump.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>Of course, not everyone is on board with the idea.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Idk man, last time he was here this platform was used to incite an insurrection, multiple people died, the Vice President of the United States was nearly assassinated, and hundreds were injured but I guess that’s not enough for you to answer the question. Twitter poll it is <a href="https://t.co/TVEkEH7faR">https://t.co/TVEkEH7faR</a><br />— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1593790066987442176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>But let's be honest with ourselves about these two.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">At this point they should just have sex and get it over with. <a href="https://t.co/79PF15vcyF">pic.twitter.com/79PF15vcyF</a><br />— Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1593585538552180738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Poll or no, Trump should just be brought back. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-skeptical-conservatives" target="_blank">And there are red flags conservatives should pay attention to about how serious Elon is about free speech</a>.</p><p>I understand the reason for the poll. Elon wants the engagement and is all about that sweet, sweet content. We here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website are all about doing it for the content. But ten million responses are overwhelming. Critics will say the poll isn't scientific. Critics of those critics will ask how sciency their polls were during the midterms.</p><p>Trump is running for president. 52% say it's time. And all the Twitter employees who would be tasked to find mail-in votes have quit. </p><p>It's time, Elon. It's time.</p><p><p>
