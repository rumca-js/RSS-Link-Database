<p>The days of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-12-30-did-it-seem-like-a-long-year.html"><ins>leap second</ins></a> creating headaches for software engineers are coming to an end. On Friday, government representatives at the General Conference on Weights and Measures in Paris, France voted nearly unanimously to retire the practice of occasionally adding one second to official clocks (via <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/19/science/time-leap-second-bipm.html"><em><ins>The New York Times</ins></em></a>).</p><p>Introduced in 1972 as a way to adjust Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to reconcile discrepancies that can come up between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second"><ins>atomic time and observed solar time</ins></a>, the leap second has been the bane of tech companies for decades. <a href="https://twitter.com/redditstatus/status/219244389044731904?s=20&amp;t=ja7k8FQeWgKxfwcVIOSpYw"><ins>In 2012</ins></a>, for instance, Reddit was down for about 40 minutes when the addition of a leap second that year confused the company’s servers. More recently, Cloudflare saw part of its <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-and-why-the-leap-second-affected-cloudflare-dns/"><ins>DNS services affected</ins></a> due to a time change in 2016.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Companies like Facebook parent Meta employ a technique called “smearing” to avoid outages whenever the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service adjusts UTC to add a leap second. Earlier this year, the social media giant published a blog post calling for an <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/07/25/production-engineering/its-time-to-leave-the-leap-second-in-the-past/"><ins>end to the practice</ins></a>. “Every leap second is a major source of pain for people who manage hardware infrastructures,” Meta said at the time. Part of the push to eliminate the leap second has come as a way to preserve UTC as the world’s official international time.</p><p>With this week’s vote, dignitaries from the US, Canada and France called for the practice to end before 2035. Russia voted against the proposal. In the past, the country has sought to delay the demise of the leap second because GLONASS, its global positioning system, incorporates the adjustment – the Global Position System (GPS) operated by the US does not. Felicitas Arias, the former director of the Time Department at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6c965be-a8ea-473d-89f4-9754f2675a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nature+Research&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNmM5NjViZS1hOGVhLTQ3M2QtODlmNC05NzU0ZjI2NzVhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0dXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9kNDE1ODYtMDIyLTAzNzgzLTUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImIyNjQzNmMxLTRkNzAtNDYyNy04ZGU4LWUzNzk3M2ZiNTY5NCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYb8RUtjxu3-4PdVQox06cKWQbpo1rLeOTmezitW-HZ0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-022-03783-5"><ins>told </ins><em><ins>Nature</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>the decision may force Russia to launch new satellites.</p><p>There’s still another organization that needs to weigh in on the matter before software engineers can breathe a sigh of relief. The International Telecommunications Union, the group responsible for transmitting universal time, will vote on the issue next year. If it moves forward with “Resolution D,” metrologists and astronomers will have until at least 2135 to figure out how to reconcile the atomic and astronomical time scales.</p>

## NASA's Orion spacecraft on track to begin Moon flyby on November 21st

<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lockeed-martin-completes-orion-moon-spacecraft-160638296.html">Orion crew vehicle</a> is exceeding expectations on its way to the Moon. NASA provided an <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/">update</a> on Artemis 1 following the mission’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-artemis-1-mission-successful-launch-084330480.html">successful launch early Wednesday morning</a>. "Orion has been performing great so far," Vehicle Integration Manager Jim Geffre said during a press briefing NASA held on Friday. “All of the systems are exceeding expectations from a performance standpoint.”</p><p>Artemis 1 seeks to confirm the crew vehicle can safely carry human astronauts to Earth’s natural satellite. The journey marks Orion's first trip beyond our planet's orbit. In 2014, the spacecraft completed a two-orbit test flight around Earth. A successful flight would pave the way for a manned mission to the Moon and eventually NASA’s first crewed lunar landing since Apollo 17 in 1972.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="a572d02845f748c4ad6ba503082562f3"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">.<a href="https://twitter.com/NASA_Orion?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NASA_Orion</a> is performing extremely well and is now more than halfway to the Moon. Since launch, we've tested the optical navigation system and performed external inspections to assess the Orion's condition.

At that point, the spacecraft will perform the first of four main engine burns NASA has planned for the mission. At times, Orion will fly little more than 81 miles (130 kilometers) above the lunar surface. "We will be passing over some of the Apollo landing sites," Flight Director Jeff Radigan said. Four days later, NASA plans to conduct a second burn to put Orion in a distant orbit around the Moon before finally setting the spacecraft on a return trajectory toward the Earth. If all goes according to plan, Orion will land in the Pacific Ocean on December 11th.</p><p>Orion’s early successes are a welcome development after the troubles NASA encountered with its Space Launch System heavy-lift rocket. The space agency was forced to delay the launch of Artemis 1 multiple times due to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-watch-nasa-artemis-1-moon-launch-113048363.html">engine problems</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-sls-needs-repairs-183604852.html">hydrogen fuel leaks</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tropical-storm-ian-delays-artemis-1-launch-162655828.html">hurricane-force winds</a>. Early Wednesday morning, it appeared that the agency would be forced to delay the mission again after the SLS ground team discovered a leak in one of the fuel lines on the rocket’s launch tower. However, after NASA personnel tightened some bolts, the SLS lifted off, creating a dazzling nighttime display.</p>

## Epic lawsuit claims Google paid Activision Blizzard $360 million to prevent Play Store rival

<p>Google paid Activision Blizzard approximately $360 million to prevent the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-discrimination-abuse-video-163056567.html"><ins>troubled publisher</ins></a> from competing directly against the Play Store. The deal was one among at least 24 agreements the search giant signed as part of its Project Hug initiative, according to court documents seen by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-agreed-pay-360-mln-activision-stop-competition-epic-games-alleges-2022-11-17/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>.</p><p>The financial details of Project Hug – later known as the Apps and Games Velocity Program – are at the center of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-google-play-lawsuit-035741548.html"><ins>ongoing antitrust lawsuit between Epic Games and Google</ins></a>. In 2021, the studio alleged Google had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632818/google-project-hug-game-developers-play-store-millions-epic-lawsuit-complaint"><ins>spent millions of dollars in incentives</ins></a> to keep big app developers on the Play Store. This week, a newly unredacted version of Epic’s complaint was made public, providing previously unknown details about the scope of the Apps and Games Velocity Program.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the court documents, Google also signed deals with Nintendo, Ubisoft and Riot Games. In the case of Riot, Google paid about $30 million to “stop” the <em>League of Legends </em>studio from pushing forward with its own “in-house ‘app store’ efforts,” Epic alleges. Riot Games did not immediately respond to Engadget’s request for comment.</p><p>The lawsuit alleges Google knew signing with Activision would prompt the publisher to “abandon its plans to launch a competing app store," a claim Activision disputes. “Google never asked us, pressured us, or made us agree not to compete with Google Play,” an Activision spokesperson told <em>Reuters</em>. “Epic’s allegations are nonsense.”</p><p>Google did not immediately respond to Engadget’s request for comment. The company previously said it was “looking forward to setting the record straight” on Epic’s “inaccurate” claims.</p><p>“The program on which Epic and Match base their claims simply provides incentives for developers to give benefits and early access to Google Play users when they release new or updated content; it does not prevent developers from creating competing app stores, as they allege,” Google told Engadget in October after Epic and Match filed a motion to bring <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-match-group-google-motion-213036490.html"><ins>additional charges against the company</ins></a>. “In fact, the program is proof that Google Play competes fairly with numerous rivals for developers, who have a number of choices for operating systems and app stores.”</p>

<p>Tesla has issued a recall for 29,348 Model X vehicles, because their airbag might deploy incorrectly in some situations. This recall affects 2021 to 2023 Model X cars manufactured for customers in the US. According to the <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2022/RCLRPT-22V843-2702.PDF">recall notice</a> (PDF) published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the restraint control module calibration on those specific vehicles could cause the frontal passenger airbag to deploy "in an unintended configuration during certain low-speed collision events."</p><p>While the notice didn't illustrate the airbag's "unintended configuration," it said that it would result in noncompliance of the law when a child around three to six years old is seating in the front passenger seat without a seatbelt and out of position. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recalls-about-30000-model-x-cars-over-airbag-issue-2022-11-18/?taid=6378019317e95000011239f0&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter"><em>Reuters</em></a> notes Tesla's shares fell by 3 percent after the recall was published, leading to its lowest in nearly two years, but it's worth noting that the company says it's not aware of any "warranty claims, field reports, crashes, injuries, or deaths related to this condition."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Earlier this month, Tesla also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-power-steering-recall-model-s-model-x-164544014.html">recalled 40,168</a> Model S and Model X vehicles over a software defect that could potentially cut power steering assistance due to potholes and other bumps on the road. And in September, it issued a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-to-recall-more-than-a-million-vehicles-over-pinchy-windows-185041420.html">recall for over a million vehicles</a> because their window automatic reversal system could malfunction and pinch the driver or passenger.&nbsp;</p><p>Like those other recalls, though, owners don't have to turn their vehicles in or go anywhere for a fix at all.

On the downside, the smart lock only works with 2.4GHz WiFi networks, so you'll need to make sure your router is set up for that.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You'll be able to lock and unlock the door remotely, which could come in handy if a friend is stopping by to check on your home and water the plants while you're on vacation. There's the option to provide folks with timed-entry keys, meaning that they'll be able to enter a home on their own without having to wait for the resident to unlock the door manually. Because the August smart lock fits over an existing deadbolt, you'll still be able to use your same physical keys to open your door — so don't worry too much about the power going out when you're away from home.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>

<p>It's a good time to buy a TV that doubles as an art installation. Amazon is selling Samsung's 2022 Frame TVs at their best prices to date for Black Friday.

Thanks to a matte screen finish, the always-on art mode is more convincing than with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-the-frame-tv-irl-153546368.html">previous models</a> — it almost looks like a canvas painting that just happens to be a TV.

You won't get Samsung's absolute best image quality, so you may want to look to high-end conventional TVs like the mini LED-based QN85B if you don't need the artwork. Also, you'll typically need to pay for either an Art Store subscription or individual works if you want masterpieces from the likes of Da Vinci, Van Gogh and Vermeer. The Frame is a strong value at these prices, though, and makes plenty of sense if you were already planning to wall-mount your screen.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>

## Waymo will soon offer fully driverless rides to the public in San Francisco

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-cruise-approval-driverless-rides-california-070950457.html">Waymo</a> is one step closer to charging passengers for fully driverless rides in San Francisco. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has <a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/news-and-updates/all-news/cpuc-approves-new-driverless-autonomous-vehicle-service-under-pilot-program">granted</a> the company a Driverless Pilot permit, which allows it to pick up passengers in a test vehicle without a driver behind the wheel. It's only the second participant in the CPUC's Driverless Permit program, with Cruise being the first.&nbsp;</p><p>By securing the permit, Waymo now has the authority to offer driverless rides throughout San Francisco, portions of Daly City, as well as in portions of Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Mountain View, Palo Alto and Sunnyvale. Its vehicles are allowed to go as fast as 65 miles per hour and can operate 24/7, but the company can't charge for the rides just yet. Waymo told <em>Engadget</em> that it will begin offering free rides without a driver to select members of the public in the coming weeks. To note, the company has been offering free driverless rides <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-phoenix-public-193945960.html">to the public in Phoenix</a> since 2020.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/09/waymo-can-now-charge-for-fully-driverless-services-in-san-francisco/">authorized Waymo</a> to charge for fully autonomous rides. However, the company still has to secure a Driverless Deployment permit — the next step after this one — from the CPUC to be able to start doing so. The agency <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cruise-charge-fully-driverless-rides-san-francisco-092000547.html">gave Cruise</a> a deployment permit for robotaxis in June, almost a year after it was allowed to offer free rides to the public.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Cruise, Waymo likely won't be allowed to operate its vehicles during times of heavy fog and rain when it gets its deployment permit. Robotaxi companies have to find a way to overcome autonomous vehicles' performance issues in bad weather, however, if they want to be able to service more places and more people. Waymo is taking steps to address the problem and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-robotaxi-weather-station-maps-174012064.html">recently announced</a> that it's using its latest car sensor arrays to create real-time weather maps of Phoenix and San Francisco. The Alphabet-owned company will use the data it gathers to improve its Driver AI's ability to handle rough weather and to better understand the limits of its vehicles.&nbsp;</p><div id="d536e7525bf8467f8c11737d0cbbc792"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">SF, who’s ready to ride? 🚘🤖<br /><br />After receiving the driverless pilot permit from the <a href="https://twitter.com/californiapuc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@californiapuc</a>, Waymo One is opening to members of the public in San Francisco.
