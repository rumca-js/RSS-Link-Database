  <p id="5EPmuG">Wickr Me, the free encrypted messaging app owned by Amazon Web Services, is shutting down on December 31st, 2023. In <a href="https://wickr.com/our-focus-on-end-to-end-encrypted-enterprise-communications/">a post on its website</a>, Wickr says the app will stop accepting new user registrations on December 31st, 2022 before going away completely next year.</p>
<p id="K1zbKS"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550361/amazon-wickr-aws-secure-messaging-encryption">AWS acquired Wickr last year</a> and started packaging the paid version of the secure messaging app within its offerings for businesses. This version of the app, Wickr AWS, isn’t going away, and neither is Wickr Enterprise. The shutdown only affects the consumer-facing Wickr Me, which is often used by journalists, whistleblowers, and anyone looking to keep their messages away from prying eyes. </p>
<p id="isJhRJ">However, recent reports suggest the app has become an outlet for criminals, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/wickr-amazon-aws-child-messaging-app-sex-abuse-problem-rcna20674">with NBC...</a></p>

  <p id="qujcmH">Waymo can now provide driverless rides to passengers in San Francisco. On Friday, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) <a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/news-and-updates/all-news/cpuc-approves-new-driverless-autonomous-vehicle-service-under-pilot-program">said it granted</a> the Alphabet-owned Waymo a permit to participate in its driverless pilot program, which lets autonomous vehicle (AV) companies transport passengers in test AVs without anyone at the wheel.</p>
<p id="yAu0bp">Waymo still isn’t allowed to charge for these rides, though. The state of California requires companies to obtain a series of incremental permits from both the CPUC and the Department of Motor Vehicles before they’re able to charge for driverless rides. Waymo just needs to secure the driverless deployment permit from the CPUC to fully launch its robotaxi service, as it already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/11/23453262/waymo-av-driverless-taxi-phoenix-california-dmv-progress">received clearance from the...</a></p>

## Sony is slashing prices on PS5 games and accessories ahead of Black Friday

  <p id="NfDngf">Sony switched on some very good holiday deals on digital video games for PS5 and PS4, as well as PS5 accessories, like the DualSense controller. I won’t list out <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/pages/BlackFriday2022SeeAll/1">all of the game deals available at the PlayStation Store</a>, but <strong>here’s the best way to frame the significance of the game discounts</strong>: you can get three PS5-exclusive games, like, say, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA01473_00-RATCHETCLANKRIFT"><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em></a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA01284_00-RETURNALGAME0001"><em>Returnal</em></a>, and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA02225_00-GHOSTDIRECTORPS5"><em>Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut</em></a>, for less than $100 ($30 each). That’s a far cry from the original $70 cost for just one of these titles. Newer games, like <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA04072_00-FORBIDDENWESTPS5"><em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA01317_00-GT7STD0000000PS5"><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></a>, are a bargain at $39.89 each for the PS5 versions. And then there’s the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA05389_00-UNCHARTED4R00000"><em>Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection</em></a>, which costs just $19.89.</p>

<p id="nVAG6h">“Based on customer feedback, SwiftKey iOS has been relisted on the Apple App Store,” Microsoft’s Caitlin Roulston said in statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “Please visit <a href="https://support.swiftkey.com/hc/en-us/categories/200371942-iPhone-iPad">Support.SwiftKey.com</a> for more information.”</p>
<p id="OWAfSO">Despite the return, SwiftKey’s latest update is still from August 11th, 2021.
