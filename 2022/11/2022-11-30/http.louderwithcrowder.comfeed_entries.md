It's a reboot of the popular 2000s sitcom <em>That 70s Show</em>.  As someone who was a fan of the first show and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ashton-kutchers-character-ranch-pro-life" target="_blank">Netflix's The Ranch</a> (which featured a lot of the actors) and who grew up in the 90s, I thought the idea of a reboot could have promise.</p><p>Then I watched this trailer. And I no longer think that. In fact, the entire development department at Netflix needs my foot in their ass. Every employee. One ass at a time.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

</p>
<p><em>That 70s Show</em> was exactly what the name implies. A show about kids growing up in the 70s. It introduced us to Topher Grace (Eric), Laura Prepon (Donna), <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ashton-kutcher-spy-tiktok" target="_blank">Ashton Kutcher</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mila-kunis-oscars-will-smith" target="_blank">Mila Kunis</a>, Wilmer Valderrama, and Danny Masterson... <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/danny-mastersons-publicist-worst-excuse-alleged-rapey-ways" target="_blank">who we don't talk about anymore</a>. The show centers around Eric and Donna's daughter going to live with her grandparents for the summer.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Mayhaps there is more to it than this one-minute clip. But judging by the preview Netflix cut together to get us excited for the show, it looks like it failed to do what <em>Cobra Kai</em> gets right and every other reboot like this gets wrong. It looks like a parody of what it's based on. This sneak peek looks like it's making fun of <em>That 70s Show. </em>An odd decision, since fans of the original show would be the only audience interested in watching this.</p><p>I mean, c'mon. It's two decades later and the basement hasn't been renovated or cleaned at all? Just so we can see these 90s kids discover all these strange and odd artifacts from the 70s? Which as a side note, if I found a basket full of old flannels in the 90s I would think I hit the jackpot.</p><p>Redd and Kitty were a parody of what you would think Redd and Kitty would be like in the 90s. And the rest leaves the impression the show will be little more than lame references to the original show. Though of course, you have to do the iconic "sitting in the circle" scene.</p><p>We'll see if there is more to it than what Netflix is attempting to "tease" us with. What they are showing us so far sucks ass.</p><p><p>

## 'They brought this on themselves': Disney finally bends the knee... to Ron DeSantis?!

Instead, DeSantis scored a MASSIVE reelection win in November and Disney's woke CEO was shown the exits. Only to be replaced by the former CEO, who signaled they're taking a step back from politics. And of course, America's Governor took a victory lap.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>Florida passed the "Parental Choice in Education" law to give parents a voice to speak out against, among other things, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-disney-protests" target="_blank">injecting sexual instruction to five-year-olds</a>. Opponents of the bill who support sexual instruction of five-year-olds called it the "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-disney-phone-call" target="_blank">Don't Say Gay</a>" bill, claiming without evidence <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/search/?q=rubin+desantis" target="_blank">it literally outlawed saying "gay" literally</a>. They cried for Disney to do something. Disney CEO Bob Chapek sided with protestors over Florida families and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-disney-response" target="_blank">threatened to have the bill repealed</a>. DeSantis informed him that if Disney is going to take political stances, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-signs-disney-bill" target="_blank">they don't get their tax breaks</a>. Both the tax breaks and the CEO are now gone.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>Incoming CEO Bob Iger gave his first employee townhall, and one of his first orders of business was to signal the company will go back to taking a neutral position on political issues. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">EXCLUSIVE: I have obtained video from returning Disney CEO Bob Iger's first town hall with employees, in which he signals that he will work to "quiet things down" politically and move toward neutrality in the culture war.<a href="https://t.co/ZBGdHhxFVS">https://t.co/ZBGdHhxFVS</a> <a href="https://t.co/ZbMCZN4MlG">pic.twitter.com/ZbMCZN4MlG</a><br />— Christopher F.

Of course not. It can be distracting, and it can have a negative impact on the company. And to the extent that I can work to kind of quiet things down, I’m going to do that.</blockquote><p>DeSantis responded to Iger's comment, something along the lines of LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL! Or, at least that is what I assume he would want to say. But the governor of Florida needs to maintain professionalism and decorum.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Gov.

</p>
<p>We'll see where things go from here. Before Disney gets involved in any more political battles, they have another <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/strange-world-box-office" target="_blank">$100,000,000 "get woke, go broke" lesson to learn</a>. While the rest of us await America's Governor 's taking his blueprint on how to fight the culture war and win on a national tour.</p><p><p>

## New York Times capes for pedos, claims YOU'RE the conspiracy theorist for thinking Balenciaga ad was gross

You may have been disgusted by it due to your having morals and a sense of decency. Turns out, according to the New York Times, you are only offended because you watch too much Fox News, hunt for people in pizza places, and are too much a rube to understand "art."</p><p>To recap, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/balenciaga-cooper-kupp" target="_blank">Balenciaga released photos featuring children holding provocative Teddy Bear bags while </a><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/balenciaga-cooper-kupp">BDSM and alcohol props lined the bed</a>. They also released a second ad, where scattered on a cluttered desk <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/super-bowl-mvp-cooper-kupp-slams-balenciaga-controversial-ad-campaign?intcmp=tw_fnc" target="_blank">there was a copy of United States v. Williams</a>. It's a Supreme Court case about distributing child pornography.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">the brand "Balenciaga" just did a uh..... interesting... photoshoot for their new products recently which included a very purposely poorly hidden court document about 'virtual child porn'<br /><br />normal stuff <a href="https://t.co/zjMN5WhZ0s">pic.twitter.com/zjMN5WhZ0s</a><br />— shoe (@shoe0nhead) <a href="https://twitter.com/shoe0nhead/status/1594532715126202368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Gross, right? Only if you believe in QAnon according to the New York Times.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">How the Balenciaga controversy has become one of the most explicit collisions of internet culture, politics, fashion and conspiracy theories to date. With ⁦<a href="https://twitter.com/VVFriedman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@VVFriedman</a>⁩ and ⁦<a href="https://twitter.com/jtes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jtes</a>⁩ <a href="https://t.co/WoczAWlzLj">https://t.co/WoczAWlzLj</a><br />— Elizabeth Paton (@LizziePaton) <a href="https://twitter.com/LizziePaton/status/1597512045209042944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Feel free to click through if you want to give it traffic. But it can be summed up with the following lede: </p><blockquote>Two new Balenciaga campaigns ignited a firestorm that traveled from the internet to Fox News, fueled by allegations that the brand condoned child exploitation.</blockquote><p>It wasn't the photos exploiting children that fueled allegations the brand condoned exploiting children. It was Fox News. So sayeth the New York Times, to explain to the rubes what high art and fashion is. The copy of United States v. Williams was an unfortunate coincidence.</p><p>Or, it shows that at least one person working at the ad agency had a modicum of a conscience, and added it to the clutter knowing Balenciaga would miss it. They didn't miss the little girls holding bondage bears, though. They were all about those.</p><p>And the New York Times has their back, defending them against critics. It's not the photos that are the problem. It's YOU finding the photos promlemtic that's the problem. </p><p>To the New York Times, thinking child exploration, sexualizing children, and/or pedophilia are all bad things makes you no better than people who believe in QAnon.  And they wonder why so many Americans view the media as the enemy of the people.</p><p><p>

## Ron DeSantis sends strongest signal about running for president yet with announcement of February 2023 date

Or, more specifically, you may have heard that conservatives are hoping he's going to run, and are projecting our hopes and dreams onto him.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Note how there's nothing about quasi-celeb drama or fringe sideshow acts, and no rube-bait performance art like...I dunno, reading the Constitution.<br /><br />A serious, firm focus on real issues.<br /><br />This is how 2024 will be decided.<br /><br />Serious > Circus <a href="https://t.co/2XW2bZvUMo">https://t.co/2XW2bZvUMo</a><br />— Kurt Schlichter (@KurtSchlichter) <a href="https://twitter.com/KurtSchlichter/status/1597633102146256897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>DeSantis <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-pennssylvania-speech" target="_blank">sounds like a candidate</a>. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/desantis-wife-run-president-2024" target="_blank">His wife is on board</a>. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-victory-speech" target="_blank">He has a record to run on</a>. Whether he does or not? Maybe his new book being released on February 28, 2023 will lend some clues. "The Courage to Be Free: Florida's Blueprint for America's Revival." <br /></p><p>It is an <em>autobiography</em> that is also said to <em>highlight</em> DeSantis' "<em>bold, substantial policy achievements,"</em> and how those achievements in Florida are a blueprint for achievements that could be achieved... in America.</p><blockquote>What Florida has done is establish a blueprint for governance that has produced tangible results while serving as a rebuke to the entrenched elites who have driven our nation into the ground. Florida is proof positive that we, the people, are not powerless in the face of these elites.</blockquote><p>Oh, and the announcement of this book, written by an author who is highly considered to be considering a run to become the Republican presidential nominee, was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/blueprint-2024-desantis-pens-book-going-after-entrenched-elites-presidential-speculation-swirls" target="_blank">given to FOX NEWS as an exclusive</a>.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="3e559" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32235214&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>I understand that some of the rules have changed, but some are still standards. One is that when someone who is rumored to be considering a run for higher office announces a policy-based book it's a) a clear sign they are running for higher office (See <em>Pence, Mike</em>) unless something happens (see <em>Cuomo, Andrew</em>), and b) the person rumored to be considering a run for higher office KNOWS IT SENDS THE SIGN THEY ARE RUNNING.</p><p>Every move DeSantis is making is a signal to supporters, donors, and other officials that he is running for president. And while he should stick to his own timeframe I'm sure has been meticulously plotted, he HAS to run this cycle.

	Former actress and current Twitter user Alyssa Milano still refuses to calm down about Elon Musk buying Twitter. She took her crusade to 
	<em>The View</em>, the most trusted name in low-information, shrill harpery.
</p><p>
	Quick recap, Milano <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/alyssa-milano-tesla" target="_blank">got owned HARD in announcing</a> she was getting rid of her Tesla. So much so, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/alyssa-milano-cat" target="_blank">she shared some personal information about herself by accident</a>. The former actress is now the face of the anti-Elon Resistance, and she has many a grievance. At the top of the list, Elon bought Twitter instead of using his money to solve world hunger. That's something he could have done by *check notes* giving a non-profit $40 billion.

		Hysterical liberal activist Alyssa Milano claims

		Says if he wanted to "change the world," he would have given the $40 billion to her via UNICEF. "There would be no hunger," she proclaims.
		<br />
		Whoopi says he can pull that out of his pocket.

</blockquote></div><p>
	Here's the problem with Milano's new line of derp. Elon WANTED to solve world hunger, and it would have only cost him $6 billion.
</p><p>
	Musk <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-fix-global-hunger" target="_blank">was approached about doing so by the UN</a> -- on Twitter, obvi -- but they refused to accept Elon's terms of providing an accounting of how the money would be used to solve world hunger.
</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
		But it must be open source accounting, so the public sees precisely how the money is spent.

	There was also the time 
	<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-un-peacekeeper" target="_blank">UN Peacekeepers would (allegedly) exchange sandwiches</a> for oral sex from malnourished nine-year-olds.

It took<em> "almost a year for UN staff to respond to allegations of rape by six children."</em> One child reported he had been <em>"orally and anally raped."</em></p><p>In 2017, the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/world/africa/french-peacekeepers-un-sexual-abuse-case-central-african-republic.html" target="_blank">reported that no charges were brought.</a></p><p>Elon Musk can solve world hunger AND return free speech to Twitter. He has the money to do both. On the hunger front, he just wants an honest accounting of how the money is being spent and a pledge that the people distributing the food aren't going to have sex with children. Both those terms are fair.</p><p>If Alyssa is concerned about world hunger, she should work with Elon Musk and not be mean about him on television. </p><p><p>

## Jim Carrey overacts in announcing he's leaving Twitter... with a creepy cartoon about a lighthouse keeper

Which I guess just makes him... unemployed? The last performance of his that stands out is the one where he virtue signaled about guns after playing a character in <em>Kick-Ass 2</em> that killed a lot of people with guns. Now he's leaving Twitter, and why he didn't say his specific reason, we can guess.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>If you read the terms of service of your Twitter account, it states you are unable to leave Twitter without announcing to the world you are leaving Twitter. You just can't, like, you know, stop using Twitter. You have to declare you're leaving Twitter ON Twitter and hope you trend for it on Twitter. Jim Carrey is trending right now for announcing his departure with a creepy cartoon of a lighthouse keeper. It wouldn't be Jim Carrey if there wasn't overacting involved.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I’m leaving Twitter, but 1st here’s a cartoon I made with my friend Jimmy Hayward. It’s based on my painting of a crazy old Lighthouse Keeper, standing naked in a storm, summoning the angels and shining his lamp to guide us through a treacherous night.

<p>Friends, you may find yourself standing at a crossroads in life. You have two options between two Canadian-born American Icons to emulate. You can be Jim Carrey. Or you can <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/william-shatner-elon-musk-twitter" target="_blank">be William Shatner</a>. Be Shatner. He announced he's staying on Twitter, if for no other reason than to make fun of people like Jim Carrey making dramatic exits.</p><p><p>
