<p dir="ltr">Netflix founder and co-CEO Reed Hastings says that the company--almost happily, by most reports--agreed the streamer left money on the table with the limited release and booming ticket sales of ​​Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery. The sequel generated $15 million after screening in roughly 700 theaters nationwide over the Thanksgiving weekend.</p><p>"It's a promotional tactic for the streaming service like film festivals, and if it works well we will do more of it," Hastings said at the New York Times DealBook conference in New York City (via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/netflix-reed-hastings-disney-bob-iger-elon-musk-twitter-1235272443/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>). "We are not trying to build a theatrical business, we are trying to break through the noise."</p><p dir="ltr">Knives Out 2 includes a returning Daniel Craig as master detective Benoit Blanc, joined by an expansive ensemble cast. As you can see in the trailer below, the movie looks to be a madcap and truly nutty-fun time. Edward Norton plays a colorful tech billionaire named Miles Bron who invites his friends for a getaway on his private Greek island--but when someone turns up dead, Craig's Detective Benoit Blanc is put on the case.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-ceo-lots-of-money-left-on-table-with-limited-glass-onion-theatrical-release/1100-6509597/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>As the war in Ukraine broke out earlier this year, gameplay footage of the military simulator Arma 3 was passed off as actual videos from the ground of the conflict. Developer Bohemia Interactive has released a statement with the intention of assisting journalists and the general public in identifying fake videos.</p><p>Arma 3's nature as a mod-friendly military simulation game lets players simulate or depict a variety of historical and current conflicts. According to a part of the statement from a company representative, "Arma 3 videos allegedly depicted conflicts in Afghanistan, Syria, Palestine, and even between India and Pakistan." Bohemia has attempted to assist video platforms in flagging these videos on platform holders, such as YouTube. However, the sheer amount of videos makes this moderation task overwhelming and difficult.</p><p>The alternative is trying to make sure that the footage does not spread in the first place. The company representative said, "We found the best way to tackle this is to actively cooperate with leading media outlets and fact-checkers (such as AFP, Reuters, and others), who have better reach and the capacity to fight the spreading of fake news footage effectively." The statement follows this up with common attributes of Arma 3 footage that is being passed as videos from real-world conflicts, as well as a video which shows these principles in action.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arma-dev-speaks-out-about-game-being-used-as-fake-news-footage-in-ukraine-war/1100-6509589/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Final Fantasy 16 has been rated in Brazil, leading credence to rumors that preorders will go up in early December and that a release date trailer is coming soon.</p><p>The rating was first noticed by <a href="https://twitter.com/gematsu/status/1597820963298549760">Gemetsu</a>.

According to a translation via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-16-rated-december-announcement/">Insider Gaming</a>, the game includes sex scenes that are "not fully shown" and plenty of violence including "blood, intentional deaths, torture...victims suffering" and even "hate crimes."</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy XVI has been rated in Brazil: <a href="https://t.co/KlUEeEHRUK">https://t.co/KlUEeEHRUK</a><br /><br />Release date announcement and new trailer due out by the end of 2022: <a href="https://t.co/bs1NEUZ0jW">https://t.co/bs1NEUZ0jW</a><br /><br />Pre-orders rumored to open on December 7 or 8: <a href="https://t.co/LVKvKgCuqj">https://t.co/LVKvKgCuqj</a><br /><br />Gematsu page: <a href="https://t.co/6NDqHHhJ5i">https://t.co/6NDqHHhJ5i</a> <a href="https://t.co/VSkiMxOdWX">pic.twitter.com/VSkiMxOdWX</a></p>  — Gematsu (@gematsu) <a href="https://twitter.com/gematsu/status/1597820963298549760?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">November 30, 2022</a></blockquote>              </div><p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-xvi-pre-orders/">Insider Gaming</a> also reported last week that preorders for Final Fantasy 16 will go live on December 7 or 8.

<p dir="ltr">This year's Black Friday weekend was Amazon's biggest ever, and while gaming items sold well overall, only one made it into the best-selling items: the Nintendo Switch. Yes, more than six years after launch, Nintendo's groundbreaking console continues to do well at retail.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2022/11/amazon-announces-biggest-holiday-shopping-weekend-ever">Amazon's announcement</a>, the Switch sold well compared to other hot items, including Apple Airbods, Echo Dot, Fire TV Stick, and Hasbro Gaming Connect 4. The Meta Quest 2 also did very well for itself, making Amazon's electronics gift guide, along with the Switch, JBL Bluetooth speakers, and the Kindle Paperwhite.</p><p dir="ltr">While most Cyber Monday deals are sadly over by now, Amazon Prime members can still get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-members-can-get-8-free-games-in-december/1100-6509566/">eight free games</a> in December, including Quaker, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, and Banners of Ruin.

## Warhammer 40K Darktide Review In Progress - Left To Shred

<p>When I spoke to several teams making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-made-left-4-dead-special-according-to-the-devs-making-games-like-it/1100-6503996/">games in the Left 4 Dead lineage</a>, they each had some unique thoughts on why the game, and its resulting genre, works. But they also each echoed one similar thought: Pacing reigns supreme. Horde shooters, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide/">Warhammer 40K Darktide</a>, can live or die on the flow of its co-op missions. Aided by an AI director, missions must be tuned to reliably challenge, but not necessarily overwhelm the player. Impressively, Darktide gets this aspect of its grimdark missions exactly right, though the ways in which the game adds new layers on top of that don't always work quite as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Darktide is not just a Left 4 Dead-like, it's also the spiritual successor to Fatshark's previous series in the genre, Vermintide. Moving the experience out of the base Warhammer world and into the far-flung, grimdark future of Warhammer 40K comes with a major makeover both cosmetically and mechanically. The biggest new addition comes in the form of an arsenal of firearms that have no place in the hard fantasy of traditional Warhammer. But in the 40K era, things like hand cannons, assault rifles, and electricity-infused projectiles not only fit right in, but also dramatically alter the flow of combat by adding more range-based considerations.</p><p dir="ltr">This massive shift is well-implemented, as enemies will match you blow for blow. Fighting from a distance will see them trading shots and taking cover, and if you--or they--are able to close the gap, they'll quickly swap to melee combat. When this happens, Darktide leans into the still-great crowd-control elements first seen in Vermintide, where both nuanced swordfighting and mindless hacking and slashing are usually viable techniques--though on higher difficulties, the former naturally becomes more crucial.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-darktide-review-in-progress-left-to-shred/1100-6509564/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">The Smash World Tour, a major Super Smash Bros. tournament and competitive circuit, has been unexpectedly shut down. The Smash World Tour championships were set for December 9 in Texas, with many top Smash players buying air fare and travel accommodations ahead of time. Instead, that event will not occur, along with the entirety of the 2023 circuit.</p><p dir="ltr">The organizers of the Smash World Tour--a group of fans unaffiliated with Nintendo--say that Nintendo told them "without any warning" that they would no longer be able to operate the night before Thanksgiving. The organizers also say that they'll be losing "hundreds of thousands of dollars" due to this shutdown.</p><p dir="ltr">In response, Nintendo told <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-smash-world-tour-fgc-shut-down-panda-esports-1849833867">Kotaku</a> that the company did not request any changes to the Smash World Tour 2022, and that the dispute was solely about the upcoming 2023 circuit. The SWT organizers responded with a statement from Nintendo that seems to show that the company declined to grant a license for the Smash World Tour Championship in 2022. Needless to say, certain facts are in dispute here, and it's not clear how this situation will ultimately shake out.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-shuts-down-smash-world-tour-just-days-ahead-of-championship/1100-6509575/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Tatum, who will be working on spy thriller with writer-producer Simon Kinberg (The Martian, Logan) and director David Leitch (Deadpool 2), reportedly closed the deal on the Wednesday just before Thanksgiving.</p><p dir="ltr">Tatum also recently made waves with the first trailer for the third and final entry in his Magic Mike series, titled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/channing-tatum-returns-to-magic-mike-in-one-last-dance-trailer/1100-6509179/">Magic Mike's Last Dance</a>.

The first Magic Mike hit theaters a decade ago and was loosely based on the experiences of Tatum, who actually was an 18-year-old male stripper in Tampa, Florida. The film proved to be a sleeper hit, earning over $167 million against a $7 million budget.

## Marvel's Midnight Suns Review - XCOM Superhero Squad

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvels-midnight-suns/">Marvel's Midnight Suns</a>' story draws clear inspirations from the original Rise of the Midnight Sons comic book series from the 1990s in which Blade, Morbius, and Ghost Rider--among others--unite to fight against a recently resurrected Lilith and her army of demons. Developer Firaxis Games' title, however, incorporates more faces from the current Midnight Suns series, such as Wolverine, Magik, and Nico Minoru. In making these changes, it distances itself from the source material's idea that to defeat a monster, you need a team of monsters. Instead, it is a story about the power of friendship between a bunch of misfits, which is forged and strengthed through battle as much as traditional social scenarios. Midnight Suns aims to combine relationship-building with memorable role-playing moments, and the result is a stellar turn-based tactical combat title driven by interesting characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel's Midnight Suns begins with the Avengers in a tough spot--the prophesied return of an eldritch god is on the horizon, having been brought about by Lilith, who now leads an army of HYDRA soldiers and demonic children in a war against humanity. The Avengers aren't adequately prepared to tackle such a supernatural threat, so they turn to Doctor Strange and his newest apprentice, Scarlet Witch, for aid. After their first attempt at fighting Lilith goes sideways, Strange introduces the world's mightiest heroes to the contingency plan: the Midnight Suns, a group of young heroes who each wield magical, supernatural, or demonic powers.</p><p dir="ltr">That's where your character, The Hunter, comes in. As the child of Lilith, you possess incredible magical abilities, which is what helped you defeat her 300 years ago. That final duel left both you and Lilith dead, but just as HYDRA managed to bring your mother back to life, the Midnight Suns are able to do the same for you. Not content to leave the fate of the world up to others, the Avengers also decide to set up shop in the Midnight Suns' headquarters, The Abbey, to join the fight against Lilith.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-midnight-suns-review-xcom-superhero-squad/1900-6418006/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Willow Review - You ARE Great

<p dir="ltr">Back in 1988, Ron Howard directed a fantasy movie written by George Lucas and Bob Dolman that followed a character named Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis), who becomes the caretaker of a child he finds. That child happens to be a chosen one foretold to take down evil Queen Bavmorda. Ultimately, Bavmorda was banished, and while the movie didn't make box office records when it was released, it's still a beloved movie by many people. And now, a sequel series has arrived on Disney+. However, 1988 and 2022 are two entirely different eras of filmmaking, can Willow live up to those who view '80s through rose-colored glasses? Surprisingly, yes.</p><p dir="ltr">The new Disney+ series once again follows Willow as he's recruited by a group to go on a rescue mission, and very quickly, we find that there's a connection to the first film driving a lot of this story, and of course, the forces of evil that are standing in these heroes' way. It's an adventure that really kicks things off from the first couple of episodes, so the details of this group traveling, and who they are, all become a little bit of a spoiler for the season as a whole.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">In an era of bundles and bundles of high-quality content being released weekly through various streaming platforms, cable TV, and VOD, it can be hard to grab the attention of a view. If it isn't engaging by the end of Episode 1, why should we bother? Luckily, Willow kicks things off with a quick recap of the original film." It's all the necessary information you need in order to dive right in because Willow doesn't have time to spare, and the things that aren't over-explained are part of the fun and mystery. We're not in the worlds of Lord of the Rings, Wheel of Time, or Game of Thrones. Things aren't overly-complicated here. It's pretty straight-forward fantasy that's a lot more grounded in reality than other shows in its genre. The first episode feels like you're coming home. Willow feels like Willow, even though technology behind the production has changed quite a bit.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/willow-review-you-are-great/1900-6418005/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
