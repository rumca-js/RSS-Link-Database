<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>The upcoming Microsoft Designer is a visual art design tool that you simply <em>must </em>try for yourself. It&rsquo;s simply one of the best consumer apps Microsoft has ever made, following in the footsteps of Clipchamp.</p>



<p>Why use Designer? Two reasons: AI art and templates. In Designer, you can combine apparently unlimited amounts of AI art with intelligently suggested templates that can generate finished projects in just seconds. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1346579/microsoft-will-bring-ai-art-to-windows-edge.html">Microsoft announced Microsoft Designer</a> in October, and it&rsquo;s currently locked to a small group of testers in preview mode. PCWorld obtained access via preview codes shared on Twitter, and that&rsquo;s the way Microsoft is slowly adding users&mdash;after you download your first creation, you&rsquo;ll be given a code for three additional Designer licenses that you can share with whomever you&rsquo;d like. Microsoft Designer will eventually be part of Microsoft 365, though the AI art features will apparently be shared with Image Creator, a tool for Microsoft Edge.</p>



<p>Interestingly, though, Designer is very much <em>not</em> an enterprise tool, at least for now. The preview codes being shared do not work with enterprise or education accounts. Instead, only consumer versions of Microsoft accounts can use Microsoft Designer, which feels very much in keeping with the overall theme&mdash;this is a consumer tool, first and foremost.</p>



<p>In fact, Designer feels very much like the complement to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/708192/how-to-use-clipchamp-microsofts-video-editor.html">Microsoft Clipchamp, the fantastic web-based video editor</a> launched earlier this year. Microsoft bought Clipchamp, and it&rsquo;s not clear where Designer&rsquo;s resources were pulled from. But Designer&rsquo;s UI and layout feel reminiscent of  Clipchamp, with more polish. If you&rsquo;ve set up a new Windows 11 PC recently, it will all feel familiar. But as our hands-on review of Clipchamp noted, the web-based nature of the app introduces some wrinkles. My Designer tabs that I had open generated an error message when I returned to them the next morning, forcing me to reload the page. (My project, though, was intact.)</p>



<h2 id="how-to-use-microsoft-designer">How to use Microsoft Designer</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Designer getting started" class="wp-image-1419115" height="641" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Getting-started.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Microsoft Designer is simply brilliant at delivering professional-quality designs, fast. Here&rsquo;s how you begin.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Chances are, you&rsquo;ll be able to whip out a professional-looking image in, honestly, just a few minutes. Designer doesn&rsquo;t waste any time: After a short animation at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://designer.microsoft.com&amp;xcust=2-1-1419066-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">designer.microsoft.com</a>, Designer gets right to work. There are three points of entry: what you want to say, what you want to show, and what you want to create.</p>



<p>Where Designer shines is how it intelligently uses whatever signals you give it to get your design off the ground. Type &ldquo;Happy 50th Wedding Anniversary&rdquo; into the <em>Your design headline (Add text)</em> field, and Designer will create a number of anniversary cards in just a few seconds, with imagery of rings and cakes. Enter &ldquo;Little League Pizza Party&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll see about a dozen different designs featuring background images of pizza, with various fonts and layouts. </p>



<p>It&rsquo;s AI, but not the flashy kind: just a smart, helpful app contributing what it can and then getting out of the way.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Designer 50th wedding anniversary" class="wp-image-1419111" height="643" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Happy-50th-Wedding-Anniversary.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Microsoft Designer just needs a few words from you to start making suggestions.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Designer also allows you to start with an image or photo you have saved on your computer. Here, Designer can&rsquo;t really tell what message you&rsquo;re trying to get across, so you&rsquo;ll have to tweak the layouts to get across the intent&mdash;say, an invitation, or &ldquo;wish you were here.&rdquo; Designer seemed to do a pretty good job of correctly identifying the focal point of a photo to center.</p>



<p>Once you select a template, you can always make quick changes on the fly to another template, too. You can also use some of the suggested elements (that you see to the left of the workspace) to add to the scene. But, honestly, the templates are so clean and polished that it almost seems like a waste to clutter it up.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Designer wish you were here" class="wp-image-1419114" height="604" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Editing-design.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>I selected this by first uploading  a picture of a Bay Area sunset, then selecting from the available templates. There are even more to the far right.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="designers-ai-art-is-powerful-not-flashy">Designer&rsquo;s AI art is powerful, not flashy</h2>



<p>Designer also downplays what should be the centerpiece of the app: AI art. The third field on the Designer start page is <em>Generate an image using a description</em>, and it&rsquo;s certainly the sexiest part of Designer: the ability to create custom backgrounds of just about anything. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/788422/how-to-get-started-with-ai-art-dall-e-mini-ai-dungeon-and-more.html">AI art started to take off</a> this past summer, and the concept is simple: Enter a text description of what you want to see, however fantastical, and the AI service will attempt to create it. A wedding scene on the back of a beach ball? A gorilla at the dentist in the style of Andy Warhol? A pencil sketch of a koala samurai? These are all possible. </p>



<p>In fact, once you type in your text prompt, Microsoft will then list suggestions that tweak it even further, to give you ideas of how to adjust the final result. It&rsquo;s honestly a trifle confusing, as it&rsquo;s not wholly intuitive that you simply need to click the purple arrow icon to begin generating the results, which will give you three to choose from.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose"><img alt="Microsoft Designer AI image art" class="image-compare__image-before" height="1291" id="1419224" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AI-image.png" width="1221" /><img alt="Microsoft Designer AI image art result" class="image-compare__image-after" height="1297" id="1419223" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AI-image-2.png" width="1230" /></div><figcaption>No, the result isn&rsquo;t perfect, but this AI art is a really good response to what sounds like a random query in Microsoft Designer.</figcaption></figure><p>AI art nerds will be interested to know that there are apparently <em>no</em> limits on how many images you can create. Microsoft has said before that instead of using the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1338403/the-grandfather-of-ai-art-dall-e-is-now-free-for-you-to-try.html">older DALL-E algorithm</a>, it&rsquo;s using the more sophisticated DALL-E 2 algorithm. My prompts took about a dozen seconds to produce results. While you can&rsquo;t directly save the results to your hard drive (Designer uses them as the genesis for new projects) you can right-click and open or save the images in a new tab. Doing so reveals that Microsoft is generating 1,024&times;1,024 images.</p>



<p>There are some restrictions: You can&rsquo;t use one of your own images as the source of the AI art. There&rsquo;s no apparent inpainting or outpainting, the terms used to limit the AI to a certain portion of a scene. </p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t expect any risqu&eacute; birthday cards, either: trying for topless or even &ldquo;pinup&rdquo; images generated a rather generic error message (&ldquo;We were unable to generate an image this time.&rdquo;) Celebrity images seemed to work, but not political figures like Donald Trump. &ldquo;Barry Bonds dressed as an airline pilot&rdquo; and &ldquo;George Washington and Abraham Lincoln in a boxing match&rdquo; produced results, though the latter presidents are long dead. The representations of actors like Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are off enough that you probably won&rsquo;t bother, either.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Microsoft Designer AI art Barry Bonds" class="wp-image-1419236" height="1024" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Barry-Bonds-as-an-airline-pilot.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption>Is this  home run king Barry Bonds as an airline pilot? Microsoft Designer seems to think so.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Microsoft is undoubtedly using its Azure cloud network to generate the AI images, which will help bring AI art from a rather <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/820518/midjourneys-ai-art-goes-live-for-everyone.html">prized luxury like Midjourney</a> to a commodity in a matter of months. But Microsoft has rather archly moved past all that: Microsoft&rsquo;s stance seems to be that AI art is just another tool to quickly create lovely, finished pieces to be shared among friends, colleagues, clients, and customers.</p>



<h2 id="designers-editing-tools-are-sprinkled-with-ai-too">Designer&rsquo;s editing tools are sprinkled with AI, too</h2>



<p>Microsoft takes the same &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just a tool&rdquo; approach to more detailed editing. If you move elements of the page around, expect to see visual guides to help you line them up with other elements on the page. You don&rsquo;t need to add custom-generated AI art, either; Designer will let you search in-app for something like a &ldquo;beach scene on Maui&rdquo; and return dozens of photos that you can add to your creation, with various tweaks like opacity, size, and so on. </p>



<p>Did you find a nice shot of your child holding your cat? The in-app AI will let you blur the background of that photo or else remove it entirely. It&rsquo;s not perfect, and seems to lack the specific tools of say, a Photoshop. But again, it&rsquo;s quick, and generally effective.</p>



<p>What&rsquo;s nice is that we&rsquo;re seeing some of these tools that Microsoft has scattered within its other apps finally coming together within Designer. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397798/how-to-use-paint-3d-magic-select-tool-to-edit-out-shapes-objects-and-people-from-photos.html">Paint 3D&rsquo;s Magic Select</a>, for example, seems to be the genesis for Designer&rsquo;s background-removal feature. Designer also provides an <em>Inspire Me</em> button in the <em>Visuals</em> tab, which tries to (I think) bring an image more in line with the project as a whole; we&rsquo;ve seen a similar AI tool in the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1073199/microsoft-makes-octobers-photos-app-available-to-insiders.html">Photos app</a> within Windows. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Designer visual tools" class="wp-image-1419250" height="651" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Visuals.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>This is a pretty amateurish effort that I  was playing around with, just to highlight the various options you can apply to the visuals, as seen on the left.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Interestingly, Microsoft is making no distinction between a &ldquo;free&rdquo; tier and a &ldquo;premium&rdquo; tier, as it does with Clipchamp. Maybe that&rsquo;s because Designer is part of Microsoft 365. But it&rsquo;s very possible that Microsoft is consciously taking aim at rival Canva, which offers Canva Premium for $12.99 per month. Canva Premium includes background removal, premium animations, and a database of over 100 million premium photos, along with a terabyte of cloud storage per month. All these sound similar to what Microsoft Designer and Microsoft 365 potentially offer, though I don&rsquo;t yet see the diversity of Designer templates that Canva claims to offer.</p>



<p>About the only thing I don&rsquo;t like about Designer is that there is an opt-out (not opt-in) watermark, so when it comes time to save your creation, you have to make sure you check the correct box. Otherwise, Designer makes it super simple to complete your project: You can download your creation, or you can simply share it on Instagram, Facebook, or LinkedIn directly from Designer. You can even share the image to your phone; Designer will create a QR code that your phone can scan to download the image. (This didn&rsquo;t work for me, but that&rsquo;s likely because my Android phone defaults to Chrome, and there are likely permission issues with the beta software.)</p>



<p>I also noticed the absence of a link to or integration with printing services&mdash;if Designer allows you to whip up your own slick, professional e-book cover, poster, or greeting card in seconds, why not offer the option of printing out your finished project on some nice, thick card stock?</p>



<p>Otherwise, Designer is already excellent: fast, efficient, smart, simple, and slick. Along with Clipchamp, it&rsquo;s the best consumer-facing service I&rsquo;ve seen from Microsoft in years. There&rsquo;s a creative renaissance under way at Microsoft&mdash;and we&rsquo;re seeing it happen, app by app.</p>

## Windows 11’s borked gaming performance is mostly fixed, Microsoft says

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>A couple of weeks ago Microsoft confirmed what gamers suspected: the big 2022 update to Windows 11 was affecting the performance of high-end games. It said as much in an official bug-tracker, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379190/the-latest-windows-11-update-impacts-game-performance.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">delayed the rollout of the big 2022 Update</a> for quite a few users. According to the same changelog, the issue isn&rsquo;t fully resolved, but it&rsquo;s now limited to only &ldquo;small subset of games and apps.&rdquo; So the latest update is heading out to a lot more users. </p>



<p>The update was spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/30/23485717/microsoft-windows-11-gaming-performance-issues-fix&amp;xcust=2-2-1418844-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, and indeed, I can confirm that my desktop with an Nvidia GPU got the Windows 11 2022 Update last night. Exactly what the problem was &mdash; is? &mdash; is still somewhat nebulous. Microsoft originally blamed the issue on games &ldquo;inadvertently enabling GPU performance debugging features not meant to be used by consumers.&rdquo; Based on the advice to update games and apps to the latest versions, we can infer that the problem can be solved by updates to the software itself instead of Windows. </p>



<p>Presumably that&rsquo;s why the safeguard hold (which prevents the update from going out to users who might have issues) is now limited to a much smaller subset of users with those affected games and apps. Microsoft <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-22h2#2950msgdesc&amp;xcust=2-2-1418844-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has yet to mark the issue as &ldquo;resolved&rdquo; in its bug tracker</a>, which indicates that there&rsquo;s still work to be done. Whether that work is by Microsoft itself, developers of the affected games and programs, or some combination of the two, wasn&rsquo;t made clear. </p>

<p>My last look at a Vantrue dash cam was the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/831136/vantrue-element-1-review-dash-cam.html">Element 1 (E1)</a>, a clever, compact design with weak video captures. Day captures were passable, but important details in night captures such as license plate numbers were nearly impossible to discern. To optimize the image required either adding or removing a polarizing filter.</p>



<p>That was then; the three-channel Element 3 (E3) is <em>now</em>, and it&rsquo;s a different animal entirely, producing very good captures day and night from all three of its cameras. Good on the company for the polished comeback. </p>



<p>Of course, the E3 is also twice the price at $300, but in performance and features, it&rsquo;s competitive with the top-ranked <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/549488/cobra-sc400d-dash-cam-review-three-channels-fantastic-video-and-beaucoup-features.html">Cobra SC 400D</a>, which costs $100 more. The E1 wasn&rsquo;t competitive with a whole lot when it came to video. </p>

<h2 id="vanture-element-3-design-and-features">Vanture Element 3: Design and features</h2>



<p>The Element 3, as the name hints at, is a three-channel system featuring 160-degree field-of-view 1440p front captures, plus 165-degree FOV/1080p interior and 160-degree FOV rear captures. All at 30 frames per second. There&rsquo;s also a 2560x1994p mode for the front camera, though the uptick in detail is mild. </p>



<p>Note that 1994p takes around 120MB of storage per minute, 1440p takes about 100MB, and the 1080p less than 80MB per minutes. Recordings are, of course, deleted as need be (unless saved by you or the camera), but the larger the TF (micro SD) card, the better. The Element 3 will accept up to 512GB (U3/Class10/A2).</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1379801" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Vantrue-Element-3-1994p.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Element 3 has a 1994p mode, but it&rsquo;s the same 2560 horizontally for a narrower appearance even with greater vertical detail.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The front and interior cameras are housed in the same single body, while the rear camera attaches to the back window and is connected via a cable. All connections are Type-C. Nice. </p>



<p>However, this brings me to the one issue I had with the Element 3&mdash;the cable that connects the rear camera to the main body uses straight rather than right-angled Type-C connectors. </p>



<p>The cable being thick makes it somewhat difficult to bend and the straight connections stick out in ungainly fashion. This made hiding the cable difficult on the rear window, and negatively affected my ability to place the front camera where I wanted it. Hardly a deal breaker, but puzzling on such an otherwise clever design.</p>



<p>Note that there are angled Type-C adapters available on Amazon for less than $10. Not that that excuses Vantrue.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1380926" height="859" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Vantrue-E3-a.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The three main components of the Element 3: front camera (interior is on the back), rear camera, and Bluetooth emergency save button. The dotted lines are Vantrue&rsquo;s attempt to tell you that the lens body is positionally adjustable.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Vantrue might&rsquo;ve mitigated the effect on front placement if you could connect the rear camera to the semi-adhesive mount, but that only supports the Type-C power cable, which, ironically, is angled! If you forego the rear camera, you can connect the angled power cable to the main body. Then again, buy a cheaper front/interior camera is that&rsquo;s what you want.</p>



<p>While the semi-adhesive mount of the front/interior unit is adjustable only vertically, the front camera&rsquo;s lens body can be tilted both vertically and horizontally&mdash;a clever trick I haven&rsquo;t seen before. It will also accept the optional $20 polarizing filter. The rear camera also uses a sticky mount. </p>



<p>The Element 3 opts for physical multi-function buttons on the bottom of the main body rather than a touch display for navigating features and setting things up. Said setup was relatively easy and you&rsquo;re walked through the process when you first power on the camera. The provided display, while not touch, is a very crisp and colorful 2.5-inch IPS unit with wide viewing angles.</p>



<p>Vantrue includes a Bluetooth remote &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; button that can be mounted in a convenient location so you don&rsquo;t have to reach up to the camera to save a snapshot or the current video.</p>



<p>The E3 also supports voice commands, including such all-time hits as: &ldquo;video start&rdquo; (start recording), &ldquo;take photo,&rdquo; &ldquo;lock the video&rdquo; (emergency file save), &ldquo;turn off/on audio&rdquo; (microphone off), &ldquo;turn off/on screen,&rdquo; &ldquo;turn on/off Wi-Fi,&rdquo; &ldquo;show front/rear camera,&rdquo; and &ldquo;inside video on.&rdquo;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1381010" height="829" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Vantrue-Element-3-app-multi.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Vantrue Cam app lets you offload videos and track your travels with the GPS info.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Of course, everything must connect to your phone these days and the E3 does that. I wax cynically, but the app is very handy, allowing you to offload videos and interact with the embedded GPS info to see exactly where you&rsquo;ve been. Note that the E3 and phone communicate via Wi-Fi so your phone will lose its Wi-Fi internet.</p>



<h2 id="vanture-element-3-video-and-performance">Vanture Element 3: Video and performance</h2>



<p>Having been singularly unimpressed with the Vantrue Element 1&rsquo;s video (especially at night), it was nice to see the company back on its game with the Element 3. The video captures from all three cameras were excellent during the day. Of course the 1440p front was more detailed than the 1080 interior and rear captures, but all still showed good detail, color and motion compensation. </p>



<p>I&rsquo;m paying special attention to the latter these days after my recent experience with the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/831118/garmin-drivecam-76-review.html">Garmin DriveCam 76</a> and its shot-through-jello wobbling issues. (Once a hallmark of older GoPro technology.) The Element 3&rsquo;s capture quality isn&rsquo;t quite the best I&rsquo;ve seen, but it keeps the horizon steady.</p>



<p>As with the Element 1, I found the front captures slightly over-exposed at the default setting. This can be ameliorated in the settings section. All the captures shown below were taken at the default exposure settings.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1379652" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Vantrue-Element-3-front.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The E3&rsquo;s normal 16:9 2560&times;1440 mode offers plenty of resolution and uses less memory than the already discussed 1994p mode. </figcaption></figure></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1379653" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Vantrue-Element-3-interior.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Pilot and co-pilot on a daytime test run via the interior 1080p camera.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jon Jacobi</p></div>



<p>You might notice an extremely faint horizontal line through the rear captures (the first is directly below). It&rsquo;s a heater wire, not a defect in the camera. It&rsquo;s what happens when you install without measuring. Regardless, you can see that the general quality from the rear camera is quite good.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1379654" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Vantrue-Element-3-rear.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The 1080p rear camera  has a better default exposure setting than the front.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I did have to reduce the g-sensor sensitivity to stop the camera from saving everything in the &ldquo;Event&rdquo; folder. But that&rsquo;s not unusual for my car with its stiff street/track suspension (Ohlins, if you must know). </p>



<p>The Element 3&rsquo;s biggest area of improvement over the Element 1 is the night captures shown below. They were A-OK all around&mdash;i.e., from all three cameras. This is, again, without the polarizing filter.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1379655" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Vantrue-Element-3-night-front.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>This E3&rsquo;s night capture is vastly better than the Element 1&rsquo;s. Detail is good both directly in front and in the surrounding areas.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Above is the front nighttime capture, which shows far more detail with the Element 1. Below, you can see that the nighttime interior shots are also great thanks to the infrared lighting.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1379656" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Vantrue-Element-3-night-interior.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Infrared lighting  helps capture detail in the cabin area. It even shows detail outside the rear window. Kewl.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>You can even discern detail out the rear window using the interior camera, and there&rsquo;s none of the blow-out from the infrared that you see with some cheaper units. </p>



<p>The rear captures at night are more than passable, as well. Note that my window wasn&rsquo;t pristinely clean and there&rsquo;s still the blurry line in the middle from the heater wire. Sorry, I was finished testing by the time I discovered it. Don&rsquo;t make the same mistake with placement if you want perfect captures.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1379657" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Vantrue-Element-3-night-rear.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The rear night captures are just as good as those taken during the day. In fact, they&rsquo;re better than the front captures we saw from the Element 1.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>One small issue with the E3 was super sensitive/aggressive power cycling. Merely turning the ignition key from interior power-on to crank-the-starter position caused the camera to shut down and restart. Not a huge deal, but a tad annoying and it takes 10 seconds or so before you&rsquo;re recording again.</p>



<p>If you haven&rsquo;t read our &ldquo;What to look for&rdquo; section in our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/428348/best-dash-cam-reviews.html">Best dash cams roundup</a>, a super capacitor such as that in the E3 will last many more charge cycles and function better in the cold, but rarely keep the camera powered on for longer than it takes to save files. Batteries allow the camera to stay on longer in case the 12-volt is killed in in incident, but eventually wears out and doesn&rsquo;t perform well under really cold conditions. </p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-vantrue-element-3">Should you buy the Vantrue Element 3?</h2>



<p>The Element 3 proves Vantrue back on point in terms of video captures and design&mdash;the adjustable lens body is a particularly clever feature. If it weren&rsquo;t for the ungainly rear camera cable and slightly over-zealous default exposure setting on the front camera, I&rsquo;d have no complaints at all. Still, it&rsquo;s a worthy bargain of a three-channel system. </p>

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Keychron continues to wow us with its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/823922/keychron-q5-mechanical-keyboard-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Q series keyboards</a>, which incorporate premium features from boutique mechanical builds into designs that are attainable (if not exactly cheap). While they&rsquo;re all lookers, the Q series keyboards are a long way from portable, and they won&rsquo;t appeal unless you&rsquo;re already a fan of big, chunky mechanical keyboards. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-s1-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard?variant=40299845910617&amp;xcust=2-1-1418684-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Enter the Keychron S1</a>: a new design that combines the low-profile looks of Keychron&rsquo;s portable wireless designs with the more premium materials and features of the pricier boards. </p>



<p>The S1 uses a 75% layout, with a full function row and arrow cluster, plus a few extra keys like page up and down. The milled aluminum case and Gateron low-profile mechanical switches (clicky blue, tactile brown, or linear red) make the entire package just 13.7mm tall sans keycaps. The keyboard includes removable feet to adjust the typing angle from three degrees to six, and naturally, every key is backlit. Each board comes with high-quality PBT keycaps, which is nice, since your options for custom keycaps will be much more restricted than with regular MX switches. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Keychron S1 keyboard exploded view " class="wp-image-1418756" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/keychrons1lowprofileqmkkeyboarde.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Keychron</p></div>



<p>But those are fairly pedestrian features for keyboards these days, albeit not usually seen in low-profile designs. For the true customizer, the S1 has optional hot-swap switches (with choices somewhat limited by the form factor), full QMK and VIA programming, and a 1000Hz polling rate to keep gamers happy. Inside the case is sound-absorbing foam, to keep your housemates/coworkers sane. The only feature that seems to have been omitted is wireless functionality &mdash; it seems odd to me that such a small, bag-friendly keyboard is limited to a USB-C connection. The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k1-se-wireless-mechanical-keyboard&amp;xcust=2-1-1418684-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">similarly-proportioned K series</a> manages it. I&rsquo;d rather have Bluetooth and a battery than the somewhat antiquated Mac/PC hard switch. </p>



<p>The Keychron S1 is shipping now, starting at $109 for the base model with white LEDs and your choice of switches. Upgrading to full RGB lighting will cost you $119, and a further hot-swap upgrade brings the fully-laden price to a reasonable $129. Expect more S-series keyboards in a variety of sizes over the next few months. </p>

## How Mastodon and the Fediverse put social networks in the people’s hands

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>The Internet is getting weird again. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1381758/dont-get-scammed-why-you-cant-trust-elon-musks-twitter-right-now.html">Twitter&rsquo;s recent stumbles</a> under new ownership have surprisingly shined a quick light on the world of federated and decentralized social networking services, like Mastodon. These services are peer-to-peer or community-run networks, depending on the particulars. Federated services are services that are managed by individual organizations or &ldquo;offices,&rdquo; such as the Post Office, email, or self-hosted forums.</p>



<p>If you were on the Internet &ldquo;back in the day,&rdquo; you might remember when everyone connected through a variety of different forums or IM client accounts while having their own personal pages on Geocities or Blogspot. The rise of federated services is reminiscent of that. If you&rsquo;re used to &ldquo;modern&rdquo; social media from 2012 or so onward, all of this can be really confusing at first glance&mdash;which is understandable! A lot of jargon is being thrown around, and much of the established norms are being abandoned.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Have no fear! </strong>This is your guide to the federated universe (coined the &ldquo;Fediverse&rdquo;), and what it all means for you and for the future of social media/networking. Since the biggest crowd of Twitter refugees seems to be heading towards Mastodon, let&rsquo;s look at what you need to get started there, first. From there, we&rsquo;ll dive deeper into the underlying concepts and systems that make federated services work, as well as highlight some other specialized networks you can try&mdash;like PixelFed and PeerTube&mdash;which take that idea beyond mere Twitter clones into a full web experience.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Eugen Rochko is the creator of Mastodon" class="wp-image-1410101" height="845" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1-eugen_twitter_instance.png" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>Eugen Rochko is the creator of Mastodon</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>By the time you&rsquo;re done reading this you&rsquo;ll have a full grasp of federated services&mdash;and their potential.</p>



<h2 id="meet-mastodon">Meet Mastodon</h2>



<p>Before we jump into the super nitty gritty, let&rsquo;s take a look at one of the big services gaining traction right now: <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://joinmastodon.org/&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Mastodon</a>.</p>



<p>Mastodon has been exploding over the past few weeks, with over <em>1 million</em> new daily active users being involved just <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/109330358838921654&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">since the end of October</a>. According to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://bitcoinhackers.org/@mastodonusercount/109389467419829730&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">this Mastodon signup tracking bot</a>, there&rsquo;s more than 7 million total accounts, with 2000 being made every hour. Momentum is gaining for Mastodon, which has been around since 2016.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Mastodon users over time" class="wp-image-1410093" height="541" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2-masto_users.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Image via mastodonusercount bot</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>Mastodon itself is very much a Twitter-like service. It&rsquo;s a microblogging tool in which you send mostly short-form text posts, a few images or very small (40MB is the current limit) videos, build threads, follow and reply to other people, and &ldquo;boost&rdquo; (the equivalent of sharing or Retweeting) posts. There&rsquo;s also messaging, though it&rsquo;s not yet as fully developed as many might hope. You&rsquo;d be forgiven for taking one glance at it and thinking &ldquo;wow, that&rsquo;s generic Twitter.&rdquo; In a way, that&rsquo;s the point.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Mastodon on the web" class="wp-image-1410111" height="587" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/3-masto_web.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>At first glance, Mastodon&rsquo;s layout very much resembles Twitter.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>But Mastodon is missing all the profit-centric bloat of modern social media platforms. There&rsquo;s no algorithm recommending you content or people to follow. Unlike Twitter or Facebook, where the goal is to keep you glued to the screen as much as possible and never leaving their website, Mastodon is just there to provide a social networking place for you to have conversations. Humans don&rsquo;t communicate with algorithms by nature. But also, the point with Mastodon is to make friends, not follow brands.</p>



<p>Instead, you get a linear feed of the posts the people you follow make (or boost). When you first join, this means your feed may seem empty or lonely&mdash;especially if you&rsquo;re on the &ldquo;official&rdquo; mobile apps. The better alternatives (such as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keylesspalace.tusky&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tusky</a> on Android or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metatext/id1523996615&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Metatext</a> on iOS) feature &ldquo;Local&rdquo; and &ldquo;Federated&rdquo; timelines to help you find more people. Your individual instance (read: community server) admins may have suggested accounts to follow from that community when you sign up, too. Otherwise, you can search for hashtags and follow them, or follow people posting cool stuff in those hashtags relevant to your interests. If you&rsquo;re migrating from Twitter, some of the people you&rsquo;ve followed over there may have publicized Mastodon handles you can follow as well.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Mastodon explore tab" class="wp-image-1410100" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4-explore.png?w=840" width="840" /><figcaption><p>You can still keep your finger on the pulse while on Mastodon, with trending news, links, and trending hashtags showing you what conversations are happening &ndash; all approved by your instance admins to help keep the junk out.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>In those alternative Mastodon apps, the &ldquo;Local&rdquo; timeline will be anyone in your instance, and the &ldquo;Federated&rdquo; timeline is a &ldquo;mutuals&rdquo; timeline featuring anyone that anyone in your instance, or that you follow, has connections to. Think of it as a &ldquo;6 degrees of Kevin Bacon&rdquo; kind of thing. The Federated feed is more akin to the r/all page on Reddit (without upvotes) and is generally not the most fun place to be, but it can be interesting to browse.</p>



<p>You can reply to posts, and replies can be limited in privacy to public (shows up in Home timelines and hashtag searches), unlisted (shows up in followers&rsquo; Home timelines and on your profile, but not in Local or Federated timelines or hashtag searches), and private (which only show up to the recipient). You can &ldquo;boost&rdquo; posts, which just puts them in your timeline, including Local and Federated timelines. You can also &ldquo;Favorite&rdquo; (remember when Twitter called Likes this?) posts&mdash;but all that does is just interact with the person. There&rsquo;s no system that will feature Favorited posts in your feed. <em>Thank goodness.</em></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Mastodon privacy" class="wp-image-1410098" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5-privacy.png?w=1081" width="1081" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>You can add people you&rsquo;ve followed to Lists and then pin those lists to your &ldquo;Advanced Web View&rdquo; located in <em>Options -&gt; Appearance</em>&mdash;which is basically like Tweetdeck for Mastodon&mdash;and keep better track of different groups of people. You can also pin hashtags or groups of hashtags as searches to your view to follow those as well!</p>



<p>Heck, if you want to embed your Mastodon feed in your blog, you can do that with <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.mastofeed.com/&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Mastofeed</a> too.</p>



<p>These stark differences from Twitter make it clear how different Mastodon&rsquo;s goals are as a service. Which, for one, is to be a service instead of a platform.</p>



<h2 id="federated-service-versus-platform">Federated Service versus Platform</h2>



<p>I&rsquo;m going to keep referring to these social networking tools as &ldquo;services&rdquo; because they are just that: Services instead of platforms. This is one of the major paradigm differences between modern centralized social media and the direction things appear to be heading (which, again, is also where they came from)<em>.</em> Twitter is a platform; it&rsquo;s a singular, centralized hub run by a corporation that controls every aspect of it.</p>



<p>A service is a tool designed to solve a problem for the user (in this case, social networking), whereas a platform is a generic service that hosts other services for different target groups, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://rlohani.medium.com/function-vs-service-vs-platform-e2ac25445167#:~:text=A%20service%20is%20a%20business,do%20that%20by%20exposing%20API&amp;#039;s.&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">according to Paylocity CTO Rachit Lohani.</a></p>



<p>Twitter isn&rsquo;t a singular service. It has built itself into a business structure offering a variety of services to different groups&mdash;including other businesses. It&rsquo;s a social media site for the users, sure, but instead of earning revenue from its users in exchange for that service, it recoups costs <em>(even if unprofitably)</em> by selling data, ad slots, and other paid tools to businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nathan Reiff writes <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/120114/how-does-twitter-twtr-make-money.asp#:~:text=Twitter%20divides%20its%20revenue%20into,Facebook%20parent%20Meta%20Platforms%20Inc.&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">on Investopedia</a>: &ldquo;Twitter divides its revenue into two categories: the sale of advertising services, which constitutes the vast majority of the company&rsquo;s revenue, and data licensing and other services.&rdquo; Twitter doesn&rsquo;t even have a revenue category for &ldquo;providing a social media app to users,&rdquo; heh.</p>



<p>With Twitter, social networking isn&rsquo;t the product. The user is the product, with user acquisition being the goal. With Mastodon, the tool is the product.</p>



<p>Mastodon is a service. There&rsquo;s no centralized authority or hub: There are bigger, more &ldquo;official&rdquo;-like server instances for it, but anyone can host an instance for a community or niche, and are encouraged to, and whoever runs those instances governs their own community (including policies, code updates, and so on). It&rsquo;s all open-source software, which means community-based development, decision making, modification, and verification. There&rsquo;s also no advertising, data sharing, or tracking of any kind. Code development and individual community server hosting is funded by the community or the person funding it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Could a major company build their own Mastodon instance and charge users to join and provide some sort of proprietary or private offering to justify the cost? Absolutely. But that&rsquo;s not an inherent part of the service itself, and the vast majority of instances aren&rsquo;t set up that way.</p>



<h2 id="instances-and-decentralization">Instances and decentralization</h2>



<p>Alright so what the heck are these &ldquo;instances&rdquo; anyway? This is where things are going to <em>sound</em> complicated, but I promise they&rsquo;re simpler than they first seem.</p>



<p>First, let&rsquo;s cover federation.</p>



<p>Mastodon is just one example of a &ldquo;federated service.&rdquo; Federation means using a singular method of authenticating accounts across multiple different services, which can then all talk to each other and share things between each other. Microsoft uses this for <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techtarget.com%2Fsearchmobilecomputing%2Fdefinition%2FActive-Directory-Federation-Services-AD-Federation-Services&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=2-2-1404826-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Active Directory Federation Services</a>, as do plenty of other enterprise security systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.onelogin.com/learn/federated-identity&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">OneLogin explains</a> that the difference between federation and SSO (Single Sign-On) is that SSO is used for multiple applications from the same provider or domain, whereas federated identities can be used across multiple different applications, services, or platforms from different providers as long as those services are in the same &ldquo;federation&rdquo; enabled to talk to one another.</p>



<p>Simplified, it just means that a bunch of services are built upon the same account foundation to allow you to use the same accounts and communication protocols across each other, so they can all speak the same language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Mastodon and other &ldquo;Fediverse&rdquo; services, this foundation is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">ActivityPub</a>: An open, decentralized social networking protocol built by the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">World Wide Web Consortium</a>. Many of the popular federated services use ActivityPub as their protocol and thus can talk to each other. There&rsquo;s a comprehensive list of these services <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://fediverse.party/en/miscellaneous/&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="How federated services work" class="wp-image-1410105" height="482" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/6-activitypub.png" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>ActivityPub is basically a protocol for sending and receiving messages, but where anyone can host their own servers (or &ldquo;instances&rdquo;) as a point for the user to interact with the broader network.</p>
</figcaption></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">W3C</a></div>



<p>ActivityPub posts (or Mastodon posts, etc.) are effectively like RSS feeds. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://mstdn.social/@feditips/106426947777397848&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">You can even subscribe to Mastodon accounts via RSS</a>!</p>



<p>These services are also decentralized, meaning that the hosting, organization, and decision making for these services is divided up among localized &ldquo;offices,&rdquo; or in this case instances. Individual communities are using their own server hosting to host different community hubs&mdash;usually on a virtual private server, but some are having great success hosting instances on Raspberry Pis and Chromebooks, interestingly enough.</p>



<p>Federated services are nothing new. Humans use federation for many things. Post offices and libraries are good examples&mdash;places that operate as a sort of universal service but are run by different offices or organizations.</p>



<p>In Mastodon, there are the more &ldquo;official&rdquo; generic instances that you can sign up to, such as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://mastodon.social/explore&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">mastodon.social</a>, but there are <em>lots</em> of cool niche community instances such as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://techhub.social/explore&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">techhub.social</a> for techies, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://mastodon.art/explore&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">mastodon.art</a> for artists, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://writing.exchange/explore&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">writing.exchange</a> for writers, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://peoplemaking.games/explore&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">peoplemaking.games</a> for game developers, and the instance I&rsquo;m in, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://mindly.social/getting-started&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">mindly.social</a>. And then there&rsquo;s the shining example of the Internet Archive having their own organizational instance at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://mastodon.archive.org/about&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">mastodon.archive.org</a> with clear roles and identification of IA employees.</p>



<p>These are where things get confusing for many new Mastodon users, however. You <strong>do not</strong> need to sign up for each individual instance! You can if you want to maintain separate branding for different purposes, but most people do not need to do this. Each instance is equivalent to a dedicated forum or website in terms of focus and grouping of people, but they&rsquo;re all using the same communication protocol! That&rsquo;s the beauty of federated services. People from one instance can chat with, discover, and do anything else with people from other instances without much issue. Think of your Mastodon account like an email address&mdash;just because my &ldquo;email&rdquo; is @eposvox@glitch.lgbt doesn&rsquo;t mean I can&rsquo;t chat with @textfiles@mastodon.archive.org&mdash;it just means our accounts were created in different places.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Mastodon servers" class="wp-image-1410108" height="898" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/7-server_choice.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Choosing a server is the biggest point of friction for new users. There&rsquo;s nothing &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; about signing up &ndash; it&rsquo;s the same as every other website or app in steps and difficulty &ndash; but this step does act as a potential speedbump. Think of servers like clubhouses, chat rooms, or subreddits, you join them based on interests or convenience. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with joining a generic, big instance that lets you in and then moving to a smaller, more unique one as you learn and explore.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>You can also move your entire profile to another instance at any time, followers and all. Which is part of the resilience of the service, too. Your previous &ldquo;account&rdquo; then turns into a redirect to your new one. No worries if you already told everyone your previous address, the system has free mail forwarding!</p>



<p>All of this means that services like Mastodon are decentralized, governed and hosted by different groups of people in different places and not subject to any individual authority or goals, resilient by nature of being decentralized and interoperable, and they give power back to the user. You, the user, are in control of your own data. You can delete every ounce of it whenever you like, move it between instances if you don&rsquo;t like how the one you&rsquo;re in is being run, or host your own single-user or small community instance where you make the rules! You are not the product, which is hard to wrap your mind around when the net has conditioned us into accepting being the product for over a decade now.</p>



<p>Also, we just went through a load of decentralization talk, and didn&rsquo;t need to mention blockchain or crypto even once. Just saying.</p>



<h2 id="why-people-host-mastodon-instances">Why people host Mastodon instances</h2>



<p>I got a chance to speak with Joe &ldquo;KuJoe&rdquo; Dougherty, the operator of the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://mindly.social&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">mindly.social</a> Mastodon instance, about why he started hosting it in the first place, given it went up just a little before large crowds started coming over from Twitter. His story is similar to many who have started seeking out alternative homes for social networking.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Earlier this year I was feeling a real sense of dread using social media, it felt like a game that I could never win,&rdquo; Dougherty told me. &ldquo;I would spend a lot of my time on it looking for somebody to interact with but legitimate conversations were so few and far between because talking in replies doesn&rsquo;t get likes.&rdquo; As someone familiar with IT and server hosting, Dougherty was naturally curious about this new service and started researching it, getting hooked immediately.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Mindly Social" class="wp-image-1410103" height="1047" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/8-mindly.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Mindly.social is one of many Mastodon instances that started out simply as a small, fun place to hang out, but quickly exploded during Mastodon&rsquo;s influx of viewers in November.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>&ldquo;I was drawn to the tech, to the freedom from corporations, and to the social aspect of it all,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;After a bit more research I decided to start my own instance because I wanted to build a different kind of community than the existing instances while also putting my tech skills to work. It was a good feeling to offer other people a home on a new platform.&rdquo; Dougherty quit most other social media not long after, being all-in on Mastodon by October, and said the change immediately improved not just his mental health, but his productivity, too.</p>



<p>Then, of course, the Twitter fiasco exploded interest in Mastodon in general. Being one of the few instances available to these huge waves of new users&mdash;as many instances had to pause or close invites to balance the load and allocate more resources, etc.&mdash;mindly.social saw a huge growth in community members. &ldquo;November 7th we hit 100 users on our instance, then on November 8th we hit 5,000 users, then on November 10th we hit 10,000 users. 6 days later we&rsquo;re sitting at around 21,000 users.&rdquo;</p>



<p>For Dougherty, it&rsquo;s hardly about the numbers, though. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to have a home for so many people, most of whom proudly share that they are escaping the negativity of other social media platforms like I was,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In the past few weeks I&rsquo;ve had so many conversations with people just talking about random things, more than I&rsquo;d ever had in the 14 years I was on Twitter. I&rsquo;ve turned off notifications so I don&rsquo;t see when I get favorites or boosts and I&rsquo;m genuinely more happy as a result.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Probably the best part about this whole experience is every day it&rsquo;s different people,&rdquo; Dougherty said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t just find a group of 2-3 people that grouped up with and talk with every day. Every single day for the past 9 days I&rsquo;ve had meaningful interactions with new people, even if it&rsquo;s just me helping them get situated and we make little jokes while we work through it. Even outside of the conversations, every single day people are posting fantastic artwork, beautiful photos, inspirational quotes and poems, and just overall interesting stuff. Social media truly is much better when there&rsquo;s no algorithm to get in your way.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 id="kicking-it-old-school">Kicking it old school</h2>



<p>Again: The Internet <em>used to be this way</em> to begin with. Socializing online meant chatting on different BBS or forums hosted in different places by different groups of people, usually funded by that community. It meant staying up late using Pidgin or Trillian to keep track of AIM, MSN, and Yahoo instant messaging accounts to keep up with friends in different places. It meant having fansites running their own shows, and blogs spread out across Blogspot, Geocities, and so on&mdash;rather than everything being limited to Facebook groups and Twitter circles, where you&rsquo;re constantly fed ads, your data is harvested and sold, and the for-profit corporations running them are making decisions about how to extend profits rather than provide a great service.</p>



<p>But with all of this momentum towards federated and alternative services, and millions of users finally trying this stuff out, it all means we might actually be able to reclaim the Internet back for the users.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Spacehey" class="wp-image-1410095" height="1138" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/9-spacehey.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>While it&rsquo;s not a federated service connected to Mastodon, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://spacehey.com/&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">SpaceHey</a> is another great example of a small, alternative social networking website that&rsquo;s independently-run and happens to help harken back to the classic MySpace Nostalgia.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t find yourself enjoying Mastodon, that&rsquo;s okay! The goal of this &ldquo;shift&rdquo; is not to convert you over to another service to monopolize your time, but rather to get you to try out smaller services and communities that might be a better fit for you.&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s take a look at a few more while we&rsquo;re at it.</p>



<h2 id="pixelfed">PixelFed</h2>



<p>Another great Fediverse service is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://pixelfed.org/&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Pixelfed</a>, a Instagram clone with all the same priorities and subversion of Mastodon. You can share photos and images, you can like, comment, and re-share posts, use filters, add Stories <em>(sigh)</em>, build albums, DM users, and so on. There are also no ads, no data selling, and no algorithms. I still think a no-comments photo app like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://glass.photo/&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Glass</a> would be more akin to what I want as a &ldquo;pure&rdquo; art tool, but this is awesome.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since it&rsquo;s federated, you can view, follow, and interact with PixelFed posts and accounts with your existing Mastodon account! Creating posts <em>does</em> require you to make a new, PixelFed-specific account, which is a point of confusion for users. But then your PixelFed feed becomes its own federated profile that you can, for example, follow on Mastodon to easily boost and share your PixelFed posts to your existing Mastodon followers.</p>



<h2 id="peertube">PeerTube</h2>



<p>If you want to host videos, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://joinpeertube.org/&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">PeerTube</a> is a great service for building that. It&rsquo;s decentralized, open source, and uses ActivityPub for federation&mdash;meaning that instead of just building one massive and direct &ldquo;YouTube competitor&rdquo; (which has historically not been a successful venture: See VidMe, Vessel, etc.), individual communities or organizations can host their own video websites for specific topics or communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A great example of this is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://tilvids.com/&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">TILvids</a>, a video site ran on PeerTube that&rsquo;s dedicated to edutainment videos (hence the &ldquo;Today I Learned&rdquo; acronym in the title).</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="TILVIDS" class="wp-image-1410109" height="738" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/10-tilvids.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>This has many advantages, including lower and more spread-out costs by not putting the bulk of it on any individual or singular organization, easier discoverability by having specialized sites for individual niches or communities, and control for organizations or groups who want to host their own content without being restricted in rules by a higher authority. Plus, all the usual advantages of decentralization and federation described above.</p>



<p>PeerTube uses the Bittorrent peer-to-peer protocol for streaming video to help reduce bandwidth costs and load, too.</p>



<h2 id="owncast">Owncast</h2>



<p>Beyond just on-demand videos, you can use <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://owncast.online/&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Owncast</a> for hosting your own live streaming service with control over how things are run, no ads (unless you integrate them), chat with chat bots, and compatibility with most streaming software. For streamers wanting to reduce their dependence on a specific streaming platform, running Owncast is a great way to give viewers somewhere else to support you without missing any of the action.</p>



<h2 id="writefreely">WriteFreely</h2>



<p>For long-form writers, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://writefreely.org/&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">WriteFreely</a> is a minimal, Markdown-based blogging service that can be as private or public as you want, with intense customization options. You can craft private personal journals or publish blogs with monetization, complete with (optional) comments and federation to other ActivityPub-enabled services as well. You can also set up your own blog on existing WriteFreely community servers like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://write.as&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Write.as</a> or easily host your own! Better yet, it&rsquo;s easy to run.</p>



<h2 id="tumblr">Tumblr?</h2>



<p>Believe it or not, blogging platform <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tumblr.com/&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tumblr</a> is on the rise again after being sold to Automattic (WordPress&rsquo; parent company) <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/13/tumblr-once-sold-billion-owner-wordpress-just-bought-site-fraction-that/&amp;xcust=2-2-1404826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">in 2019</a>.

<p>Regardless of what direction Twitter goes in, it seems the social networking landscape on the Internet is changing, potentially for the better&mdash;starting with just having services that are &ldquo;social networking&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;social media&rdquo; to begin with.</p>



<p>You don&rsquo;t need to make drastic moves or jump ship from any services right now, but familiarizing yourself with these decentralized options will only benefit you as things move forward. We can all benefit from a paradigm shift back away from users being the product, and towards gaining control over our online experiences. The internet used to be a fun place full of clubhouses run by people with varying interests, but more recently it&rsquo;s just been big, monolithic office buildings run by corporations and billionaires. Let&rsquo;s take the internet back and make the net weird again.</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Working from home has gone from being a growing trend to a full-scale phenomenon: One recent Gallup poll <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/355907/remote-work-persisting-trending-permanent.aspx&amp;xcust=2-2-1389780-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">found 1 in 4 full-time U.S. employees works entirely from a home office</a>. There are many perks to a work-from-home arrangement, to be sure, but there can also be downsides: For example, there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ll need to supply your own monitor. Fortunately, there are many great home office monitors to choose from, and the most affordable models start at just $100.</p>



<p>Below you&rsquo;ll find our picks for the best home office monitors, and below that you can learn more about what specs and features matter when shopping for a home office monitor.</p>

<p>The Dell U3223QE is an exceptional home office monitor that will serve you well for a decade (or more).</p>

<p>This 4K, 32-inch monitor has superb image quality thanks to its cutting-edge IPS Black panel. This new panel type has roughly double the contrast ratio of a typical IPS panel, delivering a richer, deeper image. It&rsquo;s also an extremely bright monitor with a maximum brightness of over 450 nits. Color performance is also top-notch with precise color accuracy and a wide color gamut spanning 99 percent of the DCI-P3 color space.</p>

<p>Home office owners will be equally impressed by its connectivity. This monitor has USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and up to 95 watts of Power Delivery for charging a connected device. When connected over USB-C, the monitor acts as a feature-rich hub with not only USB-A ports but also ethernet and DisplayPort-out. This monitor can replace a USB-C hub or dock on your desk.</p>

<p>The monitor&rsquo;s ergonomics are great, too. It has significant adjustment for height, tilt, swivel, and can even rotate 90 degrees for portrait use&mdash;an uncommon feature for a monitor this large.</p>

<p>If the Dell U3223QE is too large, or expensive, consider its smaller sibling: <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8200811-12839518?url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-27-4k-usb-c-hub-monitor-u2723qe/apd/210-bdpf/monitors-monitor-accessories&amp;sid=2-2-1389780-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">the Dell U2723QE</a>. This 27-inch 4K monitor has the same features and retails for a couple hundred dollars less.</p>

<p>NZXT&rsquo;s Canvas 27Q is a great mid-range home office monitor and the best value pick on this list. It&rsquo;s a smart choice if you want attractive image quality without spending a fortune. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Canvas 27Q is a 27-inch monitor with 1440p resolution, which provides a nice boost in clarity over 1080p. This is a bright monitor, reaching nearly 380 nits at maximum brightness. It&rsquo;s also color accurate and supports up to 97 percent of the DCI-P3 color space.</p>

<p>This monitor has a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode. The USB-C port acts as a hub for two USB-A ports. Unlike most monitors, this one doesn&rsquo;t come with a stand: The stand is a $40 add-on. It&rsquo;s a great stand, though, with height, tilt, and swivel adjustment, and a sturdy feel. A $100 monitor arm is also available.</p>

<p>Want to fire up a game after work? The Canvas 27Q has you covered. It has a maximum refresh rate of 165Hz and supports both AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync for smooth motion in games.</p>

<p>The Canvas 27Q has an MSRP of $339.99 but is often discounted to $249.99. The $40 stand brings the total price to $289.99. That&rsquo;s excellent value given the monitor&rsquo;s image quality and many features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Want a basic home office monitor that can handle most tasks at a very low price? The Acer K242HYL is it.</p>

<p>Acer&rsquo;s K242HYL is a 24-inch, 1080p monitor. It&rsquo;s not as sharp as a premium, 4K monitor, but image clarity is not bad for a monitor in this price bracket. The K242HYL also packs a respectable maximum brightness of almost 300 nits, good color accuracy, and supports 98 percent of the sRGB gamut. None of these figures are record breaking, but they&rsquo;re great for a budget monitor.</p>

<p>The monitor lacks a height-adjustable stands, but this is common at this price. A VESA monitor stand mount is available for adding a third-party monitor stand. &nbsp;Video connectivity is limited to just one HDMI and one VGA. The monitor does throw in a few perks, though, including AMD FreeSync support for smooth gaming and a slightly enhanced 75Hz refresh rate.</p>

<p>Often priced at just $99.99, the Acer K242HYL is an impressive value. It&rsquo;s the least capable monitor on this list, to be sure&mdash;but it&rsquo;s more than adequate for document editing, accounting, project management, video conferencing, and hundreds of other home office tasks.</p>

<p>Asus&rsquo; ProArt PA279CV is a great home office monitor that delivers many perks of our top pick, the Dell U3223QE, at a lower price.</p>

<p>The ProArt PA279CV is a 27-inch 4K monitor with excellent image clarity. It also has a superb maximum brightness of over 400 nits and very accurate color. It has a narrower color gamut than the NZXT Canvas 27Q, but does span the entire sRGB color space, which is more than enough for home office use.</p>

<p>This monitor has a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 65 watts of Power Delivery for charging a connected device. The USB-C port acts as a hub for four additional USB-A ports. A sturdy ergonomic stand with height, swivel, and tilt adjustment will help you find a comfortable viewing position.</p>

<p>This monitor is frequently on sale for about $449.99, which is good value for a 4K monitor with USB-C. The Asus ProArt PA279CV is an attractive way to pick up the benefits of a premium 4K monitor at a mid-range price.</p>

<p>Concerned about the ecological impact of your home office? You should be. Global E-waste <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.statista.com/topics/3409/electronic-waste-worldwide/#editorsPicks&amp;xcust=2-2-1389780-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">is currently estimated at 53.6 megatons per year</a> and, of course, it&rsquo;s growing. Acer&rsquo;s Vero BR277 isn&rsquo;t going to solve this problem on its own&mdash;but it tries.</p>

<p>The Acer Vero BR277, like other Acer Vero products, is partially built from Post-Consumer Recycled Plastics. Despite what you may think, these plastics feel robust. They also have a unique flecked look that stands out from other, less visually interesting designs.</p>

<p>How the monitor is built wouldn&rsquo;t matter if it was junk&mdash;thankfully, it&rsquo;s quite good. This is a 27-inch 1080p monitor with a respectable maximum brightness of just over 300 nits. The monitor&rsquo;s color gamut is a bit limited at just 97 precent of sRGB, but it scores well in color accuracy and contrast. The result? Bright, pleasant, realistic image quality.</p>

<p>The monitor has an ergonomic stand that adjusts for height, swivel, and tilt. It also supports AMD FreeSync for smooth gaming and has a maximum refresh of 75Hz.</p>

<p>Pricing is competitive. The monitor originally released at an MSRP of $249.99 but can now be found as low as $169.99. That&rsquo;s a great price for a home office monitor with good image quality and a height-adjustable stand. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XR9GKFJ?ots=1&amp;tag=pcworld02-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Farticle%2F791232%2Facer-vero-br277-monitor-review.html">Acer also has a 24-inch model</a>, which is even less expensive at $129.99.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-home-office-monitor">What to look for in a home office monitor</h2>



<p>A great home office monitor should have a high maximum brightness, great image clarity, and vivid color. A height adjustable stand is preferable, as it helps with ergonomics, and a wide range of connectivity is useful for connecting multiple devices.</p>



<h3 id="resolution-matters-but-1080p-is-still-fine">Resolution matters, but 1080p is still fine</h3>



<p>4K is the best resolution in most situations, as it provides a sharper image and can make small fonts easier to read. This remains a premium option, however: Most 4K monitors are still above $300. A 27-inch 4K monitor has a pixel density of 163 pixels per inch.</p>



<p>The less well-known 1440p resolution (2560&times;1440) is a good option for mid-range monitors. It&rsquo;s not quite as sharp as 4K, but it&rsquo;s a noticeable upgrade over 1080p. A 27-inch 1440p monitor has a pixel density of 108 pixels per inch.</p>



<p>1080p resolution remains a good pick for budget monitors. It&rsquo;s not nearly as sharp as 4K, so video may look a bit soft and small fonts may be harder to read, but it&rsquo;s still adequate for hundreds of home office tasks. A 27-inch 1080p monitor has a pixel density of 81 pixels per inch.</p>



<h3 id="when-it-comes-to-brightness-more-is-more">When it comes to brightness, more is more</h3>



<p>Brightness is a key trait for a home office monitor.</p>



<p>An office monitor doesn&rsquo;t need to be bright to look usable: 200 nits is fine. However, a home office is likely to be brighter and to have less light control than a corporate cubical. A maximum brightness of 300 nits, or better, is ideal. You can always turn the brightness down from its maximum if it looks too bright but, of course, the reverse isn&rsquo;t true.</p>



<h3 id="make-sure-you-understand-connectivity">Make sure you understand connectivity</h3>



<p>It&rsquo;s important to buy a monitor that supports a video output found on your PC. Most desktop computers will offer both DisplayPort and HDMI, while laptops often stick to HDMI. Budget home monitors sometimes support older connections, such as VGA and DVI, but these are not found on new computers. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/512092/pcworld_giant_display_cable_guide.html">Our guide to display cables</a> can help you identify the ports on your PC.</p>



<p>You only need one video connection between your PC and your home office monitor, and the type of connection you use isn&rsquo;t terribly important. HDMI and DisplayPort work equally well for home office use.</p>



<h3 id="usb-c-isnt-a-must-have-but-its-useful">USB-C isn&rsquo;t a must-have, but it&rsquo;s useful</h3>



<p>USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode is a new alternative to HDMI and DisplayPort. It bundles a DisplayPort connection into the familiar USB-C port now used by many devices (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341415/europe-sets-deadline-for-usb-c-charging-for-almost-all-laptops.html">and soon to be required by law in Europe</a>).</p>



<p>Some high-end laptops, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/825567/dell-xps-13-plus-9320-review.html">like the Dell XPS 13 Plus</a>, only support video output over USB-C. You can still connect a DisplayPort monitor with a USB-C to DisplayPort cable adapter, but this is a clunky solution.</p>



<p>USB-C, unlike HDMI and DisplayPort, can support Power Delivery to charge a connected device. This is useful for thin-and-light laptops, as it makes docking the laptop easier. Some USB-C monitors, like the Dell U3223QE, have built-in USB-C hubs that connect to multiple USB-A ports, ethernet, and DisplayPort-out. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/612470/you-should-buy-a-usb-c-hub-monitor-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html">Our guide to USB-C hub monitors</a> has the full scoop on these perks.</p>



<h2 id="how-we-test-monitors">How we test monitors</h2>



<p>PCWorld&rsquo;s monitor reviews rely on in-depth testing by a team of staff and freelance writers. Our experts spend hundreds of hours testing and comparing monitors to find the best choice for any budget.</p>



<p>We test monitors with a SpyderXElite color calibration tool. This provides objective measurements for brightness, contrast, color accuracy, color temperature, gamma, and color gamut, among other metrics. These objective metrics help us compare dozens of monitors at once and eliminate bias from comparisons.</p>
