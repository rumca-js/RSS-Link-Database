He also has a convenient excuse, or so he claims: there is someone else to blame. At the Spain camp, where the players set off for training pitch No 3 by scooter each morning, they have organised a predictions league for the tournament. On the eve of the <em>selecci\u00f3n</em>\u2019s third game \u2013 and, no, no one went for 7-0 against Costa Rica \u2013 leading the way is Fernando Giner, the team delegate. Top of the players is Gavi. The Manchester City defender is down at the bottom.</p><p>\u201cNot great,\u201d he says, then quick as a flash he adds: \u201cBut the thing is, I\u2019m not doing it myself. Someone\u2019s doing it for me.\u201d Who? \u201cI can\u2019t say.\u201d Laporte cracks up. Betting is not really his thing, he says, and nor it turns out is football. He loves playing, but this is different. In the TV room, five or six players gather for every game; he isn\u2019t often one of them. \u201cI\u2019m not a football addict. Honestly, I don\u2019t like watching matches,\u201d he admits. He\u2019s seen enough, though, to know one thing: there isn\u2019t a team better than Spain.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/30/aymeric-laporte-spain-world-cup-not-football-addict\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/30/gareth-southgate-england-trust-confidence-qatar-world-cup", "title": "Gareth Southgate and England thrive on trust and confidence in Qatar", "date_published": "2022-11-30 22:30:29+00:00", "description": "<p>Fans stuck by England after another tame start, and patience on and off the pitch proved key to their eventually stylish progress</p><p>In a parallel universe \u2013 say at Wembley or Molineux \u2013 Harry Maguire rumbles forward and keeps on going to the fringes of the penalty area.

Like the developer\u2019s other titles (the Dark Souls series and Bloodborne, for instance), this complex game tells its story through short snippets of dialogue rather than long cinematic cutscenes, and via objects in the world, rather than endless scrolls, audio messages or emails. The player has to do most of the work in assembling a cogent narrative, which suited me fine, because, through the 200-hours I\u2019ve spent with the game, I simply do not care about the plot \u2013 I have my own. I wander the dangerous lands of Caelid and Dragonbarrow as an existential assassin, like Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter or Mad Max, not bothering to try and make sense of the world, just keen to explore and fight and survive. I like this story better \u2013 especially when my son joins me and we take on foes together, revelling in the story that builds of is own accord as we play.</p><p>There have always been titles that have allowed a lot of what we call player agency: the ability to do what you like, to some degree, in a digital environment.

Then came the open-world genre, ushered in by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/grand-theft-auto\">Grand Theft Auto 3</a>, and games were for ever altered as story-delivery mechanisms. Yet traditional notions of narrative form and structure still pervade. From The Witcher 3 and Horizon Zero Dawn to Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, if you want a story experience, you need to do the story missions, you need to interact with computer-controlled story agents, you need to cede agency to the story god. I\u2019m sort of done with that now, and maybe I\u2019m not alone.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/nov/30/pushing-buttons-how-video-games-lost-the-plot\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/nov/30/rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-pmqs-latest-live-news-uk-politics", "title": "Sunak to take PMQs as survey suggests Tory members see him as one of worst-performing cabinet ministers \u2013 UK politics live", "date_published": "2022-11-30 11:21:23+00:00", "description": "<p>Survey of Conservative party members shows PM is sixth from bottom in table of how cabinet ministers are seen to be performing</p><p>England\u2019s poorest students will be more than \u00a31,000 worse off this academic year than the last, according to a <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/news/cost-living-crisis-hit-students-harder-expected\">new analysis</a> that warns of \u201csignificant hardship for many this winter\u201d.
