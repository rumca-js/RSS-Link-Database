## Aymeric Laporte: ‘I’m not a football addict. I don’t like watching matches’

<p>The defender discusses Spain’s World Cup ambitions, being better at table tennis than predictions and helping Rodri at centre-half </p><p>Aymeric Laporte is having a terrible World Cup, but he doesn’t care. He also has a convenient excuse, or so he claims: there is someone else to blame. At the Spain camp, where the players set off for training pitch No 3 by scooter each morning, they have organised a predictions league for the tournament. On the eve of the <em>selección</em>’s third game – and, no, no one went for 7-0 against Costa Rica – leading the way is Fernando Giner, the team delegate. Top of the players is Gavi. The Manchester City defender is down at the bottom.</p><p>“Not great,” he says, then quick as a flash he adds: “But the thing is, I’m not doing it myself. Someone’s doing it for me.” Who? “I can’t say.” Laporte cracks up. Betting is not really his thing, he says, and nor it turns out is football. He loves playing, but this is different. In the TV room, five or six players gather for every game; he isn’t often one of them. “I’m not a football addict. Honestly, I don’t like watching matches,” he admits. He’s seen enough, though, to know one thing: there isn’t a team better than Spain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/30/aymeric-laporte-spain-world-cup-not-football-addict">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Elizabeth Banks-directed caper, based on a true story, looks to be exactly what the internet wants it to be</p><p>Ever since it was first announced back in April, Cocaine Bear has held a very special place in the heart of moviegoers. A film based on the real life story of a 175lb black bear who ingested a duffel bag of abandoned cocaine in northern Georgia in 1985, Cocaine Bear seemed to have everything that a discerning modern audience would want in a film, which is to say a bear and some cocaine.</p><p>That said, there was also a sense that the film couldn’t possibly live up to the title. Cocaine Bear is such a perfect name for a movie that any attempt to flesh it out with actual content could easily be a disappointment. After all, the concept of a bear mashed off its face on cocaine is a lot more fun than the reality of a bear mashed off its face on cocaine. Let’s not forget that, in 1985, a medical examiner determined that the bear had suffered from brain haemorrhaging and failure of the kidney, heart and lungs, which meant that it most likely died terrified and in incredible pain. Which by all accounts would make for a monumental bummer of a film.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/30/cocaine-bear-trailer-2023-wildest-film-everything-and-more">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘When this picture of the senator at Joe Biden’s inauguration went viral, someone actually sent me a pair of these gloves.

I work for Agence France-Presse, one of the bigger wire services in the world. There’s basically three left these days and we’re all competing. We hardwire our cameras to the internet so we can transmit images directly. When I saw Senator Sanders come in, I took a couple of pictures and decided which to send.</p><p>This is a very typical Bernie Sanders moment: sitting down and minding his own business. Officially an independent, he talks to who he needs to talk to, but he doesn’t run around schmoozing. His outfit was either perfectly planned, or it wasn’t planned at all. It was cold, it’s not super stylish, but it does the job.

Of course they were out of order</p><p><br /></p><p>There are few sights so dispiriting as the back end of a queue poking out of a post office. Nobody pays a leisurely visit to a post office: there is always somewhere else you need to be and something else you should be doing. And there is always a queue. Still, on a Saturday morning, finding myself in a small town in Sussex with something boring but urgent to post, I was just relieved to find the place open. For the entertainment of oblivious shoppers in the square outside, a bloke crooned carols accompanied by a fuzzy backing tape. And someone joined the queue behind me, so I was no longer last in line. Things could have been worse.</p><p>With glacial slowness, we edged forward. Why, in the crooning of another couple of carols, I had made real progress, crossing the threshold into the building. My mood continued to lighten. But then I saw them: two great big red self-service machines that presumably, thanks to the march of what we call progress, could, after a lot of stabbing at a touchscreen, weigh, stamp and dispatch whatever goods we had come bearing this winter’s morning.</p><p>Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist</p><p><br /><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I did not foresee having to sort out the love life of macho vampiric superhero, Blade. I didn’t expect to be joining a book club with Captain Marvel (first read: Sun Tzu’s Art of War). At no point while the game was installing did I envisage going on a bird-watching trip with Doctor Strange.</p><p>Yet all these unlikely scenarios are very much a part of this latest Marvel video game spinoff, which takes as many of its design cues from the fantasy role-playing series Fire Emblem as it does from XCOM. Here, players take on the role of a new hero character, Hunter, a 300-year-old sorceress reanimated by a re-imagining of a character from the Ghost Rider comics, to battle an evil witch bent on galactic domination. That witch also happens to be Hunter’s mother – and she’s recruited a whole army of Hydra goons to help out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/nov/30/marvel-midnight-suns-review-superheroes-nintendo-switch-pc-playstation-4-5-xbox-firaxis2k">Continue reading...</a>

This means Muslims and Hindus have made up some ground for religion, as such. In one sense, the picture that emerges from this census is improving.

According to Opinium research, more of us regard our society as being <a href="https://diversityuk.org/brits-more-tolerant-multicultural-britain/">more tolerant</a> now than it used to be.

<p>From Doris Lessing’s frank memoirs of social change to less famous campaigners in decisive struggles, these accounts provide an inspiring look ‘into the window’ of history</p><p>I spent my 1950s adolescence at a Methodist school in east Yorkshire, longing to be somewhere else.

<p>The players not the plot do most of the work in Elden Ring and other innovative titles – it could be the future of video games</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/nov/24/sign-up-for-pushing-buttons-keza-macdonalds-weekly-look-at-the-world-of-gaming">Don’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? Sign up here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Recently some members of the video-game community were enraged by news that FromSoftware’s oblique <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/mar/02/elden-ring-beginners-guide-open-world-adventure">open-world adventure Elden Ring</a> has been nominated in the best narrative category at the forthcoming Game Awards. Like the developer’s other titles (the Dark Souls series and Bloodborne, for instance), this complex game tells its story through short snippets of dialogue rather than long cinematic cutscenes, and via objects in the world, rather than endless scrolls, audio messages or emails. The player has to do most of the work in assembling a cogent narrative, which suited me fine, because, through the 200-hours I’ve spent with the game, I simply do not care about the plot – I have my own. I wander the dangerous lands of Caelid and Dragonbarrow as an existential assassin, like Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter or Mad Max, not bothering to try and make sense of the world, just keen to explore and fight and survive. I like this story better – especially when my son joins me and we take on foes together, revelling in the story that builds of is own accord as we play.</p><p>There have always been titles that have allowed a lot of what we call player agency: the ability to do what you like, to some degree, in a digital environment.

Then came the open-world genre, ushered in by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto 3</a>, and games were for ever altered as story-delivery mechanisms. Yet traditional notions of narrative form and structure still pervade. From The Witcher 3 and Horizon Zero Dawn to Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, if you want a story experience, you need to do the story missions, you need to interact with computer-controlled story agents, you need to cede agency to the story god. I’m sort of done with that now, and maybe I’m not alone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/nov/30/pushing-buttons-how-video-games-lost-the-plot">Continue reading...</a>

This arresting film is about a vivid process of reconstruction, or recontextualisation, like finding a fragment of an Etruscan pot in the soil and imagining what the whole pot looked like, what the society that produced it looked like, and what the violence that destroyed it looked like.</p><p>It is based on the book Three Minutes in Poland: Discovering a Lost World in a 1938 Family Film by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmXe7ojLvs4&amp;ab_channel=TaubeCenterforJewishLife%26Learning">American memoirist and author Glenn Kurtz</a>. In 2009, he had chanced upon a home movie shot by his grandfather David, who had come as a child from Poland to the US and made a prosperous life for himself there. The film recorded the family’s European vacation in 1938 and included a remarkable three-minute segment shot in his hometown of Nasielsk in eastern Poland, the first time that little place had ever been recorded on film. The movie vividly captures the Jewish inhabitants’ innocent bustling happiness at that moment, just months before they were deported to the ghettos by the invading Nazis and from there to be murdered in Treblinka.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/30/three-minutes-a-lengthening-review-fragments-of-a-jewish-town-destroyed-by-war">Continue reading...</a>

Since then, huge advances have been made in our understanding of the disease’s causes.

This morning, the results of a long-awaited trial of a promising new drug, lecanemab, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It could have beneficial effects for Alzheimer’s sufferers, although there are some caveats.</p><p>Dementia is defined as an acquired, progressive cognitive impairment that interferes with a person’s normal activities. In the UK, it affects more than 900,000 people and is the leading cause of death. Alzheimer’s Research UK puts the cost of caring for people with dementia at more than £25bn a year.

<p>Some clever ideas are wasted in this wobbly drama as a group of friends discover a dead body in nearby woodland</p><p>A gender-switched riff on Stand By Me sounds like an intriguing idea – a dead body is discovered by four pre-teen girls – and interesting things do happen in this film at first, in that it declines to conform tonally to what you expect; and yet the quirky-dreamy YA style persists. However, there is something uncertain and soft-centre about what follows, and the plot unrealities make it very silly.</p><p>Lola (Sanai Victoria), Mari (Eden Grace Redfield), Daisy (Madalen Mills) and Daisy (Lia Barnett) are four best friends in an American suburb, whiling away the long hot summer before they start middle school. Rambling aimlessly through some woodland outside town, they are stunned to discover the corpse of a man, and find themselves mostly reluctant to tell the police or their parents: they want to savour this bizarre, rare secret and also realise that once the alarm is raised, they will be fiercely questioned and feel like they are in trouble even though they aren’t.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/30/summering-review-gender-swapped-stand-by-me-in-the-quirky-dreamy-ya-style">Continue reading...</a>

When Vitti ultimately stood up for himself, the 7ft player literally punched down and dropped the smaller man to the floor. As Vitti struggled for air, O’Neal’s enablers scrambled to shroud the incident from Lakers higher-ups.</p><p>Believe it or not, this anecdote is played for <em>laughs</em>; even O’Neal and Vitti giggle about it now.

<p>The nushu system, still practised in China, reveals a long history of women’s frustrations and the solace this art provides</p><p>Nushu is a traditional secret writing system used by women in Jiangyong county in China’s Hunan province: slender, diamond-shaped characters they used to vent their frustrations and record their inner lives. This haunting but slyly subversive documentary about three present-day nushu specialists uses the practice to examine women’s changing roles in a China modernising at breakneck speed – though the forces of resistance are evident in the numerous episodes of impressive mansplaining surrounding this female preserve.</p><p>A prize-winning nushu expert working at a Jiangyoung museum, Hu Xin frets about how the essence of the art is being watered down in dance-based presentations demanded by tourists.

## No, it's not too early for a Christmas tree. Mine has been up for ages | Arwa Mahdawi

<p>When the world is going to hell, you reach for the familiar and the comforting. Even if it leaves you covered in needles</p><p>What is the optimal date to buy a Christmas tree? The Arwa-Mahdawi-approved answer is 26 November, which is when I bought mine. There was a time when I would have been aghast at anyone buying a Christmas tree in November. That was when I didn’t have a small child and the world didn’t seem to be on the brink of disaster. Now, however, I am a parent and the world has gone to hell so I seek comfort and security anywhere I can.</p><p>And you know what? Christmas trees are very comforting. They’re a calming constant in a world of rapid change. Christmas trees are the same every single year. They smell the same, they look the same, they act the same. They don’t get software updates … hang on, has some Silicon Valley bastard invented a “smart” Christmas tree? I bet they have. Wait a sec while I Google this. Oh my God, they have. <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/best-smart-christmas-trees/">Of course they have</a>. That’s not very Christmassy of them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/30/no-its-not-too-early-for-a-christmas-tree-mine-has-been-up-for-ages">Continue reading...</a>

I vaguely knew my parents and two siblings lived there at some point, and I grew up surrounded by minor monuments to that life in England: Dad’s records, the faux-Victorian framed mirror above the fireplace, and – Mum’s holy grail – a bedside Teasmade with an integrated lamp and clock. And I was fascinated by the pictures of my two older siblings hosting a birthday party, making a snowman, and posing in front of Buckingham Palace in our family albums. They seemed so removed from my reality of growing up in a small town in Kenya’s Rift Valley. I promised myself that I would one day visit Coulsdon, in the London borough of Croydon, then outgrew my fascination.</p><p>In 1981, my father had left Kenya to study psychiatry<strong> </strong>in the UK, and, one year later, my mother, brother and sister had joined him. As a resident doctor on rotation, he worked in many hospitals, including Cane Hill in Coulsdon, while my mother made a busy life for herself, often rushing from typist training to pick up my siblings from school in her beloved sky-blue Mini Cooper.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/30/a-moment-that-changed-me-born-and-raised-in-kenya-i-yearned-for-croydon">Continue reading...</a>

Colbert, who for two years has refused to say the former president’s name on The Late Show, confessed to not watching Trump’s speech – “I pay some sucker to do that for me,” he quipped – but nevertheless devoted the bulk of his monologue to what he called “2016 all over again”. “I get it, but you’re going to want to pace yourself,” he told his booing audience. “Those boos need to last for two years.”</p><p>It was a typically conflicted performance from a host who has often served as the mean for late-night comedians’ response to Donald Trump’s presence in American politics. It was Colbert who, on election night 2016, openly mourned Trump’s victory on live television and prefaced the identity crisis to come for late-night talk shows: “I’m not sure it’s a comedy show any more.” For four years, nightly comedy shows – Colbert’s Late Show, Late Night with Seth Meyers, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, Jimmy Fallon’s Tonight Show and Jimmy Kimmel Live! – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/29/late-night-comedy-trump-era-colbert-snl-daily-show">cycled through a deadening Trump feedback loop</a>.

But it’s not about watching Mbappé per se, it’s about watching him <em>now</em>, when he looks in the form and the mood to do something career-defining, something we’ll still be talking about when we’re old.

<p>China has been rocked by an outpouring of communal anger at the government’s restrictive ‘zero Covid’ lockdown policies. Could the protests develop into something more substantial? Tania Branigan reports</p><p>The largest protests in a generation have erupted in cities across China against the government’s harsh Covid restrictions and also, in some cases, the president himself, Xi Jinping. The most widely used symbol in the demonstrations has been a blank sheet of paper, symbolising the censorship all those within China face.</p><p>The Guardian’s <strong>Tania Branigan </strong>tells <strong>Michael Safi </strong>that while this may not be a revolutionary moment in China, it is hugely significant. China has struck out alone in attempting to keep Covid cases to an absolute minimum, regardless of the restrictions needed. But what has surprised many onlookers is the fact that the authorities have not used the time to implement a widescale vaccine policy that could help the country get back to normality. Instead, China appears caught in a trap of its own devising – and there is no easy route out of it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/nov/30/how-far-could-china-zero-covid-protests-go-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
