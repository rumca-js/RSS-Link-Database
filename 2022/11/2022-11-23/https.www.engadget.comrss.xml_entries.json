As <em>The Verge</em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/23/23474969/mercedes-car-subscription-faster-acceleration-feature-price\">observes</a>, Mercedes has <a href=\"https://shop.mbusa.com/en-us/connect/pdp/Acceleration-Increase/709\">introduced</a> a $1,200 per year \"Acceleration Increase\" subscription that improves the performance of the EQE and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqs-ev-review-video-150001883.html\">EQS</a> in their standard sedan and SUV variants. Pay the annual fee and your 0-60MPH time will improve by 0.8 to 1 seconds thanks to a higher peak motor output and increased torque.</p><p>Mercedes is quick to explain that this is strictly a software change. In other words, you're paying to get performance your car could already handle. While you're still getting more value than BMW's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bmw-heated-seats-subscription-uk-south-korea-connected-drive-060140639.html\">$18 per month heated seats</a>, it's an odd move when these cars are already expensive and have speedier models that only require a one-time outlay. Why buy an EQS 450 with the acceleration add-on when an EQS 580 will be faster and include more creature comforts in the bargain?</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The German automaker isn't the first to charge extra for added performance. Tesla has long asked customers to shell out for its most advanced driver assists. For a while, it also charged entry Model S buyers a premium to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-18-tesla-kills-model-s-60-60d.html\">unlock battery capacity</a>. And if you're more inclined toward motorcycles, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/zero-motorcycles-2022-sr-annoucement-181805528.html\">Zero asks nearly $1,800</a> to maximize the power of the 2022 SR. The difference, of course, is that those are still one-off purchases where Mercedes wants you to keep paying for the life of the car.</p><p>The business strategy is clear. As with the tech world's general shift <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-365-available-worldwide-164731336.html\">toward subscription services</a>, Mercedes is hoping for a steady stream of revenue from customers who might otherwise spend little beyond the initial purchase. Acceleration Increase is decidedly more lucrative than periodic navigation updates and maintenance.

From Sony's perspective, one of the key sticking points of the Activision merger is the possibility that Microsoft will make the Call of Duty franchise (said to be <a href=\"https://www.tweaktown.com/news/84131/sony-to-lose-260-million-year-if-call-of-duty-goes-xbox-exclusive/index.html\"><ins>worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year</ins></a> to PlayStation) exclusive to Xbox. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/21/technology/microsoft-activision-deal.html\"><ins>Microsoft said</ins></a> it offered Sony a 10-year deal to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation earlier this month.

Mobile \"is a place where if we don\u2019t gain relevancy as a gaming brand, over time the business will become untenable,\" Spencer said. (Xbox Cloud Gaming runs on phones and tablets as well.)</p><p>Microsoft doubled down on the mobile side of the deal in its CMA filing. \"As it stands, Xbox has no material presence in mobile and its ability to reach gamers on mobile is impeded by Apple and Google\u2019s effective duopoly in the provision of mobile app stores.

The computationally intensive process adds to the load on the electrical grid, and has even prompted some mining outfits in New York to build natural gas-based power plants to sustain their operations. The cryptocurrency world has sometimes tried to minimize the impact.

These popular wireless earbuds have been high on many wish lists since they first debuted in 2016. We're now on the third-generation of Apple's standard earbuds, and the second full revamp of the higher-end AirPods Pro. And those who want all of the conveniences of AirPods in a classic, over-ear design can still turn to Apple's AirPods Max. Regardless of which model you're looking to gift (or buy for yourself), there are discounts to be had for Black Friday.

While that's not a huge discount, it's significant for a pair of Apple earbuds that just came out a couple of months ago. These buds earned a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218.html\">score of 88</a> from us for their improved sound quality, excellent Transparency Mode and solid active noise cancellation.

Working from home has its perks \u2013 not having a commute being chief among them \u2013 but it\u2019s not without challenges. Household disturbances are big ones, as well as poor lighting or simply the lack of professional-level equipment that they might have access to only in-office.

Each side corresponds to different lengths of time; to start the timer, you\u2019ll flip the cube so your desired time faces upwards. Flipping the LCD display upwards again will pause it, while turning the display downwards will stop the timer.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>There are a number of ways to use them, but I like using the Pomodoro Technique with these. I\u2019ll enable the 30 minute timer which then encourages me to focus just on my work for the allotted time period. Once time is up, I give myself a five minute rest, and then I start it over again. You can also use them as a reminder to stand up and stretch every so often. These timers come in a variety of colors, each with different time pre-sets, so be sure to pick the one with the time lengths you think your loved one will want. <em>\u2014 Nicole Lee, Commerce Writer</em></p><a class=\"athena-button rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwODNXREcyQzYvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTZ5LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiMTJjNzdhNy04ZGI3LTQ5NWItOTljMy04NDE1ZGRhMTEyOWQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfERwUUmxCXdNmknJ3jMGdzISoRB15o53iAj969tCv32&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB083WDG2C6%2F\" id=\"c2d7ba25796c4167828f2460685be793\">Buy Mooas timer at Amazon - $19</a><h2>Belkin BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 MagSafe charging station</h2><figure><img alt=\"Belkin BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/63cf60f0-55ff-11ed-bebc-5140909b3a52\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>Apple devotees will appreciate <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwQjVYWVg3QlAvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTZ4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiMTJjNzdhNy04ZGI3LTQ5NWItOTljMy04NDE1ZGRhMTEyOWQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUhAOExYiU3g8em6ljr45pcRlHMOCvbYWCrwGxifQZJi&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0B5XYX7BP%2F\">Belkin\u2019s BoostCharge Pro</a>, which will charge an iPhone, an Apple Watch and a pair of AirPods simultaneously.

But with the open-world design of <em>Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>, instead of simply getting an updated map with a linear path from start to finish, it feels like there's a vast countryside to explore. Then you add a deeper story with three branching paths, along with a bunch of quality-of-life improvements and tweaks to the traditional Pok\u00e9mon format, and you have a game that's a blast to get lost in \u2014 even with the title's unfortunate performance issues.</p><h2>Welcome to Paldea</h2><p>As always, the goal in <em>Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet </em>is to become <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuYeHPFR3f0\">the very best</a>. However, the twist for this generation is that you're also a student at a nearby academy (Naranja in scarlet, Uva in Violet), which is where you'll meet the other important characters in your story, or in this case stories. Nemona is a big-sister type who serves as both your rival and your guide as you try to become a Pok\u00e9mon League champion. She's a helluva lot more likable than Hop from <em>Sword</em> and <em>Shield</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>and she helps teach you some of the basics of battling, which is helpful because you don't actually spend a lot of time in classes.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"In Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, Nemona is a big sister-type that acts as both your rival and comrade. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/2d85e290-6a8f-11ed-bb5e-99448da6c712\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Then there's Team Star, which is sort of this generation's Team Rocket equivalent, except that this time the gang is more like an afterschool club with a bad reputation and way too much funding. Finally there's Arven, the son of the new professors (Professor Turo or  Professor Sada depending on your version of the game), who is on a hunt to find the fabled Herba Mystica \u2014 magical plants that are unique to Paldea.</p><p>Sure, the journey to collect eight gym badges and defeat the Elite 4 is as straightforward as ever (well, as much as it can be in an open-world game). But learning the motivation behind Arven's search for Titan Pok\u00e9mon nearly brought a tear to my eye. And by introducing special super-sized Pok\u00e9mon, the game has the freedom to add a new type of combat beyond your battles with trainers and wild monsters.</p><figure><img alt=\"Arven is the main character in the Path of Titans storyline as he tries to uncover the secret behind the Herba Mystica. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/572da470-6a8f-11ed-afe9-aeaaa17c6e5c\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, for the Starfall Street storyline, <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em> use this twist to introduce yet another twist on Pok\u00e9mon battling. Instead of battling a handful of underlings one-by-one, you use your top three Pok\u00e9mon to take down waves of enemy monsters off-screen sort of like a Pok\u00e9mon-theme auto-battler, which plays out more like an endurance test than the game's traditional turn-based combat. And at the end, you battle the boss of each crew before learning about what made them join Team in the first place which eventually leads to a surprisingly wholesome redemption arc.</p><p>The big impact of this is that by having three storylines instead of one, Scarlet and Violet is able to tell a bigger tale from multiple perspectives unlike so many previous entries. And I think this approach really pays off because the paths that don't have anything to do with becoming the number one trainer deliver some of the most heartwarming moments the series has ever produced.</p><h2>So much room for activities</h2><figure><img alt=\"Each version of the game has a slightly different roster of Pokemon you can catch, such as the Bagon line which is only available in Violet. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/dfe5cb80-6a8f-11ed-be39-e9a0735175bc\" /><figcaption>After nine generations, I finally caught my first shiny during a normal playthrough. Note: The Salamence line is only available in <em>Violet</em>. Scarlet gets the <em>Tyranitar</em> line instead.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Aside from the multiple storylines, the move to an open-world game design is a big change for the franchise. We got a taste of this with the Wild Area in <em>Sword</em> and <em>Shield</em> (and <em>Legends: Arceus</em> as well), but for generation nine, Scarlet and Violet have really leaned into this fresh approach.</p><p>Right away, the world feels big \u2014  I nearly got lost just 10 minutes into the game before I even made it to the academy. From there, things get even better, because you quickly get the ability to use your box-art legendary as a vehicle, allowing you to cruise to one point or another in style. Meanwhile, the landscape is littered with Pok\u00e9mon in a way that feels downright bucolic. I stumbled on Magikarp splashing happily away in lakes and rivers, while in other areas I found a circle of Teddiursa gathered around an Ursaring, as if daddy was telling his kids a story while camping. The downside, though, is that because the world is so big and opposing trainers are often spread quite thin, sometimes it feels a bit lonely, as if there's more space than the developers know what to do with.</p><figure><img alt=\"Don't talk to me or my sons ever again. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/4bc9e1b0-6a90-11ed-b7ff-2a035e4da00e\" /><figcaption>Don't talk to me or my sons ever again. </figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Outside of the big towns, there aren't a lot of other settlements, and aside from the academy and the main Pok\u00e9mon gyms, you can't even really go inside buildings. On top of that, because enemy trainers don't engage you on sight anymore, sometimes it feels like you're on a hunt for people instead of Pok\u00e9mon. Don't get me wrong, there are also a ton of items and hidden treasures littered across the map (on top of a full post-game zone and four bonus legendaries), but sometimes I felt like I just wanted more of everything. More enemy trainers, more towns and more events that aren't tried to the three main stories.</p><p>I also need to point out that using the main map makes me feel crazy. While you can't pin locations for revisiting later like in <em>BotW</em>, it's easy to set destination markers to highlight your next gym or story event. The issue is that when you hit Y to open the primary world map, every time North is orientated in a seemingly random direction, which makes figuring out where you are and where you want to go more annoying than it should be.</p><figure><img alt=\"When a Pokemon terastallizes, they'll get a crystalline ornament on their head that correspond to their tera type and a subsequent power boost for those moves. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/71e94020-6a90-11ed-9f07-e52faf02b80b\" /><figcaption>Some tera types looks cooler than others...</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Other major changes include Terastallizing, which allows a Pok\u00e9mon to power up and potentially change its default type, which can act as a surprise during battles when your opponent is expecting something else. It's a neat twist on the Gigantamax and Max Evolution mechanics we've seen in previous games, though the effect can look a bit silly for certain Pok\u00e9mon, particularly flying types which are represented by three giant crystalline balloons that pop out of their heads.</p><p>But to me, some of my favorite tweaks are the smaller quality-of-life changes added in <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>. The new auto-heal feature lets you restore HP to wounded monsters simply by highlighting them and pressing the - button. TMs are now also craftable, so you can more easily teach your monsters the moves you really want. And instead of move tutors, you can relearn forgotten attacks right from a Pok\u00e9mon's summary instead of having to find a specific person/location in the game.</p><figure><img alt=\"Between all the gyms, Titan Pokemon and Team Star bosses, there a total of 18 different badges to collect in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/39985f10-6a92-11ed-bebb-0438c66a8dda\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Of course, the move to an open-world design isn't without its flaws, with the main one being that there isn't any level scaling for enemies. So while technically you can go anywhere you want and tackle gyms in any order, that isn't really true in practice. This means you need to follow a somewhat pre-determined progression because if you try to jump straight from the starter zones into areas with a bunch of high-level monsters, you're going to get clobbered. Same goes for tackling trainers that have fully evolved squads, while you're still rocking a level 15 <a href=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Fidough_(Pok%C3%A9mon)\">Fidough</a>. There are also a couple areas that are walled up until you complete specific story events, and while it's possible to climb or jump over some barricades, it's generally not a good idea. Thankfully, if you ever lose your way or forget what to do next, you can always ask Nurse Joy (or one of her countless sisters) at a Pok\u00e9mon center, who will suggest the best place for you to go next.</p><h1>Performance woes</h1><p>When you need to call attention to a game's performance it's usually for one of two reasons: it's either a graphical tour de force or it runs as smooth as the skin of a <a href=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Qwilfish_(Pok%C3%A9mon)\">Qwilfish</a>. And sadly for <em>Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>, it's the latter. The game just kind of chugs. Even doing simple stuff like panning the camera around can result in choppy framerates, with slowdown getting worse in more congested areas like cities and towns. NPCs in the background can also look like slideshows, as they slowly stutter step across the screen. And when you look at things up close, textures often look flat while shadows are big and blotchy, not to mention all the jaggies you see from diagonal lines (a little anti-aliasing would go a long way). Don't get me wrong, it's not an ugly game, but I feel like that biggest game franchise in the world can do better.</p><figure><img alt=\"Between the blotchy shadows and the low-res textures, sometimes it's hard to appreciate the game's art-style. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/b7fa9140-6a90-11ed-b6b3-835520e19484\" /><figcaption>The performance issues in certain areas of the game sometimes make graphics in Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet look a bit rough.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>It's almost like Gamefreak's engine for Pok\u00e9mon puts a massive strain on the Switch's hardware, which is pretty mind-boggling from a game that looks similar to <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, except that it's not nearly as pretty, it's lot less dense and it's way way smaller in size. I even suffered three crashes over my 35 hours of game time along with countless other minor bugs and visual glitches (I got stuck inside terrain twice, once of which required me to restart the game).</p><p>Thankfully, <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet's</em> autosave system is pretty reliable, so even when the game crashed, I never lost more than a couple minutes of progress. Regardless, while no software is bug-free, the latest Pok\u00e9mon runs a lot worse than your typical video game, and as a whole, the game succeeds in spite of its performance, which is kind of depressing.</p><h2>Which version should you get?</h2><p>Without giving too much away, aside from a handful of Pok\u00e9mon that are only available in one version or the other, the <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Version_Differences_and_Exclusives\">main differences between <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em></a> come down to their respective legendaries and how that plays into the final endgame area. So if you prefer more historical-looking monsters like Koraidon (korai means ancient in Japanese), pick <em>Scarlet</em>. And if you like sleeker, more sci-fi looking Pok\u00e9mon like Miraidon (mirai means future in Japanese) go for Violet.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt=\"If you manage your Pokemon right, you can join Nemona as a Pokemon League champion. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/a70d55d0-6a8f-11ed-a73f-b47b5a1b5da8\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>For a series that I started playing in middle school, all the changes in <em>Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet </em>result in a game that feels fresh but still familiar. The world is bigger than ever, and now you have the freedom to explore it how you like (mostly). The addition of extra storylines also allows the game to tell a deeper and more engaging narrative than any Pok\u00e9mon game in recent history.

Their 360 audio is much more immersive than the first Pro's, as well, thanks to their virtual 5.1- and 7.1-channel arrangements. Samsung also claims that the newer Pro's active noise cancellation feature is 40 percent better than the first, and we did find that the model can do a better job at blocking most environmental noise.
