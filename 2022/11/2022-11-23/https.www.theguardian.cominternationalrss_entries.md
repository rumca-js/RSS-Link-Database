<p>Embarking on his final World Cup at the age of 39, the full-back believes he is part of the strongest Brazil squad of recent years</p><p>It doesn’t take much to get Dani Alves going. It doesn’t take anything in fact: sometimes just a hello will do. The Brazilian is falling about laughing before he’s even asked the first question. Laughing? He’s cackling.</p><p>“Let’s go!” he says and immediately he’s off, charging all over the place, a little like he plays. Like he used to, at least. There is a moment somewhere in the middle of a conversation that crashes by, virtually every word an excuse to crack up, grin never wiped from his face, when he says: “I think people are confused: people think football’s played inside those four white lines and it’s not; football’s played in the dressing room.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/23/dani-alves-i-love-this-game-brazil-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>On eve of his side’s World Cup opener against Serbia, ‘Professor Tite’ explains dancing is about ‘respect for the culture’</p><p>The question about dancing came about 35 minutes in. And in fairness, it wasn’t as random as it sounds. Earlier in the week Raphinha announced that Brazil’s squad had prepared and rehearsed 10 different dance routines to be unveiled each time they score at this World Cup. So, a Brazilian journalist asked Tite: “What is the importance of this cultural phenomenon? How important is it to dance? What is the message we can convey to the world by dancing?”</p><p>“Naturality,” the Brazil coach responded immediately. “Respect for the culture, respect for who we are. It is happiness, it is joy. Yes, it is a moment for us to be focused and serious. But there are moments when we can have fun, when we can vibrate. Everyone has their own way. Our way is dancing.” Perhaps this offers a small idea of why Brazil’s wise and wizened head coach can be such fascinating company. There is a lightly worn intellect there, a love of words, an attention to detail, a dignity and a levity, as well as the basic decency to give a sincere question a sincere answer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/23/wise-wizened-brazil-coach-tite-extols-naturality-of-celebratory-dancing">Continue reading...</a>

## Gavi makes World Cup history for Spain in 7-0 thrashing of feeble Costa Rica

<p>Let’s do this by numbers, shall we? For the first time in four World Cups, Spain won their opening game. Ferran Torres scored their 100th goal in the tournament and Gavi, one of two teenagers starting this match, became their youngest scorer. They were just two of six goalscorers with Spain reaching that magical number the vidiprinter needs to spell out to avoid confusion. They took 17 shots, allowed none, and scored 7 (seven) times. No wonder by the time that Carlos Soler scored the sixth, his celebration consisted of a point and a wink, a “we’re here”.</p><p>And there was still time for Alvaro Morata to add another, two minutes later. Down on the bench, Luis Enrique was laughing, his team having surely presented their candidacy for the competition. Not least because those weren’t the only numbers and it was the way it felt too. Spain played over one thousand passes here, and if the old question used to run “yeah, but how many of them mattered?” the new answer looks like it could well be: all of them. It is hard to recall a performance as complete as this.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/23/spain-costa-rica-world-cup-group-e-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At the start of the shoot, she was a no one. By the end, she was a superstar. As  the 80s cult classic starring Madonna as a gorgeous grifter returns, director Susan Seidelman recalls capturing the zeitgeist on a shoestring budget</p><p>Given that it launched the film careers of the then little known <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/aug/07/rosanna-arquette-i-fear-the-world-will-fall-into-the-hands-of-fascist-dictators-and-white-supremacy">Rosanna Arquette</a>, the entirely unknown Aidan Quinn and some singer called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/14/madonna-i-wanted-to-be-somebody-because-i-felt-like-a-nobody">Madonna</a>, 1985’s Desperately Seeking Susan still stakes a good claim to be one of the canniest casting jobs of all time. And that’s before you get to the then even less known supporting actors: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/laurie-metcalf">Laurie Metcalf</a> as Arquette’s tacky sister-in-law! <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/john-turturro">John Turturro</a> as the cheesy club MC! <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/mar/06/john-lurie-fishing-hbo-tv-series">John Lurie</a> barely visible as a saxophone-playing neighbour! <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jul/22/how-we-made-do-the-right-thing-spike-lee">Giancarlo Esposito</a> in a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it role as a street salesman!</p><p>It’s an astonishing roll call of future talent from when they were still young and hungry in Manhattan. And that’s because Desperately Seeking Susan isn’t only set in a time when there were at least as many artists as rats living in New York City, it was a product of that time, too. “The city was falling apart and downtown there were aspiring artists because rent was so cheap. So I wanted to populate the film with people who were authentic to that time. I didn’t care whether someone in Kansas would recognise them, but New Yorkers would know they were New Yorkers,” Susan Seidelman, the film’s director, tells me by video chat from her home in the New Jersey countryside, to which she and her husband recently moved after several decades in downtown New York. (“The area had changed,” she explains with the jadedness of a true New Yorker, albeit one now in New Jersey.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/23/like-a-virgin-madonna-stratospheric-desperately-seeking-susan-seidelman">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After the alcohol ban in Qatar, there is the possibility that England could win the World Cup roared on by sober fans</p><p><br /></p><p>Watching football without a drink was once unthinkable. Then again, there were all sorts of things I wouldn’t have countenanced without the benefit of alcohol: going to a wedding, say; or any party; or any kind of date. The list was long. The length of your list is as good a way as any of gauging your dependence on alcohol. I never got to the stage of needing a drink to go to the shops, but I was most definitely at the stage when an evening with a dear friend wouldn’t hold much appeal if there wasn’t going to be drink involved. </p><p>I’d go to all sorts of trouble to facilitate pre-match drinking. I’d always try to take the train rather than drive to matches, a case of doing the right thing environmentally, but for the wrong reasons. Good for the carbon footprint, bad for my liver.

<p>From the cliffy coastline to the woodlands of the weald, Sussex has been home and sanctuary to author and horseman Julian Roup, who finds its magical landscapes perfectly captured in a new show</p><p>When my wife Jan and I arrived in Sussex in 1980, we started riding the South Downs on moonlit nights. The white chalk paths reflected the light and made the going easy, despite the steep drops and our night-wary horses. Once on the crest, you could see the lights of ships coming up the Channel to one side and the villages twinkling down below on the other. It is a magical space and provided a wonderful introduction to Britain, which we had come to from South Africa. As we clip-clopped home along the dark pathways, curtains would twitch – not surprisingly, as the last night riders hereabouts were smugglers transporting French brandy from the coast to London via these deep, hidden lanes.</p><p>Sussex Landscape: Chalk, Wood and Water, a new exhibition of paintings at Pallant House in Chichester, encapsulates everything I love about Sussex, a landscape I have now crisscrossed on horseback for more than four decades. Chalk Paths, by Eric Ravilious, captures the almost bleak quality of the South Downs in winter, which for centuries was part of the pilgrims’ route to Canterbury. The sense of space and loneliness in Ravilious’s heavily contoured landscape stands in contrast to the area’s heavily populated villages and towns. It reminds me how this place has been home to humankind for millennia, the swelling population eventually pushing back the boar-and-deer-haunted forest of Anderida, leaving the open rolling farmland we see in this picture.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/nov/23/elves-witches-paintings-primal-paradise-sussex">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The man who filmed Skyfall, Blade Runner 2049 and No Country for Old Men started out as a photographer in Devon. He explains why this shot of a bus-stop, taken at the height of the British summer, is his best</p><p><br /></p><p>Early one morning in the summer of 2004, I left my flat in Devon and drove up to Weston-super-Mare to spend the day taking photographs. It was a particularly rainy day, hardly what most people would consider ideal weather for a trip to the seaside. I parked near the southern promenade, wandered towards the Grand Pier and then came across this bus stop. Its architecture perfectly framed the beach cafe selling cockles and mussels in the background – and the dreariness of the British summer.</p><p>I returned to it throughout the day and took variations of this shot, but none were as strong. I didn’t speak to the woman here – I rarely make conversation when I’m taking photographs – but she gave me a kind of wordless nod after looking at me and wondering what on earth I was doing. Just as I went to take the photograph, she looked across at the poster. It was the perfect moment. I loved the juxtaposition of this elderly lady holding her umbrella at the height of the British summer, contrasting with the semi-naked young woman lying in the sunshine on a boardwalk. I liked the age gap between the two.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/nov/23/legendary-cinematographer-roger-deakins-best-photograph-skyfall-blade-runner-weston-super-mare-no-country-for-old-men">Continue reading...</a>

Just ask Denmark, Tunisia, Morocco, Croatia, Mexico and Poland. The Spanish national team do things differently; of course they do. In the modern era they have started their World Cup campaign with all kinds of memorable games: belters (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqtAmhmKDJY">Nigeria 98</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZeiKBMXyVQ">Portugal 18</a>), stunning defeats (Nigeria 98, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxiBdX5F2I8">Switzerland 10</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHhq8CGR1is">Netherlands 14</a>), spectacular false dawns (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFy1GrVPWBI">Ukraine 06</a>), late twists (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjUS759SIoY">South Korea 94</a>, Nigeria 98 yetabloodygain) controversial defeats (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFuKGt5pLtA">Brazil 86</a>) – and, ok, a couple of cagey, forgettable affairs (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejJTJgd_bg">Honduras 82</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sOZqedc9JY">Uruguay 90</a>, and yes Ruben Sosa’s penalty does still occasionally pop up on air traffic control maps).</p><p>What will it be today? It’s tempting to expect a comfortable win, like against <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUUuwWEfBHU">Slovenia in 2002</a>, although we’ve made that mistake before. It’s probably safer to dwell on Spain’s style than their substance. They’re a unique team, fearless tightrope walkers who keep the ball better than anyone in the world.

But Johnson and his enigmatic, drawling sleuth keep us guessing.</p><p>Edward Norton is an insufferable tech bro called Miles Bron who has become a multitrillionaire through his stake in Alpha, an online network fusing data, news and cryptocurrency.

<p>Warm, witty and full of universally brilliant acting, this absolute triumph of a docudrama also serves up huge chunks of knowledge, thanks to excellent talking head historians</p><p>I don’t know how optimists manage, I really don’t. Surely having your hopes constantly dashed – by life, humanity, and rail timetables – is a wearying way to move through the world? A constant abrading of the soul.

I expect fatuous reconstructions of key moments in history by actors embarrassed to be there, in costumes one notch up from school-play quality. I anticipate them spouting lines typed by a monkey who has seen a few episodes of The Tudors and been given a banana and an hour at a desk to do its best. I am certain that there will be interviewees trying to hide their expertise and knowledge – as instructed by the producers – so as not to frighten the horses.

We now have incontrovertible proof that Messi is a glaikit waste of space who isn’t fit to lace Diego Maradona’s boots, and Ronaldo is such a loser that his club have got shot, its owners seemingly so desperate to disassociate themselves with him that they’ve decided to sell up for that one extra level of remove.

I would like to know and I would take my chances.”</p><p>Meanwhile Germany’s interior minister Nancy Faeser, on a visit to a DFB event in Doha, has called Fifa’s stance on the issue “a grave mistake”, adding: “This is not alright, how federations are being put under pressure.

In today’s times it is incomprehensible that Fifa does not want people to openly stand for tolerance and against discrimination. It does not fit in our times and it is not appropriate towards people.”<br /><br />Like the English FA, the DFB decided to u-turn on its decision to wear the rainbow armband under pressure from Fifa.

Musician with Dr Feelgood whose stark chords and pin-sharp riffs made him one of the most distinctive of British rock guitarists<p>The film-maker <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/julien-temple" title="">Julien Temple</a> described the musician Wilko Johnson, who has died aged 75, as “one of the great English eccentrics, a great national treasure waiting to be discovered”. It was thanks partly to Temple’s 2009 documentary, Oil City Confidential, which traced the history of the Canvey Island band Dr Feelgood and Johnson’s role in it, that he enjoyed renewed acclaim towards the end of his life.</p><p>Not that fans of Dr Feelgood in the band’s mid-1970s heyday needed reminding of Johnson’s accomplishments. He was never a guitar virtuoso in the vein of Jeff Beck or Eric Clapton, but he was one of the most distinctive British players in the history of rock’n’roll, having perfected a hair-trigger style that combined stark, percussive chords with pin-sharp riffs. To that, Johnson added an intimidating stage presence. Invariably clad in a black suit, eyes staring out across the audience like searchlights, he roved around the stage with robotic remorselessness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/23/wilko-johnson-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From rapacious businessmen to political power brokers, this literature extends from  biographies of Cornelius Vanderbilt and Tiny Rowland to novels by Scott Fitzgerald and Preti Taneja</p><p>Tycoons, and their long history, are not just rich. The word comes from the Japanese and in the 1850s was used to show ignorant, newly arriving Americans the source of real power in Japan – the Shogun – as opposed to that of the emperor who was merely a figurehead. Thus the first tycoons in the English language were powerful Americans whose power was not immediately obvious – the dealers, the financiers, the owners of politicians as much as the politicians and generals themselves.</p><p>My contribution to the literature of the tycoon comes from the age of Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great when it might have seemed clear to everyone where the greatest power lay in Rome. But these two military titans had a partner, often their senior partner, Marcus Licinius Crassus, a master of financing other politicians, of banking and bribing, of disrupting established systems, a user of money to wield and balance power in very modern ways. Crassus was secretive, restless, ruthlessly focused on detail, somewhat insecure, more personally modest than one might expect, setting many of the standards for his successors in later centuries up until our own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/23/top-10-books-about-tycoons-peter-stothard-crassus">Continue reading...</a>

On that song, No, Tor Maries outlined her manifesto with an anthem of calm defiance: “No is the greatest resistance / No to your nothing existence”, the Bristolian declared, finding urgency in hollow delivery. In the vein of post-punk <em>sprechgesang</em>, her stark rhetoric was set in brutalist concrete. Her fierce rejection of the world around her spurred her to create one that was entirely her own.</p><p>Ironically, it’s this single-mindedness that draws a 700-strong crowd to her sold-out show at Village Underground. Maries performs alone, eyes closed, her body electrified with sudden, angular movements as if possessed by a dance fever. Her face is contorted into something like agony, driven by some animalistic need to sweat it out. She is a source of constant, frenetic movement while the crowd is static. “Everybody twist for me / Well c’mon and crack your knees honey,” she commands of an audience largely comprising <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/6music">6 Music</a> dads and swaying mums in turtlenecks – a real threat, here, rather than an invitation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/23/billy-nomates-review-post-punk-soloist-could-do-with-some-company">Continue reading...</a>

Alongside the late, great former president Satoru Iwata, and the genius hardware designer and Game Boy architect Gunpei Yokoi, he laid the foundations for the company’s enduring success, and helped established its fun-first approach to video games. His smiling, familiar presence at events such as E3 and Tokyo Game Show over the decades – where he has always been happy to appear on-stage, waving around a Master Sword or a Wii Remote – has made him a beloved figure among the Nintendo faithful. He used to show up at midnight launches to sign things for fans; a friend of mine once asked him to draw a Mario doodle on his GameCube at a meet-and-greet, and he cheerfully obliged.

A <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chefpriyanka/?hl=en">vegan chef</a>, <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-modern-tiffin-on-the-go-vegan-dishes-with-a-global-flair-a-cookbook-priyanka-naik/16297692">author</a> and TV personality, she often turns kitchen scraps into inventive new meals and packs up restaurant leftovers – including the bread basket – to take home for later. Instead of tossing the white rice that comes with her takeout meals, which she says she’s “not a huge fan of”, she might throw it in a food processor with beans, potatoes and spices, and shape the mixture into patties for veggie burgers.</p><p>From a climate perspective, Naik’s approach makes sense. While food waste is difficult to measure, one estimate by <a href="https://www.unep.org/regions/north-america/regional-initiatives/promoting-sustainable-lifestyles">the UN</a> Environment Program found that if food waste were a country, it would be the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gasses after China and the US.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/23/reduce-food-waste-at-home">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Russia is turbocharging its indoctrination of young people, using games and influencers to draw them into a militarised Youth Army</p><p>It might seem that Russia’s government has lost the support of its young for good.

<p>Gory and absorbing sci-fi sequel is part Stranger Things, part Orphan Black and all action, with a ridiculously good-looking and super-cool cast</p><p>This expansive but absorbing sequel to the 2018 sci-fi horror feature The Witch: Part 1 presents, as its extra subtitle The Other One, which might suggest a narrative centred on another young “witch”. The first film’s central figure Ja-yoon (Kim Da-mi, briefly returning here) began to exercise her telekinetic powers only two-thirds of the way into Part 1’s narrative. However, Part 2’s heroine Ark 1 (Shin Sia-ah) is, from the off, able to throw whole cars around and beat people up psychically, having been raised in a secret facility where her superpowers were genetically implanted from birth. But Ark 1 was never socialised like Ja-yoon, the latter having been adopted by kindly if elderly normie farmers at a young age, so a lot of the time is spent watching Ark 1 adapt to regular life after she is taken in by young farmer Kyung-hee (Park Eun-bin) and Kyung-hee’s brother Dae-gil (Sung Yoo-bin). (In relatable fashion, she loves the food samples in supermarkets.) The farmers are being menaced by an uncle (Jin Goo) who wants to forcibly seize their farm, but like almost all the men in this film, the gangsters profoundly underestimate the power of slight young women such as Ark 1, Kyung-hee or, indeed, Ja-yoon herself.</p><p>If you grasped all that without having seen Part 1, you’ll notice that the plot is a bit like a Korean version of Stranger Things, with Ark 1 as The Witch’s version of Eleven, the lab-reared victim-prodigy with extraordinary psionic powers. Writer-director Park Hoon-jung has also grafted on a subplot reminiscent of Orphan Black that involves a bunch of telekinetic young people in rival gangs who are connected to the story. They’re all ridiculously good looking and super-cool, like the members of competing K-pop bands but with extremely murderous instincts. (Bear in mind: the film is extremely gory and has deservedly been given an 18 certificate.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/23/the-witch-part-2-review-korean-horror-combines-hi-tech-and-old-style-ass-kicking">Continue reading...</a>

Ancient Apocalypse obviously has an audience, but who on Earth is it?</p><p>Fortunately, you don’t have to watch for long to find out.

<p>‘Fierce, feminist’ show from Francesca Moody is written by former Grange Hill actors Ricky Simmonds and Simon Vaughan and tells an ‘almost true’ story</p><p>A musical about Silvio Berlusconi that is described as “Evita on acid”, written by two former Grange Hill stars and features a song called My Weekend With Vladimir is to be staged in London next year.</p><p>Entitled Berlusconi, it is billed as an “almost true story” and produced by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/10/fleabag-super-producer-francesca-moody-phoebe-waller-bridge-edinburgh-fringe">Francesca Moody</a> who is best known for her success with Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag. The musical depicts the three-time former Italian PM on the eve of the verdict in his trial for tax fraud as he looks back on his rise and fall and resolves to write an autobiographical opera. His story is then told through the eyes of three women: Ilda Boccassini, the Milan magistrate known as Ilda the Red who investigated him; Berlusconi’s second wife, the actor Veronica Lario, who left him in 2009 after nearly 20 years of marriage; and the character of a journalist who is based on real people. “It places a fierce feminist lens on him,” said Moody of the musical. “These women are telling their story.”</p><p>Berlusconi is at <a href="https://www.southwarkplayhouse.co.uk/productions/berlusconi/">Southwark Playhouse Elephant, London</a>, 25 March–29 April<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/nov/23/berlusconi-musical-fleabag-francesca-moody-grange-hill">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Too many people still face the prejudices I had to confront as a working-class Liverpudlian when I tried to become a journalist</p><p>A job interview in Liverpool. I’m Liverpudlian. “Do you write the way you speak,” I was asked. And that was my greeting, I suppose: welcome to the middle-class world. In this case, journalism.

<p>Following Amazon’s Rings of Power series, this beautiful compendium of Tolkien’s  Second Age of Middle-earth stories offers the ideal palate cleanser </p><p>The Lord of the Rings: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/the-rings-of-power--episode-by-episode" title="">The Rings of Power</a> is a contender for the biggest TV event this year, and the show’s estimated 100 million-strong audience represents a huge number of potential new readers. This book covers the same fictional period in Middle-earth history, the Second Age. If you want the genuine Tolkien version of the era, here it is in one rather beautiful package. And it could also be the palate cleanser you crave if you disliked the show and prefer to go back to the authentic flavour of Middle-earth and the doomed island nation of Númenor.</p><p>“Go back” is right. The book marshals material hitherto scattered through many posthumous publications from 1977’s The Silmarillion onwards. In this, it broadly follows recent editions by Tolkien’s son Christopher, who died in 2020. Editor Brian Sibley made the superb 1981 BBC radio adaptation of The Lord of the Rings and knows his Tolkien. Ending long before that story of questing hobbits, the Second Age runs from the end of the mythological Silmarillion and the defeat of primal dark lord Morgoth to the epochal but temporary defeat of his successor Sauron. That’s three-and-a-half millennia.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/23/the-fall-of-numenor-by-jrr-tolkien-review-masterful-world-building-from-the-father-of-fantasy">Continue reading...</a>

Caught alone, several characters meet the stares of Renaissance-style wall paintings. Each room contains a statue of a man’s head that, as a hotel staffer explains, honors a Sicilian legend of a beheaded seducer. A disguised door connects two married couples’ rooms. The visual motif of the first season of The White Lotus, set at a Hawaiian resort, was rot – molding fruit in the title sequence, tropical leaves crawling across the bedspreads, the stench of moral corrosion – but the second season’s is more vigorous: wandering eyes, backdoor arrangements, creeping lust.</p><p>As in the first, the second season, again written and directed by Mike White, kicks off with a dead body (actually, several) then jumps back a week.

<p>The most shocking thing about what happened is that it felt so inevitable</p><p>It’s a story as American as apple pie: a young man walks into a bar with an AR-15, a semiautomatic weapon that is capable of killing a lot of people in a very short time, and proceeds to kill a lot of people in a very short time. The latest iteration of this story came on Saturday night in Colorado Springs. On the eve of the Transgender Day of Remembrance, a gunman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/21/colorado-springs-shooting-mayor-hate-crime">opened fire in an LGBTQ+ nightclub</a>, killing five people and injuring at least 25 in what is widely thought to have been a hate crime. Those numbers would have been far higher had it not been for the bravery of two unarmed people at the bar, who restrained the killer.</p><p>You know what’s most shocking about the massacre in Colorado Springs? The fact that it felt so inevitable. Over the past year there has been an escalation in dangerously dehumanising anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric. The idea that LGBTQ+ people are “<a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23025505/leftist-groomers-homophobia-satanic-panic-explained">groomers” and paedophiles</a> has become a mainstream conservative talking point pushed by everyone from Fox News to Republican politicians. Christina Pushaw, the press secretary for the Florida governor Ron DeSantis, for example, said that a new law preventing Florida schools from teaching kids about LGBTQ+ people should be called the “the anti-grooming bill”. If you’re against it, she <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristinaPushaw/status/1499890719691051008?s=20&amp;t=kjwYldGYlw2YvvSu-KEVIw">tweeted</a>, “you are probably a groomer or at least you don’t denounce the grooming of four- to eight-year-old children”.

It’s like a short film, but one lasting 151 minutes, with something of Jacques Rivette’s Céline and Julie going on their boat trip and Eric Rohmer’s two would-be lovers losing contact with each other in A Tale of Winter.</p><p>Lisa and Giorgi are a medical student and footballer in the Georgian city of Kutaisi who have a chance meeting outside a school (the movie shoots only their feet, taking meet-cute to the next level) and agree to rendezvous at a cafe the next day. But a strange curse or hex changes their appearance overnight (an event greeted by both with mild bemusement) and now they realise they won’t recognise each other. The voiceover narrator cheekily asks the audience to close their eyes at the moment of transformation itself to preserve the magic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/23/what-do-we-see-when-we-look-at-the-sky-review-existential-meet-cute-is-a-magical-mystery">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Florida governor Ron DeSantis passionately praised the former president – now he is being talked about as a possible presidential candidate himself. </p><p>When he was first running for governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis was fulsome in his admiration for Donald Trump. The Yale-educated, Catholic family man may have a very different background to the glamour-loving businessman, but politically they soon became entwined.</p><p>But as Trump’s star has waned, DeSantis has shone brighter. In the midterms, Trump-backed candidates performed poorly, while DeSantis won a resounding victory to become re-elected governor of Florida with his focus on culture war issues. Yet as DeSantis has grown in political popularity, relations between him and Trump have cooled.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/nov/23/trump-v-desantis-ex-presidents-fan-biggest-rival-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>G7 nears a Russian oil price cap; Ukraine setting up ‘invincibility centres’ with heat and power for winter</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">See all our Ukraine coverage</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>The Group of Seven nations are set to soon announce the price cap on Russian oil exports</strong> and the coalition will probably adjust the level a few times a year rather than monthly, a senior US Treasury official said on Tuesday. The G7, including the United States, along with the EU and Australia are slated to implement the price cap on sea-borne exports of Russian oil on 5 December, as part of sanctions intended to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Ukrainians needing basic services if Russia knocks out power stations and other facilities this winter can turn to special “invincibility centres,”</strong> president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday. Thousands of centres spread across the country will offer electricity, heat, water, internet service, mobile phone connections and a pharmacy, free of charge and around the clock. “If massive Russian strikes happen again and it’s clear power will not be restored for hours, the ‘invincibility centres’ will go into action with all key services,” Zelenskiy said.</p><p><strong>Ukrainians are likely to live with blackouts at least until the end of March, </strong>the head of a major energy provider<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-blackouts-likely-across-ukraine-until-march-energy-provider-says?page=with:block-637c5b038f08b0d3de4550c5#block-637c5b038f08b0d3de4550c5"> said,</a> as the government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-blackouts-likely-across-ukraine-until-march-energy-provider-says?page=with:block-637c5dfd8f08bda03cae1939#block-637c5dfd8f08bda03cae1939">started free evacuations</a> for people in Kherson to other regions.</p><p><strong>Kyiv will summon the Hungarian ambassador to protest that prime minister Viktor Orbán went to a football match wearing a scarf depicting some Ukrainian territory as part of Hungary</strong>, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said on Tuesday.
