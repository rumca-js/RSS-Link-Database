## Google Messages has started letting some users react with any emoji

  <p id="YlBslw">Google has started letting some users of its Messages app react to text messages with any emoji, instead of limiting them to the standard set of seven that have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21256975/google-android-messages-rcs-emoji-reactions-test">been available in the app for a while now</a> (<a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/11/23/google-messages-full-emoji-reactions/">via <em>9to5Google</em></a>). The feature’s similar to what other messaging platforms like Slack, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/11/23203582/whatsapp-all-emoji-reactions-feature">WhatsApp</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/19/23360878/telegram-emoji-reactions-status-profile-link-update">paid versions of Telegram</a> have — pressing and holding on a message gives you the standard emoji reactions, but you can then access the picker to react with whatever you want.</p>
<p id="9TaQPW">The expanded emoji reactions appear to be a limited test at this point — <em>9to5Google</em> says it’s heard two reports of it being rolled out, and while one person on <em>The Verge</em>’s staff has access to it, two other people who checked do not.

The law imposes a two-year moratorium on any new permits for certain fossil fuel power plants seeking to mine crypto.</p>
<p id="WfrKy2">In one high-profile case, a struggling gas plant in New York’s Finger Lakes region overcame economic headwinds <a href="https://grist.org/technology/bitcoin-greenidge-seneca-lake-cryptocurrency/">by mining Bitcoin</a>.
