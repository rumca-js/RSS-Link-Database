By the end, she was a superstar. As  the 80s cult classic starring Madonna as a gorgeous grifter returns, director Susan Seidelman recalls capturing the zeitgeist on a shoestring budget</p><p>Given that it launched the film careers of the then little known <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/aug/07/rosanna-arquette-i-fear-the-world-will-fall-into-the-hands-of-fascist-dictators-and-white-supremacy\">Rosanna Arquette</a>, the entirely unknown Aidan Quinn and some singer called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/14/madonna-i-wanted-to-be-somebody-because-i-felt-like-a-nobody\">Madonna</a>, 1985\u2019s Desperately Seeking Susan still stakes a good claim to be one of the canniest casting jobs of all time. And that\u2019s before you get to the then even less known supporting actors: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/laurie-metcalf\">Laurie Metcalf</a> as Arquette\u2019s tacky sister-in-law! <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/john-turturro\">John Turturro</a> as the cheesy club MC! <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/mar/06/john-lurie-fishing-hbo-tv-series\">John Lurie</a> barely visible as a saxophone-playing neighbour! <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jul/22/how-we-made-do-the-right-thing-spike-lee\">Giancarlo Esposito</a> in a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it role as a street salesman!</p><p>It\u2019s an astonishing roll call of future talent from when they were still young and hungry in Manhattan. And that\u2019s because Desperately Seeking Susan isn\u2019t only set in a time when there were at least as many artists as rats living in New York City, it was a product of that time, too. \u201cThe city was falling apart and downtown there were aspiring artists because rent was so cheap. So I wanted to populate the film with people who were authentic to that time. I didn\u2019t care whether someone in Kansas would recognise them, but New Yorkers would know they were New Yorkers,\u201d Susan Seidelman, the film\u2019s director, tells me by video chat from her home in the New Jersey countryside, to which she and her husband recently moved after several decades in downtown New York. (\u201cThe area had changed,\u201d she explains with the jadedness of a true New Yorker, albeit one now in New Jersey.)</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/23/like-a-virgin-madonna-stratospheric-desperately-seeking-susan-seidelman\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/23/daniel-ricciardo-red-bull-reserve-third-driver-next-season", "title": "Daniel Ricciardo secures F1 future with return to Red Bull as third driver", "date_published": "2022-11-23 16:37:29+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>\u2018I\u2019m truly excited to be coming back home\u2019 says Australian</li><li>Struggles at McLaren had left him without a race seat</li></ul><p>Daniel Ricciardo will join Red Bull as their third driver for the 2023 Formula One season, the Australian reuniting with team he raced for between 2014 and 2018 and with whom he scored seven grand prix victories.</p><p>Ricciardo was dropped by McLaren at the end of this season and was unable to secure a full-time race seat with a competitive team for next year.

Miyamoto, who has had a hand in the development of most Nintendo games and consoles, is the most influential game designer alive. Nintendo is part of the creative marrow of the games industry: there is barely a game developer today who has not played, and been influenced by, Miyamoto.</p><p>He has worked at Nintendo for 45 years and, since the 1990s, he has been the face of the company. Alongside the late, great former president Satoru Iwata, and the genius hardware designer and Game Boy architect Gunpei Yokoi, he laid the foundations for the company\u2019s enduring success, and helped established its fun-first approach to video games. His smiling, familiar presence at events such as E3 and Tokyo Game Show over the decades \u2013 where he has always been happy to appear on-stage, waving around a Master Sword or a Wii Remote \u2013 has made him a beloved figure among the Nintendo faithful. He used to show up at midnight launches to sign things for fans; a friend of mine once asked him to draw a Mario doodle on his GameCube at a meet-and-greet, and he cheerfully obliged.

The first film\u2019s central figure Ja-yoon (Kim Da-mi, briefly returning here) began to exercise her telekinetic powers only two-thirds of the way into Part 1\u2019s narrative. However, Part 2\u2019s heroine Ark 1 (Shin Sia-ah) is, from the off, able to throw whole cars around and beat people up psychically, having been raised in a secret facility where her superpowers were genetically implanted from birth. But Ark 1 was never socialised like Ja-yoon, the latter having been adopted by kindly if elderly normie farmers at a young age, so a lot of the time is spent watching Ark 1 adapt to regular life after she is taken in by young farmer Kyung-hee (Park Eun-bin) and Kyung-hee\u2019s brother Dae-gil (Sung Yoo-bin). (In relatable fashion, she loves the food samples in supermarkets.) The farmers are being menaced by an uncle (Jin Goo) who wants to forcibly seize their farm, but like almost all the men in this film, the gangsters profoundly underestimate the power of slight young women such as Ark 1, Kyung-hee or, indeed, Ja-yoon herself.</p><p>If you grasped all that without having seen Part 1, you\u2019ll notice that the plot is a bit like a Korean version of Stranger Things, with Ark 1 as The Witch\u2019s version of Eleven, the lab-reared victim-prodigy with extraordinary psionic powers. Writer-director Park Hoon-jung has also grafted on a subplot reminiscent of Orphan Black that involves a bunch of telekinetic young people in rival gangs who are connected to the story. They\u2019re all ridiculously good looking and super-cool, like the members of competing K-pop bands but with extremely murderous instincts. (Bear in mind: the film is extremely gory and has deservedly been given an 18 certificate.)</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/23/the-witch-part-2-review-korean-horror-combines-hi-tech-and-old-style-ass-kicking\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/23/thanksgiving-turkey-shortages", "title": "US turkey shortages and rising prices add extra stress to Thanksgiving", "date_published": "2022-11-23 11:00:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Inflation and a long outbreak of avian flu before the holidays mean higher prices and smaller birds \u2013 or none at all</p><p>Turkey, the reigning poultry of Thanksgiving, may be harder for millions across the US to obtain this year, as experts warn of shortages and spiking prices ahead of the holidays.</p><p>With Thanksgiving on Thursday, experts have flagged the problem of inflated turkey costs combined with a decreased supply of the bird, especially large ones.
