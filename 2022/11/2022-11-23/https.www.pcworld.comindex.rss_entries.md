<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>The latest high-profile heist of valuable digital currency has nothing to do with Bitcoin or Ethereum. Nope, this time thieves are stealing currency and assets from <em>Roblox </em>players. <em>Roblox </em>is a massively popular kid&rsquo;s game platform that has a disturbing amount of real money trading hands, and it&rsquo;s become the target of a series of Chrome extensions hiding malware. </p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/backdoored-chrome-extension-installed-by-200-000-roblox-players/&amp;xcust=2-1-1390739-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">According to BleepingComputer</a>, at least two extensions posted to the official Chrome Web Store were fronts for a backdoor program that gathers a <em>Roblox </em>player&rsquo;s user info and potentially makes them a target for hacking, especially if they&rsquo;re also a user of the third-party Rolimons.com currency trading system. </p>



<p>The &ldquo;SearchBlox&rdquo; extensions claim to allow you to search quickly for other users, and were apparently legitimate at some point, but have been compromised within the last month. While one of the extensions has been downloaded less than a thousand times, the other has more than 200,000 installations. There&rsquo;s circumstantial evidence that one or more people are stealing <em>Roblox </em>currency with the data gathered by the hidden backdoor. </p>



<p>At the time of writing, both &ldquo;SearchBlox&rdquo; extensions are still live in the Chrome Web Store, with the primary listing enjoying a &ldquo;Featured&rdquo; badge. This, despite the fact that Google culled similar compromised extensions just last month. </p>



<p>As always, be wary of third-party browser extensions, and check their updates to make sure they haven&rsquo;t been &ldquo;injected&rdquo; with unnecessary or malicious code. And on a bit of a tangent, if you&rsquo;re letting your children play <em>Roblox</em>, you might want to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/09/the-trouble-with-roblox-the-video-game-empire-built-on-child-labour&amp;xcust=2-1-1390739-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">take a closer look at its monetization and labor issues</a> &mdash; <em>Minecraft </em>might be a better kid-friendly choice.  </p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Need to edit photos or video, but don&rsquo;t want to learn all the ins and outs of Adobe Creative Cloud? You&rsquo;re in luck. Right now during Black Friday, you can pick up <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/adobe-photoshop-elements-2023-for-windows-download/p/N82E16832505632?Item=N82E16832505632&amp;xcust=2-1-1389703-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Adobe Photoshop Elements 2023</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/adobe-premiere-elements-2023-for-windows-download/p/N82E16832505638?Item=N82E16832505638&amp;xcust=2-1-1389703-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Adobe Premier Elements 2023</a> via Newegg for just $50 each, or $75 as a bundle (after coupon). That&rsquo;s 50 percent off each or a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/adobe-photoshop-elements-premiere-elements-2023-for-windows-download/p/N82E16832505635?Item=N82E16832505635&amp;xcust=2-1-1389703-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">whopping 62 percent off for the combo</a>.</p>



<p>As a standalone purchase, this software is far friendlier on your wallet&mdash;you pay only once, unlike with a Creative Cloud subscription. This discount on the new 2023 edition, which just launched at the end of September, sweetens the appeal further. You&rsquo;ll pay about the same as earlier deals on the 2022 edition, while getting additional features.</p>



<p>And those features, like animating parts of photos, are what make Adobe&rsquo;s Elements products so great. They&rsquo;re easy to learn and use, while simplifying tasks that used to take pros a long time to master. You get tools to make common edits a snap, plus AI assistance that transforms previously heavy work like selecting parts of a photo into a single click of a button. You can also lean on a series of &ldquo;Guided Edits&rdquo; that take you step-by-step through work like basic adjustments, visual effects, quick fixes, and more. And web and mobile apps (currently in beta) allow you to take your edits with you, rather than being tied to a specific computer.</p>



<p>Between the all-time low price and the new features, this deal is an slam-dunk if you&rsquo;ve been wanting to jazz up your photos and videos. Hop on it soon, as it won&rsquo;t last beyond this weekend.</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Sure, Steam Deck may get all the headlines these days, but when you want a no-nonsense, pick-up-and-play portable gaming experience, the vaunted Nintendo Switch still holds the crown&mdash;especially if you want to play Nintendo exclusives like <em>Kirby </em>and <em>Bayonetta</em>. Good news! If you&rsquo;re looking to hop onboard the bandwagon, Nintendo&rsquo;s annual <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-White-Joy/dp/B098RKWHHZ&amp;xcust=2-1-1390712-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Black Friday Switch bundle is back</a> and it&rsquo;s the perfect starting point for experiencing everything the console has to offer.</p>



<p>Nintendo&rsquo;s Black Friday Switch deal isn&rsquo;t technically a discount&mdash;the system costs the same $299 as usual and it&rsquo;s only available with the red and blue Joycon controllers. But you&rsquo;ll get some very nice extras tossed into the pot too: A free copy of <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> and a code for three free months to Nintendo Switch Online, which you&rsquo;ll need to play games online. <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> is <em>the</em> game to pick up on the Switch and usually costs $50 to $60 on its own. I&rsquo;ve been playing it weekly for years now, both on the go and hooked up to my TV!</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll find the Black Friday Nintendo Switch deal at the usual retailers:</p>

In our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/693933/samsung-galaxy-book2-pro-360-review-a-thin-light-powerful-beauty.html">review of the 2-in-1</a>, we absolutely loved the outstanding battery life and superb AMOLED touchscreen. We gave it four out of five stars plus an Editor&rsquo;s Choice award. Talk about high praise, eh?</p>



<p>The Galaxy Book2 Pro 360 is rocking an Intel Core i7 1260P CPU, Intel Iris Xe graphics, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of SSD storage. The gorgeous, vivid 15.6-inch AMOLED display has a resolution of 1920&times;1080 and is touch-enabled. It&rsquo;s wonderfully luscious for streaming video or general use, and overall performance is peppy. According to our reviewer, &ldquo;the display is a real selling point&mdash;battery life, too.&rdquo; When we put the Pro 360 through our battery benchmark, the laptop lasted over 14 hours, so you won&rsquo;t need to sweat if you forget your charger at home. That&rsquo;s well more than a full work day, for sure.</p>



<p>This is a killer deal, especially for a light, powerful convertible with an AMOLED display. You best scoop it up now before it&rsquo;s gone forever.</p>

## Roku’s Streaming Stick 4K, the best media streamer, is $25 for Black Friday

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>&ldquo;If you want to buy a streaming player without overthinking it, just get the&nbsp;Roku Streaming Stick 4K.&rdquo; So proclaims TechHive, PCWorld&rsquo;s streaming-obsessed sister site, en route to crowning the device as the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techhive.com/article/582754/best-media-streaming-device.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1390551-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed">best media streamer you can buy</a>. Black Friday week is a prime time to hop onboard the bandwagon because Amazon is selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC&amp;xcust=2-1-1390551-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Roku Streaming Stick 4K for just $25</a>, a full 50 percent off the usual price.</p>



<p>Our reviewer sums up its highlights perfectly: &ldquo;This $50 streaming dongle feels fast and fluid, and it supports 4K HDR video with both Dolby Vision and HDR10+,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;More importantly, it&rsquo;s a straightforward streaming device full of helpful features, and its improved Wi-Fi receiver helps it get better reception than previous low-cost Roku players.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Roku&rsquo;s interface could be more helpful at suggesting new content, and the Roku Streaming Stick 4K only supports wireless connections, so skip it if you need an Ethernet connection. If you can overlook those ultra-minor quibbles, however, this is <em>the</em> stick to buy to add streaming capabilities to any TV&mdash;especially at this steep Black Friday discount. This $25 device would also be a massive quality of life upgrade if you own an older streaming stick that struggles to keep pace with your menu navigation. Plus, you can check out Roku&rsquo;s new Weird Al movie starring Daniel Radcliffe. Don&rsquo;t miss out!</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>At full price, Microsoft 365 is already a good deal. Not only does the subscription give access to Microsoft Office software, but 1TB of cloud storage per user, too. Moreover, you can add time to your account with deals throughout the year&mdash;especially during Black Friday. Right now at Newegg, just <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails?ItemList=Combo.4521997&amp;xcust=2-1-1389623-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$70 lets you start or top-up a Family plan for 15 months</a>. That&rsquo;s 44% off the normal price, plus the deal includes a bonus subscription to NordVPN, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html">one of our top VPN picks</a>!</p>



<p>For just $4.66 per month, up to six individuals can use Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Teams, Outlook, OneNote, Skype, and a host of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/products-apps-services&amp;xcust=2-1-1389623-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">other services and apps</a> across all devices. You also get 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage per user, which also syncs across all devices and supports automatic photo and video backups on mobile. OneDrive also has <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/607361/onedrive-personal-vault-how-to-use-it.html">Personal Vault</a>, a unique security feature that helps safeguard your sensitive files in the cloud.</p>



<p>If you fill all six seats, your total works out to just $0.77 per user per month. That&rsquo;s a smoking deal: Competitors charge the same list price (or more) for a shared pool of 2TB data. And you don&rsquo;t get access to other software apps, either.</p>



<p>Making this deal even sweeter is that bonus software. If a VPN isn&rsquo;t your thing, you can instead choose a bundle with a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails?ItemList=Combo.4528133&amp;xcust=2-1-1389623-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">1-year AVG Ultimate subscription (1 PC)</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails?ItemList=Combo.4528137&amp;xcust=2-1-1389623-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">1-year EST NOD32 Antivirus 2023 subscription (1 PC)</a>, or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails?ItemList=Combo.4528135&amp;xcust=2-1-1389623-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">1-year Bitdefender Internet Security 2022 subscription (1 PC)</a>. You can also pay $10 more ($80 total) for a combo that instead includes <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails?ItemList=Combo.4522087&amp;xcust=2-1-1389623-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">3 free months of Xbox PC Game Pass</a>. These extras are limited to one account.</p>



<p>If you like this deal, jump on it while you still can&mdash;and if you have the cash for it, you can stock up on codes. Microsoft lets you stack subscription codes in your account, up to five years total. To get close to that amount, you can buy one of each combo type (since it&rsquo;s limit one per customer), or instead opt for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/620341970&amp;xcust=2-1-1389623-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">this similar Walmart deal</a> (same price, no bonus software).</p>



<p>One last tip: You can often get another extra free month by opting into automatic billing when applying the code. Just turn it off in your settings after, to avoid a surprise renewal at full price. Not that you need to worry about that, because you can keep topping up your account with deals like this later on.</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Video editors know how to put a monitor to the test. They need a monitor with great color accuracy, a healthy color gamut, 4K resolution and, preferably, HDR. Very few monitors meet all these requirements, and fewer still do so at a competitive price&mdash;but a handful stand out from the crowd. These are the best monitors for video editing. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Asus&rsquo; ProArt PA32DC is best in class if you need a top-tier monitor for video editing. It will set you back $3,499&mdash;and it&rsquo;s worth every penny</p>

<p>This monitor has a 32-inch 4K OLED panel that delivers super-sharp video, excellent color accuracy, and covers a wide range of professional color gamuts including Rec.2020 and DCI-P3. The OLED panel also has superior contrast and looks great in HDR, which is good news if you need to edit HDR content. No other monitor on this list comes close to matching the PA32DC&rsquo;s HDR quality.</p>

<p>The ProArt PA32DC&rsquo;s professional focus is obvious from its design. It&rsquo;s extremely sturdy and includes a built-in handle. The height-adjustable stand can be detached and replaced with a pair of screw-on legs that collapse flat. These features might seem odd for a 32-inch monitor but are great if your work requires that you travel to a client&rsquo;s worksite or assist filmmakers on-set.</p>

<p>It also packs plenty of connectivity including a total of five video inputs. One is a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 65 watts of Power Delivery for charging connected devices. The on-screen menu system is extensive and offers a buffet of image-quality customization. The monitor even has a built-in colorimeter to assist with calibration.</p>

<p>The Dell U3223QE is a 32-inch monitor with 4K resolution and an IPS Black display panel. This panel, which is found in just a handful of monitors, has an improved contrast ratio when compared to older IPS panels. The result is a better sense of realism and dimensionality. The monitor also has a wide color gamut, great color accuracy, and a high maximum brightness.</p>

<p>HDR is supported and looks acceptable, though the Dell U3223QE is significantly behind the more expensive Asus ProArt PA32DC. However, alternative monitors in the sub-$1,000 bracket aren&rsquo;t any better.</p>

<p>Connectivity is excellent. The monitor has a USB-C port with 95 watts of Power Delivery and DisplayPort Alternate Mode. It also drives a USB-C hub that expands connectivity to multiple USB-A ports, ethernet, and DisplayPort-out.</p>

<p>Video editors who want a smaller monitor should consider the 27-inch <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-27-4k-usb-c-hub-monitor-u2723qe/apd/210-bdpf/monitors-monitor-accessories#techspecs_section&amp;xcust=2-1-1386286-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Dell U2723QE</a>. It packs nearly identical features for a couple hundred dollars less than the U3223QE.</p>

<p>Asus&rsquo; ProArt PA348CGV is a versatile ultrawide monitor that&rsquo;s great for video editing&mdash;and many other tasks.</p>

<p>This monitor has a 34-inch ultrawide panel with 3440&times;1440 resolution. The resolution might be an issue for video editors who need to work in 4K, but very few ultrawide monitors offer a higher resolution than this. Video editors will appreciate the ultrawide screen&rsquo;s improved multitasking and ability to show more of a video timeline at once.</p>

<p>The ProArt PA348CGV&rsquo;s default color accuracy is superior to all other monitors on this list, despite its reasonable price, and it supports up to 98 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut. This monitor has a standard IPS panel, so its contrast ratio doesn&rsquo;t live up to the Dell U3223QE, but it otherwise goes toe-to-toe with Dell&rsquo;s premium 4K monitor. HDR support is a bit better than the Dell, ranking it among the best you&rsquo;ll find below $1,000.</p>

<p>Asus sweetens the deal with a wide range of features. The monitor has a USB-C port that can deliver up to 95 watts of Power Delivery for charging a connected laptop or tablet. It also supports a refresh rate of up to 120Hz and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, which makes this a proper PC gaming monitor.</p>

<p>The Asus ProArt PA348CGV retails at an MSRP of $749.99, undercutting alternative ultrawide monitors with similar performance and features. &nbsp;Its versatility and pricing make it perfect for video editors who work from a home office.</p>

<p>Asus&rsquo; current ProArt line is leagues ahead of most competitors, and that remains true even when shopping on a budget.</p>

<p>This is a 27-inch 4K monitor with an IPS panel. The monitor&rsquo;s contrast ratio, color accuracy, and maximum brightness all rival more expensive monitors on this list. Owners can easily tweak the monitor&rsquo;s image quality with its extensive on-screen menu options. Its out-of-box image quality is not far behind the Dell U3223QE despite the large difference in price.</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s the catch? This monitor is not a wide color gamut monitor, meaning it displays only 86 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut&mdash;however, it handles the entire sRGB color gamut. The monitor&rsquo;s HDR support is mediocre, too, though that&rsquo;s to be expected given its price.</p>

<p>The ProArt PA279CV has a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 65 watts of Power Delivery for charging a connected device. The USB-C port also acts as a hub that extends connectivity to four additional USB-A ports. Asus throws in adaptive-sync support for smooth gameplay, though the monitor doesn&rsquo;t support a refresh rate above 60Hz.</p>

<p>Asus prices this monitor competitively at $449.99. The Asus PA279CV stands out from other affordable alternatives because of its color accuracy, image customization options, and USB-C support.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-monitor-for-video-editing">What to look for in a monitor for video editing</h2>



<p>Video editors, like most people, will enjoy a monitor with excellent image quality&mdash;but most video editors have specific and demanding needs. Video editing can demand great color accuracy, 4K resolution, and support for HDR, among other features. Here&rsquo;s what to look for in a video editing monitor.</p>



<h3 id="great-color-accuracy-is-a-must-have">Great color accuracy is a must-have</h3>



<p>Color accuracy is a key benchmark for video editing. Video editors are responsible for ensuring a video looks right when viewed on a wide variety of displays and that its presentation fits the style the project demands. It&rsquo;s hard to judge this, however, when working on a monitor with inaccurate color. High color accuracy is necessary for a video editor to guarantee the final cut looks right.</p>



<p>Thankfully, all the monitors on this list provide superb color accuracy. They back it up with a wide range of on-screen menu options that allow color and general image-quality customization. This helps a video editor dial in the monitor&rsquo;s color accuracy and eliminate any small errors they notice.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="4k-is-the-standard">4K is the standard</h3>



<p>4K resolution is the gold standard for video editing among an extremely broad range of video editing projects, from Hollywood films to YouTube videos. Most video editors will rarely need to support a resolution beyond 4K.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s technically possible to edit a video for 4K on a monitor with sub-4K resolution. This is especially true of less &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; content, such as video created for YouTube or social media. Still, 4K is preferable since it offers a 1:1 representation of the final cut.</p>



<h3 id="great-hdr-is-ideal-but-hard-to-find">Great HDR is ideal, but hard to find</h3>



<p>High Dynamic Range (HDR) video is now rather common. Many devices, from smartphones to laptops and televisions, can display HDR content. That makes HDR alluring for video editors. Unfortunately, great HDR monitors are hard to find, and the best are very expensive.</p>



<p>All the monitors on this list can support HDR, which technically means it&rsquo;s possible to use them for HDR video editing. Odds are you&rsquo;ll have no problem editing HDR video for less-demanding platforms, like YouTube and social media, on any monitor listed here. However, the pricey Asus ProArt PA32DC is the only monitor on this list that holds up if you need to guarantee brilliant, accurate HDR results.</p>



<h3 id="usb-c-is-a-handy-perk">USB-C is a handy perk</h3>



<p>USB-C has evolved into an excellent connection option that&rsquo;s well suited to video editing. A single USB-C port can handle both Power Delivery and DisplayPort Alternate Mode. A monitor with a USB-C port that supports these features effectively doubles as a USB-C. hub, reducing clutter on a desk. It&rsquo;s ideal for video editors who often use a USB-C compatible laptop to travel to, and edit at, remote worksites.</p>



<p>All the monitors on this list have a USB-C port with Power Delivery and DisplayPort Alternate Mode, though the amount of power and number of downstream ports varies. Dell&rsquo;s U3223QE is the standout choice for connectivity, as it offers ethernet and DisplayPort-out in addition to multiple USB-A ports. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="how-we-test-monitors">How we test monitors</h2>



<p>PCWorld&rsquo;s monitor reviews are written by staff and freelance writers. Monitors are tested with the SpyderXElite color calibration tool to objectively measure brightness, contrast, color gamut, and color accuracy, among other metrics. Objective measurements let us directly compare dozens of monitors at once.</p>



<p>Our testing also accounts for special features that may give a monitor an advantage. A USB-C hub with extensive connectivity and Power Delivery is always preferable. We also like to see ergonomic stands, numerous video inputs, a wide range of on-screen menu options, and HDR support.</p>

<p>The Asus ROG Strix X670-E Gaming WiFi comes in at an MSRP of $499, pricing it above its X570 predecessor. It also has a plethora of next-generation features such as PCIe Gen 5, so there&rsquo;s a lot to be excited about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the basic specs you&rsquo;re getting, and we&rsquo;ll also go over the most vital inclusions that will enhance your everyday use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>X670-E denotes the &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; nature of these motherboards&mdash;with more available PCIe lanes compared to the cheaper B650 models. You&rsquo;ll need an entirely new Ryzen 7000 CPU to go along with this new chipset, so keep that in mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the box, you&rsquo;ll get your usual SATA cables and WiFi antenna, but some nice ROG extras, too. A ROG Strix sticker, keychain, and even a graphics card holder! (We&rsquo;re looking at you, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">Nvidia RTX 4090!)</a>&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>ATX form factor&nbsp;</li><li>Support for Ryzen 7000 CPUs&nbsp;</li><li>18+2 Teamed Power Stages, with 110A per stage</li><li>DDR5 RAM&nbsp;</li><li>2x PCIe Gen 5.0 16x slots (plus an additional Gen 4 16x)</li><li>4x onboard M.2 slots, (2x being PCIe Gen 5)&nbsp;</li><li>HDMI and DisplayPort out</li><li>13 USB ports on back, including a USB 3.2 Gen 2&times;2&nbsp;</li><li>Intel Wi-Fi 6E&nbsp;</li><li>Intel 2.5GbE LAN</li><li>RGB Aura Sync header</li><li>4 SATA 6Gb/s ports&nbsp;</li><li>8 PWM fan headers&nbsp;</li><li>BIOS Flashback and Clear CMOS&nbsp;</li><li>Onboard power button</li><li>Audio: ROG SupremeFX 7.1 with ALC4080 Codec&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Compatible AM4 CPU cooler mounting (that use original AMD backplate design)</li><li>Asus Q-Release and Q-Latch</li><li>MSRP $499</li></ul><h2 id="asus-rog-strix-x670-e-gaming-wifi-features">Asus ROG Strix X670-E Gaming WiFi: Features</h2>



<p>The Asus ROG Strix is perfectly paired with a sweet gaming PC build&mdash;well optimized for everything a gamer could want. While it does not have some of the fastest I/O (such as USB 4) that some content creators may want, it does provide more than enough for most.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first big feature upgrade you&rsquo;ll get here is PCIe Gen 5, allowing for much faster speeds. Four onboard M.2 slots allow you to take advantage of this boost, with two being PCIe Gen 5. Modern GPUs like the RTX 4090 still top out at PCIe Gen 4 speeds, so you&rsquo;ll be more than covered here. The X670-E chipset makes sure you have a healthy dose of PCIe lanes at your disposal, allowing it to handle your GPU, M.2 drives, and add-on cards without saturating all the PCIe lanes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll get the awesome Q-Release button for your GPU&rsquo;s 16x PCIe slot, too. Press it and your GPU pops out like magic! Similarly, Q-Latch is also available on the M.2 drive slots, allowing for easy-as-pie toolless access. They&rsquo;re also nicely cooled with the heatsinks and thermal pads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To top off the storage, you&rsquo;ll get four SATA ports for hard drives. For workstation users or content creators who need more, you may have to upgrade to the next tier up such as the Hero.</p>

</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>DDR5 is finally on AMD&rsquo;s platform as well, with generously fast speeds supported out of the box. With DDR5 prices steadily decreasing, and faster kits coming out, it makes for a much easier transition.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix X670-E Gaming WiFi" class="wp-image-1384312" height="669" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-10-29-at-1.27.18-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>With 13 USB ports you can plug in all your gaming accessories&mdash;and more! Plus, they&rsquo;re plenty-fast for storage transfers, too. You don&rsquo;t get Thunderbolt 4 or the latest USB 4 here, however. You&rsquo;ll have to step up to a more expensive motherboard to get these options if you&rsquo;re in need of the absolute fastest standards.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix X670-E Gaming WiFi" class="wp-image-1384315" height="770" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-10-29-at-1.28.36-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Audio connectivity is great, with the ROG SupremeFX ALC4080 Codec and generous audio outputs on the back.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll need a way to download your games, right? Intel&rsquo;s 2.5GbE and 6E Wi-Fi are here, which should be more than enough for any gamer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rounding off with some nice-to-have overclocking goodies, you get a start button, clear CMOS, and BIOS flash, too. Even if you&rsquo;re not overclocking, these can often come in handy when troubleshooting or doing maintenance to your build.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another nice feature&mdash;the Ryzen 7000 CPUs will now give you an integrated GPU with HDMI and DisplayPort out. While you may not want to game on this, it can be a life saver when you&rsquo;re diagnosing a system problem.</p>



<h2 id="asus-rog-strix-x670-e-gaming-wifi-design">Asus ROG Strix X670-E Gaming WiFi: Design</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix X670-E Gaming WiFi" class="wp-image-1384319" height="715" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-10-29-at-1.30.17-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Some nice gaming design features on the Asus ROG Strix X670-E Gaming WiFi make it worthy of any plexiglass display.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The $499 MSRP ROG Strox X670-E certainly comes packing the quality to justify the price. Hefty and well built, with quality materials used throughout. No, it doesn&rsquo;t come with a beefy backplate like its bigger Z790 Hero brother, but it&rsquo;s still well made.</p>



<p>The real star of the show is the wonderful &ldquo;Strix&rdquo; design of the motherboard itself&mdash;full of interesting touches, and brimming with character and playfulness. Angular design cues keep it somewhat serious, to hint at the performance under the hood.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The I/O shroud on the upper-left area has awesome things going on, too. You can customize the RGB here, adding some colorful touches to the design.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix X670-E Gaming WiFi" class="wp-image-1384320" height="679" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-10-29-at-1.29.03-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Nice RGB touches on the I/O shield included with the Asus ROG Strix X670-E Gaming WiFi.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The rest of the bottom PCIe area look great, with some silver accents on the slots and Strix branding prominently displayed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, continuing the business end of the design, the VRM area looks great too, with imposing elements protruding out. The Q-Code display for diagnostic reading is also a nice touch. Overall, nice design aesthetics make it look good when peeking out of your tempered-glass PC build!</p>



<h2 id="asus-rog-strix-x670-e-gaming-wifi-performance-software-and-bios">Asus ROG Strix X670-E Gaming WiFi: Performance, software, and BIOS</h2>



<p>Asus gives us 18+2 power stages, with its &ldquo;Teamed Power Stage Design&rdquo;&mdash;translation: You can strap even the Ryzen 9 7950X to this and it will handle it with ease. Anything less will be a cakewalk, too! This motherboard is likely best paired with the Ryzen 7600X, 7700X, or the 7900X. These are more &ldquo;gamer&rdquo;-focused CPUs; most won&rsquo;t really make use of the monster cores on the 7950X (which might be more at home with content creators on something like the X670E ROG Hero or Extreme.)</p>



<p>Performance in all other areas is at light-speed levels here, too. PCIe Gen 5 allows for more than enough overhead, as most devices have barely caught up to PCIe Gen 4 yet. Your GPU and M.2 drives will be more than happy calling this Strix their home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DDR5 is here too, allowing very fast and stable speeds across the board. As more kits are released, the gap between DDR4 and DDR5 will slowly start to increase as time goes on&mdash;and the Strix is fully equipped to handle it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Asus BIOS returns here with its great ease-of-use (if you&rsquo;re up to tinkering with that DDR5 RAM). For those who prefer to let the motherboard do the heavy lifting, the BIOS is full of great automatic profiles for your DDR5 RAM and Ai overclocking for your CPU. Those who want to dig further are given the tools to do so, with robust overclocking settings available. (Many users might want to adjust voltage or optimize their Ryzen 7000 CPUs, which can draw some big power numbers but be tamed with some Eco Mode-style tinkering.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asus Armoury Crate software has also been transformed into a &ldquo;jack-of-all-trades&rdquo; solution. It does a great job at adjusting your fan curves, and the most important part of all: Aura Sync RGB goodness. Here you can change colors and profiles for the motherboard, customize the I/O shroud area, plus set your synced RGB devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, it can also find appropriate software driver updates, too. Motherboard software has historically not been the best optimized, but Asus is certainly doing a valiant effort with the Armoury Create Suite.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-asus-rog-strix-x670-e-gaming-wifi">Should you buy the Asus ROG Strix X670-E Gaming WiFi?</h2>



<p>The Asus ROG Strix X670-E Gaming WiFi brings the Strix family into the modern age, with fantastic features for gamers. It has increased in price to an MSRP of $499 from the previous generation, like so much hardware recently. There&rsquo;s a lot of added tech, however. PCIe Gen 5, DDR5, all translate to next-generation performance, and allows for generous M.2 usage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Content creators and workstation users may be better served by upgrading to the next tier over, such as the Hero lineup. That will offer faster I/O such as USB 4 and more SATA ports, if those matter to you. Otherwise, the Strix has more than enough USB and gaming-centric features to satisfy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being well-built and with an appealing design, it&rsquo;s a great entry point into the &ldquo;ROG&rdquo; enthusiast motherboards. It streamlines the features that are most useful for its biggest fans: gamers.&nbsp;</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Streaming services are getting more expensive, and it doesn&rsquo;t help that it seems like all the good stuff is spreading out a lot more. If you&rsquo;re feeling the cable-style pinch of increasing prices and ever-expanding subscriptions, you should check out this deal on Hulu. You can get access to the service&rsquo;s entire library of ad-supported streaming TV and movies <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.kmtrak.com/NL5B25/3HWS9F7/?uid=713&amp;xcust=2-2-1388107-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">for just $1.99 a month</a>! </p>



<p>This deal is available if you&rsquo;re a new subscriber, or if you&rsquo;ve subscribed before and canceled more than a month ago. Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t apply this discounted to an upgraded plan, either removing ads or adding live television streaming. But if you&rsquo;re already subscribed to Hulu, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://slickdeals.net/f/15799315-select-existing-hulu-subscribers-add-disney-subscription-3-mo&amp;xcust=2-2-1388107-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">you can add Disney+ on top for $2.99 a month</a>. (Hulu is now majorly owned by Disney &mdash; hooray for corporate consolidation!) This works even if you use it <em>after </em>subscribing to Hulu through the $1.99 a month deal, giving you both libraries for about five bucks a month. Nice. </p>



<p>This deal works as a standard subscription discount, so unfortunately you can&rsquo;t just pay for a year upfront. And if you should cancel or change your subscription status, the discount goes away. So before signing up, you need to be pretty okay with ad breaks in your movies and TV shows. Paying just $2 per month makes them a lot more tolerable!</p>
