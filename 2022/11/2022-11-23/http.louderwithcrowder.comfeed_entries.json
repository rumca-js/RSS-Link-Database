One, The White Stripes frontman Jack Whitte is the latest celebrity you've forgotten about to make a big dramatic exit from Twitter. White went on a lengthy anti-Elon Musk rant via his Instagram Page:</p><blockquote>Why don't you be truthful? Tell it like it is; people like you and Joe Rogan (who gives platforms to liars<br />like Alex Jones etc.); you come into a ton of money, see the tax bill, despise paying your fair share, and then<br />think moving to Texas and supporting whatever republican you can is going to help you keep more of your<br />money. </blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1ee58\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32180171&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>Since Jack White dislikes people who have opposing viewpoints from him, you know he's going to hate having someone like Tulsi Gabbard, who made news in 2022 for leaving the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tulsi-gabbard-leaving-democratic-party\" target=\"_self\">anti-science party of hatred and intolerance known as the Democratic Party</a>, playing one of his tunes.</p><p>The other reason is that it's Thanksgiving Eve, and we should all be thankful for our friends. Thank you Jocko and Tulsi for reminding America of that.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
