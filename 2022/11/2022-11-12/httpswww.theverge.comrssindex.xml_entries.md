  <p id="ybJcVT">FTX moved users’ funds to offline wallets early Saturday morning after a wave of “unauthorized transactions” drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the beleaguered cryptocurrency exchange. Ryne Miller, the general counsel at FTX US, didn’t confirm a hack, but <a href="https://twitter.com/_Ryne_Miller/status/1591281729125613570?s=20&amp;t=GJkQJUAMTY_-bC0pBmXmsA">said on Twitter</a> that the company made the move to “mitigate damage” caused by the potential theft, as transferring funds offline, or to “cold storage,” helps prevents outsiders from gaining access to them.</p>
<p id="gfHJKp">The millions in funds evaporated from the platform shortly after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/11/23453164/ftx-bankruptcy-filing-sam-bankman-fried-resigns">FTX filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on Friday</a>, affecting the domestic FTX US trading platform, the global version of FTX, and Alameda Research.

  <p id="LwTjzI">Republicans predicted a “red wave” that would crush any hopes of a Democratic majority this election cycle. But as the dust settles and vote counts wrap up, that prediction has shattered. </p>
<p id="mDzZOL">While Republicans saw success in states like Florida and New York, Democrats fared better in battleground states, where polls often significantly underestimated their support. On the eve of the election, <em>FiveThirtyEight</em>’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/">poll average had Dr. Mehmet Oz ahead by just half a point</a>, only to see him lose by 4 percent in the final tally.
