At club nights and parties, local DJs and producers mix up traditional guitarra and samples from old fado classics with the music of the Afro-Lusophone diaspora, such as semba, Cape Verdean morna and the 80s electronic-geared kizomba, finding links with Afrobeats, Brazilian genres such as samba and the contemporary skitter of US trap.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/12/one-to-watch-ana-moura-casa-guilhermina-novo-fado\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/12/bruce-springsteen-only-the-strong-survive-review-the-boss-plays-it-safe", "title": "Bruce Springsteen: Only the Strong Survive review \u2013 the Boss plays it safe", "date_published": "2022-11-12 14:00:42+00:00", "description": "<p>(Columbia) <br />This new album of old soul covers is warm and enjoyable, but leaves you wishing it had gone a little deeper</p><p>The album\u2019s title is, of course, mostly bluster.

Springsteen and his long-time producer Ron Aniello, who, in the absence of most of the E Street Band, plays the majority of the instruments, add oomph in the form of thrumming organ, a cadre of balmy backing vocalists and the E Street horns. You can hear Springsteen chuckling ruefully in the intro.
