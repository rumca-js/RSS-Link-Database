I didn't know (or care) why. But as is the case when you spend too much time on Twitter, you find out anyway. Elizabeth Warren was trending because some rando bluecheckmark freaked out on Elon Musk referring to Elizabeth Warren as "Karen."</p><blockquote>BREAKING: Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, disrespectfully called Senator Warren "Senator Karen" and said she reminds him of an "angry mom" after she proposed fixing the rigged tax code to tax billionaries like him.

<p>Back to the progressive dinkus so desperate for an anti-Elon Tweet, she went back to December like her name was Taylor "Karen" Swift. Can you really not find ANYTHING more recent to attack Elon on?</p><p>The dude's been on Twitter quite a bit lately saying all sorts of things. His endorsement of all Republicans in the midterms might work for mockery. RT IF YOU THINK ERICA MARSH IS A HARDO KAREN.</p><p><p>

## British man declares he's no longer a Korean woman, blames gender ideology in schools and Harry Styles

Then the British influencer decided he was a Korean woman and spent a lot of money on plastic surgery to live her best life. Now, she has decided she's a man again, and he is blaming American schools and Harry Styles. With apologies to the AP Styleguide and Meta's community guidelines, I am unclear what is the "proper" pronoun. Please accept that my heart is in the right place.</p><p>Let's take a jump back to February when we first found out Oli -- or "Jimin" - was transitioning to Korean. He (he was still a he then) <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/korean-influencer-surgery" target="_blank">spent over $250,000</a> to live his best Korean life. That <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/transracial-spends-250k-to-look-korean-plans-penis-reduction-why-do-people-get-so-offended" target="_blank">included a penis reduction</a> so that he -- and these are his words -- would be more authentically Korean.</p><blockquote>I don't want people to get offended by this, but in Korea, [the average] penis is like 3.5 inches, and I get trolled all the time. People say, 'Oh, you can't be Korean. You're not 100 percent Korean,' and I just want to be 100 percent Korean," London told Newsweek in January. "I would even have a penis reduction so I'm, like, the Korean average. That's how far I'm willing to go. I can have it done in Thailand, and it will cost between $6,000 and $8,000.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>At some point between our last report <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11419455/Oli-London-says-transitioning-Korean-woman-British-man.html" target="_blank">and this Tucker Carlson interview</a>, Jimin decided he was a Korean woman. I'm not sure when exactly. It's been a long year. It's also a moot point because Jimin is now Oli and she is now he. Oli blames the whole ordeal on the American school system. That Oli was never a part of. Because he/she is British/Korean.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Oli London: "Is there any wonder ... young people want to change their gender when we have the normalization of this in our schools?" <a href="https://t.co/Wnv4bi4sdF">pic.twitter.com/Wnv4bi4sdF</a><br />‚Äî The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) <a href="https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1591245692072497153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>Children are taught from a young age, from the age of five in some cases, that it's okay to change their gender, it's okay to wear a skirt, and it's okay for a boy to use the gender-neutral toilet when it puts girls at risk.<br /><br />This is the new norm and schools are teaching about toxic masculinity, they're eroding the alpha male,' London told Carlson. 'The alpha straight male has been eroded. What happened years ago when kids used to idolize Superman and astronauts? [Now] they're taught to idolize weak men like Harry Styles. Weak men like Beto O'Rourke.<br /></blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Here's the thing. The words that are coming out Oli's mouth now, make a lot of sense. They are accurate. Oli is saying things we tend to agree with here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website. If we were talking about a seventeen-year-old feeling as if they were bullied and peer pressured into making life-altering changes, it would be a different story.</p><p>But you're going to have to forgive me for wondering how much a 31-year-old British man was influenced by a public school system that they have been out of for over a decade. I bet he can't name a single Harry Styles song or a single of political race Beto failed at either</p><p>It's almost as if this "influencer" is saying words for no other reason than to get on television and get people to pay attention to him. Unless you are pointing and laughing at his now below-average-sized penis he paid to surgically make below-average, we may want to ignore this one,</p><p><p>

We love our coal miner.</blockquote><p>Coach Calipari made sure Michael, Mollie, and their son get the full VIP treatment. One single touching moment captured on the bird app shows us the importance of family, of fathers and sons, and that in the words of one of the greatest poets of this generation Adam Lazzara, "These are the days. Always remember."</p><p><p>
