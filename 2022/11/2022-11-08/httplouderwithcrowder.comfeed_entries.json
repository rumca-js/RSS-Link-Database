TikTok is called by critics \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tiktok-andrew-schulz-app\" target=\"_blank\">worthless to society</a>\" and if you read the terms of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tiktok-joe-rogan\" target=\"_blank\">service, China owns all of your data</a>. If you choose to use it anyway, that's on you. But it's odd that elected American officials would encourage usage of an app that sends all your personal data to Communist China.</p><p>What is also unclear is why all Democrat TikToks need to reach ungodly levels of cringe. It's as if you have to take a cringe test before making a political video, and if you don't score at least 85% in cringe the app disables itself. Citizen journalist Libs of TikTok compiled the cringiest of the cringe. Either there is a hidden zoomer vote we're about to be surprised within the next few hours, or you all need to be ashamed of yourselves.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">CRINGE COMPILATION! <br /><br />All the politicians and activists who took to TikTok to appeal for votes: <br /><br />Watch till end! <a href=\"https://t.co/C3MfPwUoFc\">pic.twitter.com/C3MfPwUoFc</a><br />\u2014 Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1589841744388329473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 8, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Karine Jean Pierre was asked about the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tik-tok-influencer-lashes-out\" target=\"_blank\">White House's excessive use</a> of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-ulta-biden\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok influencers</a> using Communist China run app (that collects all our data for China) to help promote the president's message.
