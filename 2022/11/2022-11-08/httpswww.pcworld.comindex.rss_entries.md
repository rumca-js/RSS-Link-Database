## Microsoft is going to clamp down on your OneDrive data cap

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Microsoft is placing additional limits on the amount of data you can store in OneDrive, beginning in February of next year, and removing a significant anonymity feature shortly thereafter.</p>



<p>According to an email sent to users, Microsoft will begin counting attachments linked to your Outlook.com address against your data cap beginning February 1, 2023. (A copy of the email was forwarded to PCWorld by an outside representative of Microsoft, and referenced earlier by Windows Central.) That means that whatever attachments you have stored in your existing inbox <em>haven&rsquo;t</em> counted as stored files until now, but will beginning in February of next year.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This update will not impact your Outlook.com mailbox storage amount,&rdquo; Microsoft wrote. &ldquo;However, this may reduce how much cloud storage you have available to use with your OneDrive. If you reach your cloud storage quota, your ability to send and receive emails in Outlook.com will be disrupted.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Outlook.com only allows a maximum of 20MB of files to be attached to an email, so it&rsquo;s unlikely your email has a ton of attachments waiting to count against your cap. Go beyond that, and Microsoft encourages you to simply share a link to the file that you have stored in OneDrive, instead.</p>



<p>By default, Microsoft provides <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/439938/onedrive-goes-to-a-terabyte.html">a terabyte of storage with every paid Microsoft 365 account</a>, though users have the option to pay for additional storage, too. While <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3596132/how-googles-new-policy-affects-your-free-storage-in-photos-and-drive.html">Google made headlines</a> by counting virtually every file stored in its cloud against your data cap, Microsoft does much the same thing&mdash;your photos may be accessed via the Photos or OneDrive app, for example, but they&rsquo;re already counted against your cap. (You can also <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393993/fight-googles-data-cap-with-a-simple-change-to-google-photos.html">tweak Google Photos to help reduce your data cap</a> within that service, too.) What Microsoft apparently hasn&rsquo;t done is count generic Outlook.com email against the cap, yet.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s another change worth knowing about, too. It&rsquo;s likely that you don&rsquo;t know about the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-or-remove-an-email-alias-in-outlook-com-459b1989-356d-40fa-a689-8f285b13f1f2&amp;xcust=2-1-1374270-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">email aliases that you can create within Outlook.com</a>, which is probably why Microsoft is discontinuing them. But they&rsquo;re a handy feature: While you&rsquo;ll use the same email inbox, password, account settings, and contacts as your &ldquo;real&rdquo; email account, you can create a separate alias to preserve anonymity. Outlook (the email client) allows you to see email sent specifically to that email at Outlook.com (the email service). The alias can then be removed whenever you like&mdash;though doing so &ldquo;deletes&rdquo; it, permanently.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that handy alias feature is being turned off in about a year&rsquo;s time, on November 30, 2023. But it&rsquo;s not all bad&mdash;only the ability to create <em>new</em> aliases is being removed in a year&rsquo;s time. If you want to create one before then, you can, and it will still work after the cutoff date. It might be worth creating a few aliases before then, just to try it out and have an additional option when it goes dark.</p>

## Zoom debuts Zoom Spots, your forever Zoom meeting

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Zoom&mdash;the simple, straightforward video platform we all came to know over the last few years&mdash;now wants to expand its reach by adding email and &ldquo;coworking,&rdquo; too. </p>



<p>Yes, you heard that right. Now in addition to Microsoft Office / Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and the dozens of other various services we use to share information (and forget <em>where</em> that particular, necessary bit of information was shared), Zoom wants in on the mix.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s all part of Zoom One, the centralized Zoom service that already offers chat services, a shared whiteboard, dedicated chat rooms, and more. Zoom said Tuesday that it&rsquo;s combining both in-meeting chats as well as &ldquo;offline&rdquo; chats into a single chat interface. </p>



<p>Zoom Spots, meanwhile, sounds very much like a perpetual Zoom call. &ldquo;Coming in early 2023, Zoom Spots is Zoom&rsquo;s virtual coworking space,&rdquo; the company said in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.zoom.us/platform-enhancements-zoomtopia-2022/&amp;xcust=2-1-1374246-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> accompanying Zoomtopia 2022, its annual conference. &ldquo;It is designed to foster inclusive discussions, bringing the fluid interactions of in-person work to distributed, hybrid teams throughout their work day. Zoom Spots replicates the &lsquo;working alongside&rsquo; aspect of an open office for workers and encourages free-form video-first conversations.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Zoom&rsquo;s concept art of Zoom Spots, below, is very bare-bones, with no indication that you can actually ever <em>leave</em> the Zoom Spot. It does appear that you can turn off your mic and camera, but sometimes the whole point of working is to be able to tune out co-workers, focus on the task at hand, and get things done. It&rsquo;s not clear that Zoom understands this.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Zoom Spots" class="wp-image-1374261" height="883" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Zoom-Spots.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Zoom Spots.</figcaption></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.zoom.us/platform-enhancements-zoomtopia-2022/&amp;xcust=2-1-1374246-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Zoom</a></div>



<p>Fortunately it&rsquo;s not quite as bad as it all sounds. While Zoom is adding Zoom Mail and Zoom Calendar&mdash;apps that would seemingly replicate apps you already use&mdash;Zoom <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> saying that you have to use its own email services. (Although if you do, Zoom will encrypt the email from end to end, providing additional security.) This means that there&rsquo;s at least hope that you&rsquo;ll be able to continue using your own existing email services and simply use the Zoom Mail and Calendar apps to sync data that is processed elsewhere.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Zoom email" class="wp-image-1374262" height="929" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Zoom-email.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Zoom Mail, yet another email client.</figcaption></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.zoom.us/platform-enhancements-zoomtopia-2022/&amp;xcust=2-1-1374246-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Zoom</a></div>



<p>The challenge, however, is that as more services beef up their office suites, making them &ldquo;stickier,&rdquo; it can become trickier to monitor and hunt down a particular piece of information. That may not be a concern to Zoom. But as a user, how many more apps do we need that try and do it all?</p>

## Microsoft Create mixes business with pleasure

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Even if you&rsquo;re a hardcore Microsoft 365 / Office subscriber, chances are that you don&rsquo;t take advantage of all of the services that Microsoft offers you. A new portal, Microsoft Create, is designed to encourage you to do just that.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://create.microsoft.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1374192-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Create</a>, which is being launched in preview, is simply a gateway to services Microsoft already provides: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Forms, and Clipchamp, the new video editing service. It also provides an entry point to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1346579/microsoft-will-bring-ai-art-to-windows-edge.html">Microsoft Designer, the new AI-powered creative tool</a> that Microsoft has announced but hasn&rsquo;t formally launched. </p>



<p>Why use Create? In a word, templates. Microsoft&rsquo;s Office apps, as well as Clipchamp, all begin with quick, purposeful ways to accomplish tasks, and that&rsquo;s the whole point of Create. The site offers a search box right at the top of the page to get started, but also has visual representations of various templates further down to provide further inspiration. All of the templates are fully customizable, so that you can tweak them as you wish.</p>



<p>Suggested project templates include a TikTok video, an animated or static birthday card, and more. There&rsquo;s even a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://create.microsoft.com/en-us/learn?utm_source=off_ins&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=preview&amp;xcust=2-1-1374192-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"><strong>Learn &amp; grow section of Create</strong></a> that offers suggestions and tips from content creators to help propel you even further.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s a final reason to use Create: because it&rsquo;s create-ive. So much of Microsoft 365 / Office seems designed for business, simply to improve your workflow and help you and your business make money. Much of the creative elements within Office and Windows seem to have been neglected over the recent years. Create helps restore that feeling of fun.</p>

## Ads invade the Windows 11 Start Menu

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Far be it from us to criticize a little advertising &mdash; after all, it&rsquo;s what keeps the lights on at this site, and pretty much every similar one around the web. But users who buy a computer and, by extension, a $100-plus copy of Windows from Microsoft are on firmer ground for complaint. For example, the latest place Microsoft wants to experiment with a little add-on-advertisement is the Windows 11 Start Menu, specifically the flyout menu you see when you click on your user profile picture. </p>



<p>As spotted by Twitter user Albacore (and elaborated by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-is-now-pushing-ads-and-promos-in-windows-11-start-menu-but-you-can-disable-them/&amp;xcust=2-1-1373805-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NeoWin</a>), at least some users of the latest Dev Channel version of Windows 11 are seeing little promo spots for Microsoft OneDrive and creating new Microsoft Accounts in this sub-menu. It&rsquo;s not especially surprising, or even that bad as advertising goes, but it&rsquo;s one more example of Microsoft treating Windows as an ad platform for its other services. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Ask the internet if you should wait until Black Friday to upgrade your PC, and you&rsquo;ll get a stream of comments dismissing it as a time for good deals.</p>



<p>They&rsquo;re not wrong, but they&rsquo;re not right, either. Sure, if you&rsquo;ve got your eye on a very specific part, your chances of a deep discount are generally a toss-up. It can be as likely you&rsquo;ll get a better price at another time of the year as you will during Black Friday. The more niche it is, the rougher your odds.</p>



<p>But if all you care about is price and are semi-flexible on features for your components, you can chain together Black Friday deals for ultimate savings. In fact, you can go the full distance and build an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1371948/black-friday-2021-deals-the-cheapest-gaming-pc-you-can-build.html">entire budget PC for stupid cheap</a>.</p>



<p>So which way should you go?&nbsp;Since the situation gets pretty confusing during the early weeks of November (when everything&rsquo;s on sale but it&rsquo;s not clear what&rsquo;s an actual bargain), I put together some general guidelines to help. These should allow you to strike a good balance between sweet savings and waiting indefinitely for a discount that may never come.</p>



<h2 id="black-friday-2022-what-to-buy-now-what-to-wait-for">Black Friday 2022: What to buy now, what to wait for</h2>

</div></figure><p>Below is my advice for the most common PC parts that people upgrade, tailored specifically for Black Friday 2022. Current supply and demand issues are incorporated into the advice.</p>



<p>For components not covered on this list, you can hone your own ability to figure out sales trends (and just how to spot deals) by following the advice in our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3318296/black-friday/black-friday-everything-you-need-to-know.html">Black Friday FAQ</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Let us help you:</strong>&nbsp;If you do decide to wait for Black Friday deals, we&rsquo;ll be tracking the best prices on PC parts during Black Friday, both in the lead-up and the week of.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="The Ryzen 7 5800X3D lying on a wooden box" class="wp-image-633666" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DSCF1147_Final.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>



<p><strong>Buy.</strong> New processors like AMD Ryzen 7000 and Intel 13th-gen Raptor Lake won&rsquo;t enjoy any price cuts yet; they&rsquo;re too new. Meanwhile, AMD&rsquo;s last-gen processors are hitting their lowest prices ever. If you see a steep drop on a chip you want, grab it now. We suspect that AMD Ryzen 5000 chips (in particular, the 5600G, 5700G, 5600X, and 5800X, though we&rsquo;ve seen sweet discounts on the 5800X3D and even 5900X) may come in and out of availability at fire-sale prices over the course of November, but there&rsquo;s no guarantee you&rsquo;ll be able to pick one up at such prices indefinitely. Get your gear while the getting is good.</p>



<h2 id="cpu-coolers">CPU Coolers</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/04/2g_ryzen_7_17-100755308-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="2g ryzen 7 17 Ryzen 2" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/04/2g_ryzen_7_17-100755308-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption><p>The likelihood of scoring a discount on a Wraith Prism cooler is very low.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p><strong>Toss-up.</strong> If you absolutely must get a cooler for as low as possible, the week of Black Friday does offer better discounts on both air and closed-loop models. (Though typically, the price drops are bigger on the liquid coolers.) Previous years generally offered an extra $10 to $20 in savings, but there was never a guarantee that specific models would get a price drop.</p>



<p>Typically most discounts that spring up over the year are decent, so if the model you want is on sale before Black Friday proper (especially if at an all-time low), go for it.</p>



<h2 id="motherboards">Motherboards</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/02/motherboard-intel-biostar-100748993-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="motherboard intel biostar" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/02/motherboard-intel-biostar-100748993-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption><p>Need just a motherboard? You can skip waiting for a Black Friday sale.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p><strong>Buy.</strong> Because many builders have brand loyalties, specific features they want, <em>and </em>additional form factor requirements, getting a killer bargain on your motherboard of choice can be like waiting to win the lottery.</p>



<p>Exception: If you&rsquo;re buying a CPU too, you might want to wait. That gives you the opportunity to score a deal on the CPU, and possibly also an additional combo or bundle discount. It also pays to wait if you&rsquo;re flexible with your motherboard requirements. Just be prepared to abandon any hope of keeping to a particular aesthetic.</p>



<h2 id="gpu">GPU</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/10/dsc01106-100860558-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="dsc01106" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/10/dsc01106-100860558-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption><p>The GPU landscape is so different than last year, but your buying experience will depend on what models you&rsquo;re targeting.</p> </figcaption></figure></div>




<p><strong>Toss-up.</strong> Graphics cards have been plummeting in price, but the discounts haven&rsquo;t applied equally across the board. (In fact, some of the downward swing we saw in October seems to have reversed some in November, depending on which model we&rsquo;re talking about.) The sweet spot seems to be the high-end Radeon 6000 series cards (some versions of the $1,000 6900XT currently sit between $650 to $700!), but you can find deals on other Radeon cards and some mid-range Nvidia GPUs, too. Don&rsquo;t expect additional huge cuts over the course of November, but if you&rsquo;re flexible, waiting could still pay off.</p>



<h2 id="ssd">SSD</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/09/corsair-pcie-4.0-ssd-100856413-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="corsair pcie 4.0 ssd" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/09/corsair-pcie-4.0-ssd-100856413-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption><p>SSD prices are good now, but we think they&rsquo;ll be better on Black Friday.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p><strong>Wait.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Prices are good right now, but if Amazon&rsquo;s recent Prime Day discounts were any clue, we&rsquo;ll see even better prices across capacities (including 2TB!), form factors, and interfaces during Black Friday, or at least the week of Black Friday. The exception to this guideline is if you have a specific brand and capacity you&rsquo;re after that doesn&rsquo;t often go on sale. For those SSDs, buy as soon as the price drops by a solid amount.</span></strong></p>



<h2 id="hdd">HDD</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/02/acer_aspire_e15_m2_remove_hdd_caddy-100751030-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="acer aspire e15 m2 remove hdd caddy" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/02/acer_aspire_e15_m2_remove_hdd_caddy-100751030-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption><p>Capacity will dictate whether you should buy a hard-disk drive now or wait for Black Friday.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p><strong>Depends on capacity.</strong> Hard-disk drive prices on drives that are 2TB or smaller don&rsquo;t generally go on sale at steep discount, even during the week of Black Friday. You won&rsquo;t see a staggering difference between those deals and general sales throughout the year. Our rule of thumb is that a name-brand 1TB drive for $35 and a name-brand 2TB for $50 are good sale prices.</p>



<p>For higher-capacity drives, they rarely get sizable discounts&ndash;except for big sale days like Black Friday and even Prime Day. It can be worth seeing what discount you get during the week of the 25th. A 20-percent discount is a good deal, but take a look at sites like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.camelcamelcamel.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-402867-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Camelcamelcamel.com</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.slickdeals.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-402867-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Slickdeals.com</a> to get an idea of previous historical trends.</p>



<h2 id="ram">RAM</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/11/dom_ddr4_06-100585385-orig-100779088-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="dom ddr4 06 100585385 orig" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/11/dom_ddr4_06-100585385-orig-100779088-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption><p>Prices on DD4 RAM are great now, so while you can wait until Black Friday, you don&rsquo;t have to.</p> </figcaption></figure></div>




<p><strong>Toss-up.</strong> Prices on DDR4 memory have held stable throughout the year, but you can get further discounts during Black Friday. If you don&rsquo;t have a particular brand and type in mind, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to wait. We&rsquo;ve already spotted 32GB of non-RGB RAM for under $80, and we expect 32GB of RGB RAM to be around $100. It likely won&rsquo;t drop too much further, so you can either buy now or hold out a little longer. It just depends on your mindset and the timing of your build.</p>



<p>For DDR5 memory, it could be worth your while to wait&mdash;prices are still higher on this faster, newer memory, and it may be possible to see a return of bundle deals with Ryzen 7000 CPUs (as Micro Center offered not long ago).</p>



<h2 id="cases">Cases</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/11/template-c100.00_17_05_03.still013-100779090-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="NZXT H700 Nuka-Cola teardown" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/11/template-c100.00_17_05_03.still013-100779090-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption><p>Black Friday is a great time to catch a deal on budget cases, but you can also find discounts on select higher-end models.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p><strong>Toss-up.</strong> Not all cases go on sale, so your buying mindset determines if it&rsquo;s worth waiting or not. You can generally save a nice chunk of change by waiting if you don&rsquo;t care about brand and/or just want a super-budget case.</p>



<p>But if you want a particular model that doesn&rsquo;t often go on sale, and and it hits its last historical low (or near it), don&rsquo;t hesitate. To determine if it goes on sale often or not, check out the data available on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.camelcamelcamel.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-402867-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Camelcamelcamel.com</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.slickdeals.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-402867-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Slickdeals.com</a>. So far we haven&rsquo;t seen many eye-popping deals, but that&rsquo;s not to say one couldn&rsquo;t come before the 25th. Be ready with your spec requirements and know what you want, and that will make deciding when to buy easier.</p>



<h2 id="power-supplies">Power Supplies</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/09/power-supply-100735174-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="power supply" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/09/power-supply-100735174-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption><p>Are your only requirements for your power supply that it be as cheap as possible without blowing up on you? Then you can wait until Black Friday to purchase.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p><strong>Toss-up.</strong>&nbsp;In general, if you prefer a specific manufacturer (much less specific model), don&rsquo;t wait if you see what you want go on sale. If it&rsquo;s a good price relative to previous deals, pull the trigger.</p>



<p>But if your requirements are a little more flexible, you can save by waiting. Just be aware that power supply deals aren&rsquo;t numerous. In previous years, you saved the most on non-modular power supplies that were 550W or less, with an 80+ Bronze rating (or lower). You can also still find bargains at higher wattages, but the models that get a discount tend to completely random.</p>



<h2 id="monitors">Monitors</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/08/asus-swift-4k-monitor-100731365-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="asus swift 4k monitor" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/08/asus-swift-4k-monitor-100731365-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption><p>You can score a great deal on a monitor during Black Friday if you don&rsquo;t have strict requirements.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p><strong>Toss-up.</strong>&nbsp;Most people end up zeroing in on specific models for monitors, and in such cases, it&rsquo;s not worth passing up a good deal on what you want in the hopes it&rsquo;ll get better during Black Friday. If your research says the deal is a solid one, go for it.</p>



<p>If you instead have a set of general criteria&mdash;e.g., 1080p, 144Hz, G-Sync, 24-inches&mdash;then it can be worth your while to wait. Like cases and power supplies, the&nbsp;monitors that go on sale tend to be scattershot, and you&rsquo;ll make out best if your criteria aren&rsquo;t too rigid or tied to a particular manufacturer. Still, do your research in advance anyway, so that you have a better idea of what the best models are. We&rsquo;ve seen an increase in gaming monitor options in particular, and teasing out what&rsquo;s best for you can take a little digging.</p>



<p>When doing research (or checking out a deal), be aware that VA and IPS panels with high refresh rates are common now. You&rsquo;re no longer stuck with a TN panel if you want a 120Hz or faster display. Also, beware of vendors being sneaky about their labeling&mdash;some don&rsquo;t clearly distinguish between G-Sync and G-Sync compatible (aka FreeSync). If the price looks too cheap for actual G-Sync, it very likely is.</p>



<h2 id="final-tips">Final tips</h2>



<p>&bull; Write down the parts and the features in them that you want. Even if you have a specific component in mind, you may still find yourself wondering whether a different sale option is better. This list will make it easier to compare.</p>



<p>&bull; Cutthroat bargain hunters should have their shopping lists researched and set ASAP. Many major retailers this year are releasing their deals in waves, so forewarned is forearmed.</p>



<p>&bull; You can hedge your bets by waiting to use your PC parts and shopping strategically: That is, at stores that allow returns of unopened items, have extended return windows, don&rsquo;t charge restocking fees, <em>and</em> don&rsquo;t cost you much in shipping or gas when returning items. Just be aware that if you make too many returns at some stores, they can ban you from shopping there. So don&rsquo;t go overboard or make it a frequent habit.</p>

## LG’s luscious new OLED monitor is $1,000 cheaper, but still pricey

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Slowly, ever so slowly, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813361/best-4k-monitors.html">OLED displays are entering the PC monitor market</a>. LG was one of the first to arrive &mdash; which makes sense, since it&rsquo;s the largest maker of OLED TVs &mdash; but has so far mostly stuck to the professional graphics portion of the market. And it remains there with the latest OLED monitor, though it&rsquo;s going a little smaller and slightly more affordable. The newest OLED Ultrafine display is 27 inches and (wait for it) $2,000. Amazingly, that&rsquo;s still $1,000 cheaper than LG&rsquo;s previous 27-inch OLED. </p>



<p>The Ultrafine 27EQ850 (spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.kitguru.net/peripherals/monitors/joao-silva/lg-expands-oled-monitor-line-up-with-new-ultrafine-display/&amp;xcust=2-1-1373705-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">KitGuru</a>) shares a lot of hardware with the more expensive entries in the Ultrafine OLED series, like the identically-sized <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27ep950&amp;xcust=2-1-1373705-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">27E</a><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27ep950&amp;xcust=2-1-1373705-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">P</a><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27ep950&amp;xcust=2-1-1373705-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">950</a>. Both are 4K displays with one million-to-one contrast ratios, 60Hz refresh rates, and 99 percent coverage of the Adobe RGB and DCI-P3 range. If you&rsquo;re not a graphic designer or video editor, that means the colors are crazy-accurate. </p>



<p>But that small change in the model number gives the 27EP950 an extra 50 nits of maximum brightness, 250 versus only 200 nits on the 27EQ850. OLEDs excel at color vibrancy and contrast, but are generally weaker on pure brightness, so that 20 percent drop on the cheaper panel is a big deal. The cheaper monitor also drops support for VESA DisplayHDR&trade;400, though it hangs on to HDR10 compliance. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="lg oled ports and side profile " class="wp-image-1373783" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/lg-oled-ports-and-side-profile.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">LG</p></div>



<p>At least the less expensive option has the same excellent I/O setup, with an HDMI port, two DisplayPort, um, ports, and a USB Type-C for one-cable connection. It&rsquo;ll charge your laptop at up to 90 watts. It&rsquo;ll connect up to three USB-A gadgets and a set of headphones, too. The Ultrafine 27EQ850 is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27eq850-b#&amp;xcust=2-1-1373705-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">shipping now from LG&rsquo;s online shop</a>. </p>



<p>At the time of writing there&rsquo;s no OLED monitor on the market for less than a grand. But there might be light at the end of the tunnel: LG is hoping to get less expensive and smaller panels in the hands of its partner manufacturers <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1340351/cheaper-oled-monitors-might-be-coming-soon.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">sometime next year</a>. </p>

## MediaTek’s Dimensity 9200 phone chip wants a seat at the cool kids table

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>MediaTek has announced the Dimensity 9200, a flagship-styled smartphone chip that you&rsquo;re not buying now &mdash; but that the company hopes will eventually become as popular as others sold within phones in the United States. </p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re a fan of Chinese smartphones made by Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, and their competitors, chances are that you own a smartphone with a MediaTek Dimensity smartphone chip powering it. But the United States, sales are dominated by Apple&rsquo;s self-made iPhones, which compete with Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy lineup and the Snapdragon chips from Qualcomm. Both make it difficult for MediaTek to gain a foothold in the United States, but that hasn&rsquo;t stopped MediaTek from trying.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as to say we&rsquo;re kind of penetrating the flagship,&rdquo; said Finbarr Moynihan, MediaTek&rsquo;s vice-president of corporate marketing. &ldquo;So this is more about moving into the kind of the mid-high range in the U.S. market, I think for the near term.&rdquo;</p>



<p>But the Dimensity 9200 does offer flagship features with an eye towards the future. Four key selling points for the Dimensity 9200 include both being &ldquo;ready&rdquo; for the upcoming high-data-rate <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/616905/the-smarter-faster-less-laggy-wi-fi-7-is-on-the-horizon.html">Wi-Fi 7</a> standard, due this year, adding mmWave capability, as well as integrating hardware-based ray tracing for improved graphics. The imaging sensor also supports capturing RGBW data, which takes the red, green, and blue pixels your camera already captures and adds white to it as well.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MediaTek Dimensity 9200" class="wp-image-1373122" height="418" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Dimensity-9200-summary.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>A summary of the MediaTek Dimensity 9200 features.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">MediaTek</p></div>



<p>Overall, the Dimensity 9200 bumps up performance by 12 percent on GeekBench 5.0 on single-core performance, and 10 percent on multicore performance versus the earlier Dimensity 9000, which debuted a year ago. Overall, power consumption has dropped 25 percent, in part because of a move to TSMC&rsquo;s 4nm process and improved package cooling.</p>



<p>Since MediaTek is an Arm licensee, you&rsquo;ll see the same cores in the Dimensity 9200 as in other Arm chips: specifically the new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/796784/arm-promises-powerful-new-pcs-with-cortex-x3-immortalis-gpus.html">Cortex-X3 CPU cores and the new Immortalis GPU</a>. Specifically, the Dimensity 9200 has a single 3.05GHz Core X3, three 2.85GHz Cortex-A715s, and four 1.8GHz Cortex-A510 efficiency cores.  An Immortalis-G715 GPU with 11 cores and thrice the triangle output of its predecessor supplies the graphics.</p>



<p>The chip supports 5G (sub-6 and mmWave) as well as Bluetooth 5.3. The chip is &ldquo;ready&rdquo; for Wi-Fi 7, Moynihan said, but will have to wait for official Wi-Fi 7 certification later this year.</p>

Here, the camera is deciphering the various parts of an image and enhancing each separately.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">MediaTek</p></div>



<p>From a performance standpoint, MediaTek is claiming AnTuTu 9 performance of 1,260,000, or slightly higher than the 1,100,000 scores that accompany the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 phones, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.antutu.com/en/ranking/rank1.htm&amp;xcust=2-2-919862-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">according to the benchmark</a>.</p>



<p>Still, MediaTek is going head-to-head with an unannounced Snapdragon mobile processor that should be disclosed within a few weeks. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/556345/qualcomms-next-snapdragon-promises-always-on-smartphone-cameras.html">Last year&rsquo;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chips</a> used a Cortex-X2 prime core running at 3.0GHz, then added a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/702864/qualcomm-launches-faster-snapdragon-8-gen-1-for-premium-phones.html">Snapdragon 8+ variant</a> that upped the clock speeds to 3.2GHz. It&rsquo;s likely that a Snapdragon using the new Cortex-X3 and a version of the Immortalis is waiting in the wings. Until MediaTek can convince more phone makers to use the Dimensity series, the Snapdragons will power your next phone. </p>

It weighs just three and a half pounds, which is unusual for a gaming laptop&mdash;most gaming rigs tip the scales at around five pounds or more. The moonlight white color scheme is also swanky as hell and a nice departure from the usual aggressive black-and-red gamer aesthetic. But let&rsquo;s get right into the most important bit: the guts.</p>



<p>The Zephyrus is rocking an AMD Ryzen 7 5800HS CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of SSD storage. That&rsquo;s a powerful combination capable of playing most games at High or Ultra settings without breaking a sweat. The 14-inch display has a 1920&times;1080 resolution and a 144Hz refresh rate. According to Asus, the maximum brightness is 300 nits. </p>



<p>This is a killer deal. Gaming laptops with an RTX 3060 and a high-end Ryzen CPU inside usually go for well over a grand, especially in an overall package this svelte and sleek. Don&rsquo;t miss out.</p>

</div>


<p>Gaming laptops and professional laptops are beginning to converge, and Acer&rsquo;s Predator Triton 300 SE is one example of this trend. It&rsquo;s a large, powerful laptop with a 16-inch screen, Intel Core i7-12700H processor, and Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti graphics. Yet it delivers this hardware in a relatively slim, elegant design that weighs 5.29 pounds and packs a huge 99 watt-hour battery. The result is a portable powerhouse, though a few mistakes leave it a step behind the best in this category.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Acer Predator Triton 300 SE specs and features</strong></p>



<p>The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE I received for review was stacked with the best hardware currently listed for this model. It includes Intel&rsquo;s 14-core Core i7-12700H processor and Nvidia&rsquo;s speedy RTX 3070 Ti mobile graphics. The graphics chip is capped at a slim 115 watts of power, however, which has consequences in gaming tests.&nbsp;</p>

Its pricing, though not inexpensive, places it beneath competitors like the Razer Blade 15 and Alienware X15 R2. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.acer.com/en-us/laptops/gaming/product_series-predator_triton_300_se&amp;xcust=2-1-1370047-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Acer sells a more modest alternative configuration</a>, with an RTX 3060 GPU and just 512GB of storage, for $1,749.99.</p>



<h2 id="design-and-build-quality">Design and build quality</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE lid" class="wp-image-1370084" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/acer-predator-triton-300-se-16-inch-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Acer&rsquo;s Predator Triton 300 SE 16-inch is a simple, unassuming laptop with a silver finish and almost zero badging. In fact, the Acer brand appears nowhere on the laptop (not including the model and serial number label on the laptop&rsquo;s bottom). This sleek, clean look is meant to lure in professionals and creatives who see gaming laptops as great all-in-one machines that can handle any task thrown at them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the Predator Triton 300 SE takes its pursuit of elegance and simplicity too far. It lacks the more distinctive display lid found on the smaller <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/831493/acer-predator-triton-300-se-oled-review-a-gaming-laptop-for-content-creators.html">14-inch Predator Triton 300 SE</a>. The result is boring, unremarkable design that fails to stand out from competitors.</p>



<p>Build quality contributes to the problem. Laptops like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1064746/razer-blade-15-review-2.html">Razer Blade</a> and Apple MacBook Pro make the most of simplicity with high-quality materials that look and feel premium. The Predator Triton 300 SE uses metal panels for most exterior elements, but feels thin and flimsy when touched. Both the display lid and lower chassis allow visible flex when handled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some might consider these acceptable trade-offs for a lower price, and the Predator Triton 300 SE does significantly undercut the price of the Razer Blade 15 and Blade 17. Still, anyone considering this laptop as a less expensive Blade alternative should be wary: it certainly feels built to a budget.</p>



<h2 id="keyboard-and-trackpad">Keyboard and trackpad</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE keyboard and trackpad" class="wp-image-1370087" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/acer-predator-triton-300-se-16-inch-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The 16-inch version of the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE has plenty of space for a large keyboard. An absent numpad only improves the situation. However, the keyboard layout doesn&rsquo;t take advantage of the space. Individual keys are on the small side, leaving significant spaces between each key. Some keys on the left side, including Tab, Caps Lock, Shift, and Control, are noticeably downsized. It&rsquo;s an odd situation given the wealth of space available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A keyboard backlight is included in the model I reviewed and can be customized across three zones through Acer&rsquo;s PredatorSense software. The software is attractive and easy to use. While the keyboard backlight supports pulsing, patterns, and other dynamic lighting, Acer wisely leaves this distracting feature off by default.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The touchpad is responsive and large, measuring about five inches across and three inches deep. This is smaller than the touchpad on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1355238/corsair-voyager-a1600-review-corsairs-first-laptop-sprints-towards-victory-and-stumbles.html">Corsair&rsquo;s Voyager a1600</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/802422/the-dell-xps-17-is-a-masterful-windows-workhorse.html">Dell&rsquo;s XPS 17</a>, but still a healthy size for a gaming laptop. There&rsquo;s plenty of space to use Windows&rsquo; multi-touch gestures, which proved easy to execute in my testing.</p>



<h2 id="display-audio">Display, audio</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE display" class="wp-image-1370091" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/acer-predator-triton-300-se-16-inch-1-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Acer opts for a 2560 x 1600 IPS non-touch display for the 16-inch Predator Triton 300 SE. It also packs a 240Hz refresh rate, a maximum brightness of 500 nits, and support for both Nvidia G-Sync and Nvidia Advanced Optimus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The display&rsquo;s 16-inch size and 16:10 aspect ratio are excellent for productivity. This is a large, practical display with added vertical space that&rsquo;s handy when viewing documents, spreadsheets, or webpages. Many of Acer&rsquo;s competitors have also gone this route, so the 16:10 aspect ratio isn&rsquo;t necessarily an advantage. Still, it&rsquo;s a useful improvement over a 16:9 widescreen.</p>



<p>Gamers are sure to appreciate the display&rsquo;s 240Hz refresh rate. It offers great motion clarity when playing games with a framerate at or near 240 frames per second. Fast-moving text remains legible and interface details, like health bars, are usually distinct. Details are preserved when panning the camera, as well, making it possible to see distinct objects that would be obscured on run-of-the-mill 60Hz LCD screen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And there&rsquo;s more to the display than the refresh rate. It also supports Nvidia G-Sync for smooth frame pacing and Nvidia Advanced Optimums for improved battery life. These features aren&rsquo;t uncommon but certainly not guaranteed, so it&rsquo;s great to see both make an appearance here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet there is a downside to the display.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Image quality is merely fine. It&rsquo;s sharp, vivid, and colorful, but lacks the contrast and dark, detailed black levels available in OLED and Mini-LED displays. There&rsquo;s a big gap in quality between this 16-inch model, with its IPS LCD display, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/831493/acer-predator-triton-300-se-oled-review-a-gaming-laptop-for-content-creators.html">and its 14-inch sibling,</a> which has an OLED screen with a maximum refresh rate of 90Hz.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Upward-facing speakers are found above the Predator Triton 300 SE&rsquo;s keyboard and provide strong, clear audio that won&rsquo;t be muffled by the surface the laptop is placed on. Audio is solid with crisp, clear dialogue and a hint of bass in music. Maximum volume is high, as well, so the laptop can easily fill a home office with tunes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="webcam-microphone-biometrics">Webcam, microphone, biometrics</h2>



<p>The 16-inch Acer Predator Triton 300 SE, like the 14-inch model, has a 1080p webcam. It provides a noticeable increase in quality over a typical 720p laptop webcam. Video looks sharper and more defined, especially in good lighting. It&rsquo;s nowhere near a &ldquo;real&rdquo; DSLR or mirrorless camera, of course, but solid for a webcam.</p>



<p>I can say the same of the microphone. It picks up good volume and crisp vocals. The tinny, hollow quality of most laptops microphones remains but I found my voice easy to hear, even when I reduced a recording&rsquo;s volume significantly. That&rsquo;s a good sign.</p>



<p>A fingerprint reader is included and integrated into the touchpad surface. I&rsquo;m not a fan of this implementation, as it takes up a chunk of the touchpad&rsquo;s usable space in exchange for a mostly reliable, but sometimes inconvenient, means of biometric login. Fingerprint reading works in ideal circumstances but can&rsquo;t deal with wet, greasy, or moderately dirty fingers. I had to wipe the Cheeto dust off my fingers before I could log in.</p>



<h2 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE ports" class="wp-image-1370094" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/acer-predator-triton-300-se-16-inch-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE ports" class="wp-image-1370096" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/acer-predator-triton-300-se-16-inch-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The 16-inch Acer Predator Triton 300 SE has a single Thunderbolt 4/USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 65 watts of Power Delivery. It&rsquo;s good to see use of Thunderbolt 4 but disappointing that Acer only provides one port. Most mid-range and high-end laptops provide a pair, at the least.</p>



<p>Older devices are served by a pair of USB-A ports. The laptop also provides HDMI 2.1, a 3.5mm audio jack, and Ethernet. This is a good range of connectivity but merely whelming for a laptop priced above $2,000. I particularly dislike the lack of an SDcard reader. This comes standard on the Corsair Voyager a1600 and Razer Blade 15, among others, and it would make sense for a laptop targeting gamers and professionals simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Port location is a problem. Like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/831493/acer-predator-triton-300-se-oled-review-a-gaming-laptop-for-content-creators.html">Predator Triton 300 SE 14-inch</a>, the 16-inch places many ports near the front of the laptop. This means wired connections are obvious and take up significant desk space. Those who like a clean desk with few excess wires will find cable routing a chore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wireless connectivity offers some good news, as the laptop supports both <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/552421/wi-fi-performance-matters-more-than-you-think.html">Wi-Fi 6E</a> and Bluetooth 5.2. This provides support for modern devices and excellent Wi-Fi speeds when connected to a Wi-Fi 6E router. Wi-Fi 6 performance also seemed great in my testing, with Steam downloads hitting up to 60 megabits per second. This is close to the maximum performance I experience over Wi-Fi 6 on my home network.</p>



<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>



<p>The 16-inch Acer Predator Triton 300 SE I tested was a top-end model with an Intel Core i7-12700H processor and Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti mobile graphics. It had 16GB of DDR5 RAM and a 1TB PCIe Gen 4 solid state drive. It&rsquo;s clearly a capable system on paper, but no more so than its competitors.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE PCMark" class="wp-image-1370099" height="712" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/acer-predator-triton-300-se-16-inch-pcmark-10.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Acer turned in a disappointing score of 6,925 in PCMark 10. This is the lowest result out of a bundle of similar laptops, coming below even the Corsair Voyager a1600. On the bright side, however, the difference between the best and worst results is rather small. This gives hope that Acer could catch up in other benchmarks.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE Cinebench" class="wp-image-1370100" height="708" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/acer-predator-triton-300-se-16-inch-cinebench-r15.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Cinebench R15 validates that hope, as the Predator Triton 300 SE turns in the highest score of all similar laptops recently tested. It manages this consistently, with surprisingly modest fan noise, and in spite of a thinner profile than many competitors. It&rsquo;s an impressive result.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE Handbrake" class="wp-image-1370101" height="716" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/acer-predator-triton-300-se-16-inch-handbrake.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The good news continues in Handbrake, where the Predator Triton 300 SE comes within one second of achieving the top spot. It&rsquo;s beaten only by its larger, thicker cousin, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1070976/1070976.html">Acer Predator Helios 300</a>. Acer must be doing something right with its cooling solution, as its laptops clearly deliver better performance in sustained workloads.</p>



<p>Now we pivot to graphics performance. There&rsquo;s reason to worry the Predator Triton 300 SE won&rsquo;t be up to par, as it provides only 115 watts of power to its RTX 3070 Ti. The Predator Helios 300 and Lenovo Legion 5 Pro, by contrast, deliver 150 watts. Does it make a difference?</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE 3DMark" class="wp-image-1370102" height="698" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/acer-predator-triton-300-se-16-inch-3dmark-time-spy.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The link between power delivery and performance isn&rsquo;t immediately clear in 3DMark Time Spy, as the Predator Triton 300 SE achieves a respectable 10,289. That&rsquo;s behind the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/819461/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-2022.html">Lenovo Legion 5 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/799933/alienware-x15-r2-review-a-15-inch-gaming-laptop-stacked-with-power-and-personality.html">Alienware X15 R2</a>, but ahead of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1070976/1070976.html">Acer Predator Helios 300</a> and Razer Blade 15.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE Shadow of the Tomb Raider" class="wp-image-1370103" height="755" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/acer-predator-triton-300-se-16-inch-shadow-of-the-tomb-raider.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Acer&rsquo;s Predator Triton 300 SE begins to show weakness in <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>, as it averaged just 126 frames per second at 1080p and Highest settings. That&rsquo;s an extremely playable result, of course, but noticeably behind several similar laptops. The Acer Predator Helios 300 and Lenovo Legion 5 Pro stand out most here, as both deliver great results at slightly lower price.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE Metro Exodus" class="wp-image-1370105" height="713" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/acer-predator-triton-300-se-16-inch-metro-exodus.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s a similar story in Metro Exodus, where the Predator Triton 300 SE turns in an underwhelming average of 42 frames per second. This isn&rsquo;t too far off the pace of similar laptops, but clearly not the best possible in this price range.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also put the Predator Triton 300 SE through a few personal favorites including <em>Total War: Warhammer III</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. It maintained its relative position in these tests, providing playable results just above 60 frames per second at 1080p resolution and Ultra settings, yet running a few frames per second behind value leaders such as the Acer Predator Helios 300 and Lenovo Legion 5 Pro.</p>



<p>The Predator Triton 300 SE&rsquo;s performance results are good overall. It performs well in heavily multithreaded processor tests but lags a bit in gaming benchmarks. This may be disappointing for gamers, but it makes sense if you want a laptop for both productivity and entertainment. The Predator Triton 300 SE can handle both video editing and demanding games without much issue.</p>



<p>I also must praise the laptop&rsquo;s thermal performance. The fans are readily audible in heavy loads but never become an ear-piercing whirr. Over-the-ear headphones make the fans unnoticeable.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="battery-life">Battery life</h2>



<p>The 16-inch Acer Predator Triton 300 SE is crammed with a huge 99 watt-hour battery, the maximum typically found in a laptop due to the FAA&rsquo;s limitations on the size of lithium-ion batteries allowed in carry-on luggage.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE battery life" class="wp-image-1370107" height="733" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/acer-predator-triton-300-se-16-inch-battery-life.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Going delivers an obvious advantage for the Predator Triton 300 SE, as it lasts nearly eight hours in our standard battery test. Most gaming laptops last between four and six hours. Corsair&rsquo;s similar Voyager a1600, which also has a 99 watt-hour battery, endured less than five hours of use, while the Razer Blade 15 achieved a hair more than five hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is an important win for Acer. Gaming laptops that also target professionals and creatives often provide good performance, but it&rsquo;s too often paired with truly awful battery life. The Predator Triton 300 SE&rsquo;s battery life isn&rsquo;t amazing, but it&rsquo;s good, and that&rsquo;s enough to provide an edge.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Acer&rsquo;s 16-inch Predator Triton 300 SE ultimately delivers the same strengths and weaknesses found in many Acer gaming laptops.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s reasonably priced for the hardware on offer, scores well in most benchmarks, and delivers good battery life (for this category). It&rsquo;s a laptop that, if scored by benchmark results alone, would be easy to recommend.</p>



<p>Build quality and design is where the Predator Triton 300 SE falters. It tries to strike a professional look but lacks the material quality and rigidity of some competitors. The keyboard is a miss, with an oddly cramped layout given the laptop&rsquo;s size.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, there&rsquo;s no denying the Predator Triton 300 SE&rsquo;s overall performance and value. Gamers, professionals, and creators who want a beefy and capable machine at a more reasonable price should put it on their short list.&nbsp;</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>We need backup software for our PCs because our storage drives won&rsquo;t last forever. The best Windows backup software covers our butts when our primary drive finally up and dies.</p>



<p>It would be nice if Microsoft itself provided Windows users with something like Apple&rsquo;s Time Machine: an effective, set-it-and-forget-it, total system recovery and backup solution that requires little interaction or thought on the user&rsquo;s part.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, Microsoft delivers a mishmash of restore points, recovery discs, file backup, and even the un-retired System Backup (Windows 7), which was probably originally put out to pasture for its propensity to choke on dissimilar hardware.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407149/online-cloud-backup-services-carbonite-idrive-backblaze-livedrive.html">Online backup services</a>&nbsp;are another option, but desktop clients tend to offer far more flexibility.&nbsp;Read on for our top picks. Then head to the bottom of this article for more info about what to look for in a Windows backup program.</p>

<p>R-Drive Image has always been a favorite of ours&mdash;a low-resource-consuming product that was ultra-reliable in creating backup images of partitions and disks. But it didn&rsquo;t have as much polish as Acronis&rsquo;s backup program (below) and wasn&rsquo;t as feature-rich. That has changed with this latest version, which now has a more modern, user-friendly interface and more versatility in the types of backups you can perform. </p>

<p>Among the free programs we tested, Windows File History backup is the easiest continuous data protection software for Windows. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that the latest version removed the &ldquo;add folder&rdquo; function from File History, but otherwise it continues to improve upon an already solid backup program. Also, it provides many of the features and functions of other third-party paid backup programs, all for free. And you can&rsquo;t argue with free. Most users looking for a set-it-and-forget-it way to securely store their important data need look no further.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-test">How we test</h2>



<p>We run each program through the various types of backups it&rsquo;s capable of. This is largely to test reliability and hardware compatibility, but we time two: an approximately 115GB system image (two partitions), and a roughly 50GB image created from a set of smaller files and folders. We then mount the images and test their integrity via the program&rsquo;s restore functions. We also test the USB boot drives created by the programs.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-pick-a-backup-software">How to pick a backup software</h2>



<p>As with most things&mdash;don&rsquo;t over-buy. Features you don&rsquo;t need add complexity and may slow down your system. Additionally, if you intend to back up to a newly purchased external hard drive, check out the software that ships with it. Seagate, WD, and others provide backup utilities that are adequate for the average user.</p>



<p><strong>File backup:</strong> If you want to back up only your data (operating systems and programs can be reinstalled, though it&rsquo;s mildly time- and effort-consuming), a program that backs up just the files you select is a major time-saver. Some programs automatically select the appropriate files if you use the Windows library folders (Documents, Photos, Videos, etc.).</p>



<p><strong>Image backup/imaging:</strong> Images are byte-for-byte snapshots of your entire hard drive (normally without the empty sectors) or partition, and can be used to restore both the operating system and data. Imaging is the most convenient to restore in case of a system crash, and also ensures you don&rsquo;t miss anything important.</p>



<p><strong>Boot media:&nbsp; </strong>Should your system crash completely, you need an alternate way to boot and run the recovery software. Any backup program should be able to create a bootable optical disc or USB thumb drive. Some will also create a restore partition on your hard drive, which can be used instead if the hard drive is still operational.</p>



<p><strong>Scheduling: </strong>If you&rsquo;re going to back up effectively, you need to do it on a regular basis. Any backup program worth its salt allows you to schedule backups.</p>



<p><strong>Versioning:</strong> If you&rsquo;re overwriting previous files, that&rsquo;s not backup, it&rsquo;s one-way syncing or mirroring. Any backup program you use should allow you to retain several previous backups, or with file backup, previous versions of the file. The better software will retain and cull older backups according to criteria you establish.</p>



<p><strong>Optical support: </strong>Every backup program supports hard drives, but as obsolete as they may seem, DVDs and Blu-Ray discs are great archive media. If you&rsquo;re worried about optical media&rsquo;s reliability, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2933478/storage/m-disc-optical-media-reviewed-your-data-good-for-a-thousand-years.html">M-Disc</a>&nbsp;claims its discs are reliable for a thousand years, claims that are backed up by Department of Defense testing.</p>



<p><strong>Online support: </strong>An offsite copy of your data is a hedge against physical disasters such as flood, fire, and power surges. Online storage services are a great way to maintain an offsite copy of your data. Backup to Dropbox and the like is a nice feature to have.</p>



<p><strong>FTP and SMB/AFP:</strong> Backing up to other computers or NAS boxes on your network or in remote locations (say, your parent&rsquo;s house) is another way of physically safeguarding your data with an offsite, or at least physically discrete copy. FTP can be used for offsite, while SMB (Windows and most OS&rsquo;s) and AFP (Apple) are good for other PCs or NAS on your local network.</p>



<p><strong>Real time:</strong> Real-time backup means that files are backed up whenever they change, usually upon creation or save. It&rsquo;s also called mirroring and is handy for keeping an immediately available copy of rapidly changing data sets. For less volatile data sets, the payoff doesn&rsquo;t compensate for the drain on system resources. Instead, scheduling should be used.</p>



<p><strong>Continuous backup:</strong>&nbsp;In this case, &lsquo;continuous&rsquo; simply means backing up on a tight schedule, generally every 5 to 15 minutes, instead of every day or weekly. Use continuous backup for rapidly changing data sets where transfer rates are too slow, or computing power is too precious for real-time backup.</p>



<p><strong>Performance:</strong> Most backups proceed in the background or during dead time, so performance isn&rsquo;t a huge issue in the consumer space. However, if you&rsquo;re backing up multiple machines or to multiple destinations, or dealing with very large data sets, speed is a consideration.</p>

<p>Ideally, you should schedule backups of your data as often as possible. This is especially true if you are working on an important project or have data that you absolutely cannot afford to lose. It is a good idea to automate the backup process and have the Windows software back up your data every hour or so.</p>



<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-google-drive-dropbox-onedrive-and-windows-backup-services">What is the difference between Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, and Windows backup services?</h3>



<p>Services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive are considered to be cloud <em>storage</em> services. This means that a user must place their files or data onto the service&rsquo;s cloud manually. It&rsquo;s almost like having a physical storage drive in the internet&rsquo;s virtual cloud. </p>



<p>Windows backup software, meanwhile, provides continuous versioning and backup of all the file history on your device. It will continuously and automatically backup every specified file on a device. Windows backup software also offers additional data security measures such as file encryption. Furthermore, these backup services allow you to create a bootable optical disc or USB thumb drive for recovery after a system crash.</p>



<p>There are cloud <em>backup</em> services (distinct from those mentioned above) that offer much, though not all, of the benefits of a Windows backup program, such as continuous backups and versioning for multiple devices. You can learn more about them in our roundup of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407149/online-cloud-backup-services-carbonite-idrive-backblaze-livedrive.html">best cloud backup services</a>.</p>



<h3 id="will-windows-backup-software-slow-down-my-computer">Will Windows backup software slow down my computer?</h3>



<p>In most situations Windows backup software won&rsquo;t noticeably slow down your computer. If you are backing up to more than one device or multiple different destinations, or if you are backing up very large data sets, then you may notice your system slow down as it performs the backup. Otherwise, Windows backup software typically runs in the background or during dead time so you shouldn&rsquo;t notice a decrease in performance.</p>



<p>Also, it&rsquo;s a good idea, if the option is available with your software, to run a continuous backup. This will cause the software to perform backups of only the files you change in real time and it requires less bandwidth and processor resources to maintain.</p>
