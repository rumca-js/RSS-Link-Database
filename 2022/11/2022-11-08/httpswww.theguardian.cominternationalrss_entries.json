I was always a fan \u2013 I never really knew them personally until Nels Cline joined our band, and he was friends with Alan [Sparhawk], so Alan started coming around to see us play. We just got to be friends and at some point we toured together, and they asked me to produce a record with them, and I guess that\u2019s when we became pretty close, or closer than just being fellow travellers.<br /><br />I think most people would look at Mimi and not estimate that she was a serious artist. I don\u2019t think she put on any kind of pretension \u2013 there was nothing about her that read as anything other than normal midwesterner. That is my favourite thing on earth, when normal people reveal their depths of emotional understanding, and her poignancy was enhanced by the fact that she was so casual about her genius.<br /><br />I\u2019ve never seen anybody be that casually brilliant. She was a giant \u2013 when I close my mind\u2019s eye and imagine her voice, it rings the clearest to me of any voice I\u2019ve heard in my life. Her voice was so indelibly defined. There\u2019s something truly sacred about the way she sang and savoured notes, almost as a form of meditation \u2013 the way that she and Alan could breathe together and make this music that was secular church music, or something. Being around it and witnessing it is just astonishing, because it was so effortless and it was with zero pretence. For Mimi, it was just a way to live.<br /><br />Low, Alan, Mimi, have just been for me, for a long time, a bar to aim for \u2013 to make music that makes me feel the way their music makes me feel. Even before I met them their music was doing that for me, and certainly after working with them there was an added amount of inspiration in being accepted by them.<br /><br />The thing I keep thinking about Mimi is that she savoured every note, and I\u2019m glad \u2013 there wasn\u2019t a single note that was ever rushed, and that gives me some comfort, knowing that she had the presence of mind to sing with such grounded appreciation of each note she got to sing.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/08/she-was-so-casual-about-her-genius-musicians-on-lows-mimi-parker\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/08/powerball-drawing-winning-numbers-largest-jackpot", "title": "Biggest lottery jackpot in world history tops $2bn", "date_published": "2022-11-08 16:53:10+00:00", "description": "<p>Powerball prize numbers revealed after system hiccup \u2013 millions of Americans now searching through junk drawers</p><p>After issues with processing sales caused an overnight delay, officials overseeing a record $2.04bn Powerball jackpot on Tuesday announced the would-be winning numbers for the largest-ever lottery prize in history: 10-33-41-47-56, and the Powerball was 10.</p><p>The announcement has now left much of the US waiting to learn whether anyone had bought a winning ticket or if the jackpot would swell to an even greater amount.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/08/powerball-drawing-winning-numbers-largest-jackpot\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/08/fias-mohammed-ben-sulayem-condemns-death-threats-against-race-steward", "title": "FIA president condemns death threats against race steward Silvia Bellot", "date_published": "2022-11-08 16:50:04+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>Mohammed ben Sulayem warns abuse \u2018will destroy our sport\u2019</li><li>Bellot was targeted with online threats after US Grand Prix</li></ul><p>The president of the FIA Mohammed ben Sulayem has condemned death threats made against a Formula One race steward and warned that the toxic abuse directed at FIA staff and volunteers threatens to \u201cdestroy\u201d the sport.</p><p>As F1 reels under an onslaught of often poisonous online abuse between fans of different drivers, Ben Sulayem revealed that the FIA steward Silvia Bellot had recently received death threats.

Soups are transformed by the addition of crunchy, creamy, fresh and/or herby things, he says, but you can go as simple (yoghurt, soft-boiled eggs, toasted nuts) or fancy (fish tartare) as you like. Smooth vegetable soups always welcome some extra veg at the end, Mendes says \u2013 he suggests finely dicing some more of the veg you used as the base for the soup, then mix it with fresh herbs and lemon zest and spoon on top. \u201cOr blitz raw cauliflower or broccoli into \u2018couscous\u2019, season and add herbs,\u201d he adds. Veg scraps, too, can give many a soup a lift, says Lucy Carr-Ellison, co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.wildbytart.com/\">Wild by Tart</a>: \u201cUse carrot tops to make a pesto, or shred raw beetroot tops and mix with olive oil and lemon juice.\u201d</p><p>Root veg soups pair happily with fruit in various guises. Mendes floats orange segments on top of his borscht-style beetroot soup, then tops it with a little olive oil and chervil, for instance, while Ramael Scully, executive chef and co-owner of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/may/12/jay-rayer-restaurant-review-ramael-scully-mayfair\">Scully</a> in London, suggests a scattering of pomegranate seeds pickled in red-wine vinegar, pomegranate juice, sugar and a touch of water to go on top of pumpkin soup.
