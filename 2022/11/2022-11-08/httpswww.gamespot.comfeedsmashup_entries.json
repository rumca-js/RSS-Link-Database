The film will star Ana de Armas (Blonde, Blade Runner 2049) as the titular character, a female assassin with similar origins to those of John Wick, and who is also out for revenge.

The pink puffball's latest game, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land/\">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, has already emerged as the top-selling Kirby game ever, with 5.27 million copies sold worldwide.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That means that Forgotten Land dethrones the previous best-seller, Kirby's Dream Land, which sold 5.13 million copies. True heads will recognize this as the Game Boy entry that first introduced Kirby as a grey blob who didn't even have his signature copy ability yet. Yes, Kirby's come a long way in the intervening years.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While it's difficult to pin this down to any one trend, developer HAL Laboratory and Nintendo have a way of pushing Kirby games out in the waning days of a system's lifespan. For example, the NES classic Kirby's Adventure came out in 1993, well into the SNES era, and highly-regarded SNES entry Kirby Super Star was released in 1996, the same year the N64 came out. Thankfully, Kirby's inclusion as a character in the original Super Smash Bros. undoubtedly boosted his popularity over the years, similar to EarthBound's Ness.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-is-already-the-best-selling-kirby-game-ever/1100-6508998/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-top-10-best-selling-switch-games/1100-6508997/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Nintendo Reveals Top 10 Best-Selling Switch Games", "date_published": "2022-11-08 16:00:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">New data from <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html\">Nintendo</a> has revealed the top-selling games for Switch as of September 30.

It's not going to be an easy task, but we trust that you're up for it. However, before you set off into this newest entry with the duo and their ever-growing cast of companions, make sure you've prepared yourself with our list of tips for the journey ahead. After dozens of hours, here are our God of War Ragnarok tips for players just starting out on their return adventure across the nine realms.</p><p>We've deliberately left out any story spoilers from this article, but if you want to know <em>nothing </em>about the game, then you can <strong>consider this beginner's guide to contain very light spoilers</strong> pertaining to the structure of the game and its massive hub world.</p><h2>Explore thoroughly</h2><p>As you explore each realm, you'll quickly notice that there is an abundance of secrets to find throughout each one--hidden chests, lore scrolls, buried treasure, and a myriad of events tied to side quests that unlock as you move forward in the main story. Many of these are off the beaten path and require you to be extremely thorough as you navigate a biome. If something looks interactive, there's a very good chance that it is, and the rewards you'll gain for being so meticulous can make a huge difference in combat and beyond. If you want to level up your gear and take on the hardest challenges in the game, you can't afford to miss any opportunity possible to earn some extra loot.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-tips-for-beginners/1100-6508538/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-where-to-get-frozen-flame-and-chaos-flame/1100-6508934/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "God Of War Ragnarok: Where To Get Frozen Flame And Chaos Flame", "date_published": "2022-11-08 14:00:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">In <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok/\">God of War Ragnarok</a>, crafting Kratos' more expansive arsenal takes a dizzying number of different materials as the game goes on, but Frozen Flame and Chaos Flame are thankfully much more consistent, even if it's a bit tricky as to how you can find more of them. Frozen Flame upgrades Kratos' Leviathan Axe, while Chaos Flame upgrades his signature Blades of Chaos, and though these upgrade opportunities are crucial, it's not immediately obvious how or where to get more of them. Here's an explainer to help you keep Kratos hacking and slashing at peak performance.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Where to get Frozen Flame and Chaos Flame in God of War Ragnarok</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Of the many different crafting resources you'll come across in God of War Ragnarok, Chaos Flame and Frozen Flame are both among the rarest--but they're surprisingly simple to find once you get the hang of it. Both of these items markedly improve your primary weapons, and as a result, <strong>both crafting resources are dropped only after specific mission progress</strong>. Therefore, they <strong>can't be farmed</strong> to overlevel Kratos' arsenal. You'll need to play through the story and side quests to earn Frozen Flame and Chaos Flame drops at the pace Sony Santa Monica intended.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There is one added wrinkle to this, however. Naturally, you'd not want to miss any drops given how rare these items will be in the <strong>20+ hour story</strong>, so be sure to routinely check in with Brok and Sindri at crafting stations and open the large chest that always sits nearby. Inside will be any drops you may have left lingering in any of the nine realms. This makes it so even if you forget to pick something up, you'll never lose it permanently. If you think you've just gotten past a difficult boss battle and should've earned a Frozen Flame or Chaos Flame, check the chest near any of Brok and Sindri's smithing stations. It's possible you <em>did</em> earn more, and you just happened to miss them.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-where-to-get-frozen-flame-and-chaos-flame/1100-6508934/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-leak-was-terribly-unfortunate-take-two-boss-says/1100-6508985/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "GTA 6 Leak Was \"Terribly Unfortunate,\" Take-Two Boss Says", "date_published": "2022-11-08 13:48:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Rockstar's <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/\">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> suffered a major leak in September, and the head of parent company Take-Two has now reacted to the development.
