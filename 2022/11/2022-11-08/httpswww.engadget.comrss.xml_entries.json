The base model Q8 50 e-tron delivers 250 kW (335 HP) with 490 lb-ft of torque alongside a 0-60 of 6 seconds flat, a max range 306 miles for the SUV body style and 313 miles for the Sportback.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Audi Q8 e-tron\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/211ea1e0-5b8f-11ed-bdf6-5d581eadb7a6\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Audi</div></figure><p>The step up Q8 55 e-tron, again both the SUV and Sportback, outputs 300kW peak (402 HP) with 490 lb-ft of torque. The SUV ranges out to 361 miles while the Sportback can hit 600 km (372 miles), thanks to their larger battery pack. The top-of-the-line SQ8 e-tron boasts three motors to the others\u2019 pairs so it can generate 370 kW (496 HP) and 717 ft-lb of torque with 307 miles (SUV) and 319 miles (Sportback) of range. The S model is software limited to a top speed of 130 MPH and a 0-60 of 5.6 seconds.</p><p>The Q8 50s will come equipped with a net-89 kWh battery pack that can charge at up to 150 kW. The Q8 55s, however, are outfitted with a bigger net-106 kWh pack that can achieve 170kW charging rates (higher rates equals faster charging times which means less sitting around a roadside power station). The 55s will be able to refill from 10 to 80 percent (~260 miles of range) in just over a half hour using an L3 DC fast charger, though the rate drops to just 11 - 22kW, depending on the wall box options, for home charging. You\u2019re going to have to leave a Q8 50 on an 11kW socket for about nine and a quarter hours to fully replenish it, and a whopping 11 and a half hours for the bigger Q8 55. Those numbers drop to just under five hours for the 50 and six hours for the 55 at 22 kW.</p><figure><img alt=\"Audi Q8 e-tron\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/211fb350-5b8f-11ed-be9f-33b33c9cc706\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Audi</div></figure><p>The new e-tron line boasts more efficient motors than its predecessors, offering 14-coil power plants that can generate a stronger magnetic field for roughly the same amount of electrical input as the older 12-coil motors required. A stronger field can generate more torque when necessary but also step that power back when it isn\u2019t needed to help extend the vehicle\u2019s range. What\u2019s more, the vehicle\u2019s exteriors have been designed to minimize air resistance, with the Q8 Sportback offering a drag coefficient of just 0.24 \u2014 that\u2019s the same as the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-ev-drive-video-133035906.html\">Polestar 2</a> \u2014 and the Q8 e-tron offering 0.27, slightly better than the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html\">VW ID.4</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\"Audi Q8 e-tron quattro and the tech behind it\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/375f16e0-5baa-11ed-bffd-5d74f9a75627\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Audi</div></figure><p>\u201cLooking at the current Audi e-tron, it's clear that we're starting with a very solid base of technical features as we move forward into the Q8 e-tron family,\u201d Audi spokesperson Benedikt Still said during a press preview last week. \u201cWe'll be carrying over retaining this strong character in the new model, groundbreaking features such as the digital matrix headlights or the virtual side mirrors are still at the technical forefront today.\u201d</p><p>As is the way in the luxury vehicle segment, the Q8 is packed with high-tech features.

The camera is an iterative upgrade over the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gopro-hero-10-review-a-big-invisible-upgrade-130041612.html\">excellent Hero 10 Black</a> \u2014 which itself looked near-identical to the prior <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gopro-hero-9-black-review-140026287.html\">Hero 9 Black</a> \u2014 which means it still allows for crisp video at up to 5.3K/60 Hz, 4K/120 Hz, or 2.7K/240 Hz (for extra slow-motion shots), excellent stabilization that keeps moving footage looking smooth, and a rugged, waterproof design that's small enough to fit on a helmet, bike handle, surfboard, or most other tight spots.</p><p>Here, though, there's a taller 1/1.9\" sensor with an 8:7 aspect ratio, which is more accommodating to shooting vertical video for mobile video apps like TikTok at the same time as more traditional vertical footage. A new shooting mode called \"<a href=\"https://community.gopro.com/s/article/What-Is-HyperView?language=en_US\">HyperView</a>\" uses the taller sensor to take wider-angle video \u2014 though our review notes that this is best used with only certain types of action shots \u2014 while a 360-degree horizon lock feature keeps shots level even if you fully rotate the camera. Still images have been bumped from 23-megapixels to 27, and you can now shoot higher-quality RAW images in burst mode instead of just JPEG. Beyond that, battery life is mildly improved, there are new night shooting modes for capturing things like star trails, and there's support for more granular 10-bit color across the board.</p><p>Action cameras still aren't essential gadgets for most these days, and if you already own a Hero 10, Hero 9, or another cam you're already happy with, there's no pressing need to hop aboard here.

He's ridden giants up Mount Olympus, murdered the pantheon of Greek gods, come back to life from the underworld (several times) and, in 2018's reinvention of the series, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-12-god-of-war-review.html\"><ins>dealt with an unruly pre-teen</ins></a> who just learned he was a god. But <em>God of War: Ragnarok</em>, which arrives tomorrow for the PS4 and PS5, manages to add to that impressive list. It throws Kratos and his companions in the middle of a full-on war, the kind of battle that calls to mind epic cinematic showdowns like the climax of <em>Lord of the Rings:</em><em>Return of the King</em> or <em>Avengers: Endgame.</em></p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>But I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself. <em>God of War: Ragnarok</em> is the direct sequel to <em>God of War</em>, which saw a semi-reformed Kratos and his son Atreus try to carry out his wife's final wish. Along the way, they inevitably caught the attention of the Norse pantheon of gods, which led to Kratos killing the deity Baldur. Kratos meant to save Baldur's mother Freya from death, but he instead turned Freya into against Kratos and Atreus and also brought about Fimbulwinter, a years-long winter that is the precursor to Ragnarok, which it is said will bring about the end of the nine realms.</p><p>Got all that? Clearly, you won't want to play <em>Ragnarok</em> without playing the 2018 <em>God of War</em> first, because you'll be missing a lot of backstory. Assuming you are caught up, you'll feel right at home in <em>Ragnarok</em>. The game quickly and clearly lays out the enemies and the stakes: Odin, leader of the Norse gods, knows Ragnarok is coming, and wants to work with Atreus and Kratos to try to survive it. Kratos, on the other hand, has a more than healthy distrust of Odin, and isn't interested in anything besides staying out of the gods' affairs and helping his son stay safe and prepared for the harsh world they inhabit.</p><figure><img alt=\"God of War: Ragnarok review screenshots\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/2202fa30-5f7b-11ed-b3f6-67804c2e65de\" style=\"height: 2160; width: 3840;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sony / Santa Monica Studios</div></figure><p>Whether by prophecy or their own decisions, Kratos and Atreus unsurprisingly get pulled deeper into the machinations of the gods and begin journeying through the nine realms looking for a solution to the potential world destruction that is now at their doorstep. From a gameplay perspective, that means a lot of the familiar combat that Santa Monica Studio introduced in 2018's <em>God of War</em>. Kratos is again equipped with his Leviathan Axe and Blades of Chaos, and they remain a formidable and extremely fun pair of weapons to use on the many mythical beasts <em>Ragnarok</em> throws at you. Throwing the Leviathan Axe with the PS5's DualSense controller and magically calling it back to you remains one of the most satisfying moves I can think of in all of gaming.</p><p>As before, the game starts you out with a powerful but relatively basic set of moves and you can add to that arsenal by upgrading your weapons, finding powerful runic attacks for each weapon, crafting new armor and magical items and unlocking new skills in the game's fairly complicated upgrade trees. As in the 2018 title, there are a dizzying array of moves you can unlock, as well as a treasure trove of armor, all of which affects Kratos' stats. It can be overwhelming, but I also found that I didn't need to think too hard about it, at least on the difficulty level I was playing on. If you play on the harder settings, though, you're going to need to spend a lot of time doing side quests to get the resources you need so you can constantly optimize your gear.</p><p>Regardless of the over-abundance of customization, going into battle as Kratos remains extremely satisfying. Whether you're fighting a massive swarm of enemies or focusing your efforts on a massive, ultra-powerful beast, there's a level of fluidity to the combat that makes the player feel, quite simply, god-like. It takes a while to upgrade Kratos and figure out what style of play works best for you, but sometimes you can get into a flow state of total destruction that is a delight.</p><p>One of the complaints I had about 2018's <em>God of War</em> was that, while the combat was great, the variety of enemies was lacking compared to earlier games. Santa Monica Studio seems to have taken this to heart and mixed things up significantly in <em>Ragnarok</em>.There are a greater variety of basic enemies, though undead soldiers remain the game's bread and butter. But those armies have some tricky new powers this time, including the ability to hit Kratos with a multi-colored \u201cbifrost\u201d blast \u2014 while you're in that state, a single hit explodes that bifrost and significantly reduces your health. There are also new small and agile enemies that I think of as puppet masters; they keep reviving and healing the ordinary soldiers, so unless you track them down and dispose of them quickly, you're in for a rough fight.</p><figure><img alt=\"God of War: Ragnarok review screenshots\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/1c13ec70-5f7a-11ed-a3b7-973ebad8ec74\" style=\"height: 2160; width: 3840;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sony / Santa Monica Studios</div></figure><p>More significant are the variety of bosses in <em>Ragnarok</em>. In <em>God of War</em>, the larger battles mostly consisted of a few different types of trolls and ogres along with some elemental, but that is most definitely not the case this time. I took down a massive realm-shifting serpent, a building-sized wolf rampaging through Hel, and that's not even mentioning the inevitable battles against the Norse gods.</p><p>Once again, the nine realms Kratos and Atreus travel through are simply stunning. <em>Ragnarok</em>, like some other recent PS5 games, has both \u201cfavor performance\u201d and \u201cfavor visuals\u201d modes. The default performance mode runs at a locked 60 frames per second and scales the resolution between 1440p and 4K. Favor visuals instead locks the frame rate at 30 fps and delivers native 4K graphics. There are also a variety of options if you have a HFR TV; <em>Polygon</em> did a great job of breaking down the technical details <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/23435650/god-of-war-ragnarok-graphics-modes-ps5-ps4-performance-resolution-comparison\"><ins>here</ins></a>.</p><figure><img alt=\"God of War: Ragnarok review screenshots\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/5dcff7c0-5f7b-11ed-b67b-1d5abf3ce10b\" style=\"height: 2160; width: 3840;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sony / Santa Monica Studios</div></figure><p>Whether in performance or fidelity mode, <em>God of War: Ragnarok</em> looks beautiful. The snowy vistas and frozen lake of Midgard put a chill in my bones, and the lush and swampy confines of Vanaheim were real enough to make me want to sweat from the humidity. All of the character models, from Krato and Atreus down to minor characters you only meet a few times, are equally well-rendered \u2014 Kratos in particular is more detailed than ever, with his scars, beard, world-weary eyes and callused hands showing the hundreds of years and innumerable trials he's been through.</p><p>I would be remiss not to mention the incredible skill and performances from <em>Ragnarok</em>'s cast. Returning actors Christopher Judge (Kratos), Sunny Suljic (Atreus) and Alastair Duncan (Mimir) reprise their excellent performances and have a wonderful rapport throughout their extensive time together in this game. Danielle Bisutti, meanwhile, takes her performance as a grief-obsessed, revenge-driven Freya to new levels of desperation in this installment.</p><section><img alt=\"God of War: Ragnarok review screenshots\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/6e0e0ed0-5f79-11ed-a4be-aa4b4e1f0ab0\" /></section><p>A couple of newcomers almost steal the show, however. Ryan Hurst as the overweight, overburdened, often drunk Thor is both comical and terrifying. But Richard Schiff (perhaps best known as Toby from <em>The West Wing</em>) steals the show as the conniving all-father Odin. Schiff perfectly executes the many facets of Odin's character in <em>Ragnarok</em> \u2014 he seems to want peace and knowledge, and is almost fatherly at times. But even when he's being kind, Schiff's unsettling performance never lets you forget Odin's long list of cruelties, and the fact that he simply cannot be trusted.</p><p><strong><em>Note: the following section contains light spoilers for God of War: Ragnarok</em></strong></p><section><img alt=\"God of War: Ragnarok review screenshots\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/9fd102b0-5f79-11ed-96fe-add2bd92e7c6\" /></section><p>Despite all this, <em>Ragnarok</em> felt a little too familiar in the first three or four hours, a bit more like an expansion than an entirely new game on a more powerful platform. That all changed at the end of the game's first extended mission, however. <em>God of War: Ragnarok</em> has the same impressive direction as the previous game, where everything is done in a single, hours-long camera shot, without any cuts (aside from when you die, of course). This time, however, the camera panned away from Kratos and slowly, as the cutscene proceeded, settled in behind Atreus. And when the game was back in my control, I was playing as Kratos' son for the first time.</p><p>It was a brilliant reveal, and playing as Atreus makes the story far more complex and less linear than it was in the prior game. Atreus naturally has an entirely different combat style, based on more on his bow than hand-to-hand combat. But more than the gameplay, this choice greatly expanded the narrative of the game. It marks the first time the series shifts away from Kratos and gives you a more up-close view of the struggles that persist between father and son as they both try and do the right thing for each other throughout the game.</p><p>This also opens up the opportunity for new pairings, as Atreus and Kratos are both accompanied by characters familiar and unknown. These new pairings expand the story far beyond just Kratos and Atreus, showing a variety of different conflicts between parents and children all dealing with generational trauma and trying to simply be better than they were before, with varying results.</p><p><strong><em>End of spoilers</em></strong></p><section><img alt=\"God of War: Ragnarok review screenshots\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/a0dd7ec0-5f7b-11ed-bbca-4e6e1019d68b\" /></section><p>Thanks to the many new characters, the world feels more alive and populated than any other previous God of War game. The dwarven realm of Svartalfheim has a number of settlements along its vast lake, and you meet a number of new allies in Vanaheim, the home realm of Freya and the other Vanir gods. We also get to meet both the human and godly residents of Asgard, Odin\u2019s homeland. It makes sense that in the brutal conditions of Fimbulwinter you don\u2019t run across a lot of ordinary humans, but I do wish that the main area of Midgard did contain at least a few more glimpses of how humans live in this universe.</p><p>While I\u2019m a big fan of <em>Ragnarok</em>\u2019s story, the game does occasionally feel overlong. <em>God of War</em> was one of my favorite games of the PS4 generation, alongside <em>The Last of Us</em> and <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>. The sequels to those latter two games were both <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-review-water-robot-dinos-080126554.html\">masterfully</a><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review-070140792.html\">executed</a> \u2014 but also occasionally hampered by the need to make everything bigger and grander than the prior games. The same is true for <em>Ragnarok</em>: it took me about 28 hours to play through the main quest, with very little side questing done. More than just the sheer hours, though, was a simple feeling that the narrative got a little too weighed down at times when I was eager for some momentum to bring through to the game's climax.</p><p>But what an ending it was: The last three hours or so of <em>Ragnarok</em> pull together everything God of War does well, from difficult, high stakes combat, majestic and massive set pieces and surprising narrative twists to a satisfying and emotional denouement. I won't say any more, but a little bit of narrative flabbiness was completely forgiven by the breathtaking finale.</p><p>It's slightly too much of a good thing, but not enough to keep me thrilled about the idea of playing again at a more leisurely pace, where I can do more exploring. And when you finish up the main story, there's still plenty you can do around the nine realms, including a few side quests that only unlock when the game is complete (I definitely caught a tease of another incredibly difficult battle to come).</p><p>While <em>God of War: Ragnarok</em> may have benefitted from a little bit more editing, it's not nearly enough to deter me from recommending it. Anyone who enjoyed <em>God of War</em> should play <em>Ragnarok</em> as soon as possible \u2014 and if you never played the first game, give it a shot and then move right along to this brilliant sequel. I don't know if or when we'll see Kratos and Atreus again, but <em>Ragnarok</em> was a fitting conclusion to the Norse saga and one of the best games I've experienced in a long time.</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html?src=rss", "title": "The best Chromebooks you can buy in 2022", "date_published": "2022-11-08 15:45:13+00:00", "description": "<p>Choosing the best Chromebook for your needs and your budget can be hard to do given the multitude of models on the market today.

There are plenty of inexpensive Windows laptops on the market, so why bother with Chrome OS? Glad you asked. For me, the simple and clean nature of Chrome OS is a big selling point. If you didn\u2019t know, it\u2019s based on Google\u2019s Chrome browser, which means most of the programs you can run are web based. There\u2019s no bloatware or unwanted apps to uninstall like you often get on Windows laptops, it boots up in seconds, and you can completely reset to factory settings almost as quickly.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Of course, the simplicity is also a major drawback for some users. Not being able to install native software can be a dealbreaker if you\u2019re, say, a video editor or software developer. But there are also plenty of people who do the vast majority of their work in a browser. Unless I need to edit photos for a review, I can do my entire job on a Chromebook.</p><p>Google has also added support for Android apps on Chromebooks, which greatly expands the amount of software available. The quality varies widely, but it means you can do more with a Chromebook beyond just web-based apps. For example, you can install the Netflix app and save videos for offline watching; other Android apps like Microsoft\u2019s Office suite and Adobe Lightroom are surprisingly capable. Between Android apps and a general improvement in web apps, Chromebooks are more than just a browser.</p><h2>What do Chromebooks do well?</h2><figure><img alt=\"Three Chromebook laptops stacked on top of each other, fanning out a bit, on top of a desk protector on a wooden table.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-08/38bdd2f0-2488-11ed-affd-31657bb03b0c\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>Put simply, anything web based. Browsing, streaming music and video and using various social media sites are among the most common things people do on Chromebooks. As you might expect, they also work well with Google services like Photos, Docs, Gmail, Drive, Keep and so on. Yes, any computer that can run Chrome can do that too, but the lightweight nature of Google Chrome OS makes it a responsive and stable platform.</p><p>As I mentioned before, Chrome OS can run Android apps, so if you\u2019re an Android user you\u2019ll find some nice ties between the platforms. You can get most of the same apps that are on your phone on a Chromebook and keep info in sync between them. You can also use some Android phones as a security key for your Chromebook or instantly tether your laptop to use mobile data.</p><p>Google continues to tout security as a major differentiator for Chromebooks, and I think it\u2019s definitely a factor worth considering. The first line of defense is auto-updates. Chrome OS updates download quickly in the background and a fast reboot is all it takes to install the latest version. Google says that each webpage and app on a Chromebook runs in its own sandbox, as well, so any security threats are contained to that individual app. Finally, Chrome OS has a self-check called Verified Boot that runs every time a device starts up. Beyond all this, the simple fact that you generally can\u2019t install traditional apps on a Chromebook means there are a lot fewer ways for bad actors to access the system.</p><p>As for when to avoid them, the answer is simple: If you rely heavily on a specific native application for Windows or a Mac, chances are you won\u2019t find the exact same option on a Chromebook. That\u2019s most true in fields like photo and video editing, but it can also be the case in law or finance. Plenty of businesses run on Google\u2019s G suite software, but more still have specific requirements that a Chromebook might not match. If you\u2019re an iPhone user, you\u2019ll also miss out on the way the iPhone easily integrates with an iPad or Mac. For me, the big downside is not being able to access iMessage on a Chromebook.</p><p>Finally, gaming is mostly a non-starter, as there are no native Chrome OS games of note. You can install Android games from the Google Play Store, but that\u2019s not what most people are thinking of when they want to game on a laptop. That said, Google\u2019s game-streaming service Stadia has changed that long-standing problem. The service isn\u2019t perfect, but it remains the only way to play recent, high-profile games on a Chromebook. It\u2019s not as good as running local games on a Windows computer, but the lag issues that can crop up reflect mostly on Stadia itself and not Chrome OS.</p><p>There\u2019s also a potential change on the horizon in that regard, as Valve and Google are working to bring the massive Steam catalog to Chromebooks. Right now, Steam is only available as an early alpha on a handful of devices with higher specs, but it works a lot better than I expected. Of course, you\u2019re still not going to run the most demanding games on basic laptops, but the Steam catalog is so vast that there are plenty of titles that worked on the Chromebook I tested it with. Maybe by next year, Steam will be supported on more devices.</p><h2>What are the most important specs for a Chromebook?</h2><figure><img alt=\"Acer Chromebook Spin 713\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/28c4bed0-cd37-11eb-a7ff-de290c52cdf7\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>Chrome OS is lightweight and usually runs well on fairly modest hardware, so the most important thing to look for might not be processor power or storage space. That said, I\u2019d still recommend you get a Chromebook with a relatively recent Intel processor, ideally an eighth-generation or newer M3 or i3. Most non-Intel Chromebooks I\u2019ve tried haven\u2019t had terribly good performance, but that\u2019s starting to change. Lenovo\u2019s Chromebook Duet 2-in-1 from 2021 runs surprisingly well on its MediaTek processor.</p><p>As for RAM, 8GB should be the target, unless you\u2019re looking for a budget model and know that your needs are fairly modest. Storage space is another place where you don\u2019t need to spend <em>too</em> much; 64GB should be fine for almost anyone. If you plan on storing a lot of files locally or loading up your Chromebook with Linux or Android apps, get 128GB. But for what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019ve never felt like I might run out of storage when using Chrome OS.</p><p>Things like the keyboard and display quality are arguably more important than sheer specs. The good news is that you can find less expensive Chromebooks that still have pretty good screens and keyboards that you won\u2019t mind typing on all day. Many cheap Chromebooks still come with tiny, low-resolution displays, but at this point there\u2019s no reason to settle for anything less than 1080p. (If you\u2019re looking for an extremely portable, 11-inch Chromebook, though, you\u2019ll probably end up with a lesser screen.) Obviously, keyboard quality is a bit more subjective, but there are plenty of affordable options that offer strong typing experiences.</p><p>Google has an Auto Update policy for Chromebooks, and while that\u2019s not a spec, per se, it\u2019s worth checking before you buy. Basically, Chromebooks get regular software updates automatically for about six years from their release date (though that can vary from device to device). <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6220366?hl=en\">This support page</a> lists the Auto Update expiration date for virtually every Chromebook ever, but a good rule of thumb is to buy the newest machine you can to maximize your support.</p><h2>How much should I spend?</h2><p>Chromebooks started out notoriously cheap, with list prices often coming in under $300. But as they\u2019ve gone more mainstream, they\u2019ve transitioned from being essentially modern netbooks to the kind of laptop you\u2019ll want to use all day. As such, prices have increased a bit over the last few years. At this point, you should expect to spend at least $400 if you want a solid daily driver. There are still many budget options out there that may be suitable as couch machines or secondary devices, but Chromebooks that can be an all-day, every-day laptop will cost a bit more.</p><p>There are also plenty of premium Chromebooks that approach or even exceed $1,000, but I don\u2019t recommend spending that much. Generally, that\u2019ll get you a better design with more premium materials, as well as more powerful internals and extra storage space. Of course, you also sometimes pay for the brand name. But, the specs I outlined earlier are usually enough.</p><p>Right now, there actually aren\u2019t too many Chromebooks that cost that much. Google\u2019s Pixelbook Go comes in $999 and $1,399 configurations, but the more affordable $650 and $850 options will be just as good for nearly everyone. Samsung released the $1,000 Galaxy Chromebook in 2020; this luxury device does almost everything right but has terrible battery life. Samsung quickly learned from that mistake and is now offering the Galaxy Chromebook 2 with more modest specs, but vastly better battery life at a more affordable price . For the most part, you don\u2019t need to spend more than $850 to get a premium Chromebook that\u2019ll last you years.</p><h2>Best overall: Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i</h2><p></p><p>Lenovo has been making some of the best Chromebooks you can buy for several years now, and in 2022 it has once again made the best option for most people. The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOVJOQ04zWVYvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTNyLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3MWNhMzU1ZS1iZTA2LTNiYTItYTg0YS0zZTU1YTE5ZGJjODQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASwtk4nvvnAapsUpYTRegIEjzGUs1MgLdkwoMOl1VVf3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09RNCN3YV%2F\">IdeaPad Flex 5i Chromebook</a> is essentially an upgraded version of the model we recommended last year, and there are a few notable improvements. The 13.3-inch, 1080p touchscreen is extremely bright and fairly sharp; I wish it had a taller aspect ratio than 16:9, but this type of screen is very commonplace in Chromebooks. It runs on a 11th-generation Intel Core i3 processor and includes 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage; both of those are double what last year\u2019s model offered. The eight-hour battery life is pretty good for a laptop in this price range, and the backlit keyboard is excellent for such an affordable device. The key caps feel a little small under my fingers, but that\u2019s the only real complaint I have.</p><p>The Flex 5i is no longer available directly from Lenovo, but you can commonly find it on Amazon for about $400 (as of this writing, it is selling for $409; when I bought it, it was priced at $390). That\u2019s an outstanding value.</p><p>Other things in the Flex 5i\u2019s favor include that it has both USB-C and USB-A ports, a microSD card slot and a security lock. At three pounds and 0.66 inches thick, it\u2019s not the lightest or slimmest option out there, but it\u2019s totally reasonable considering the price. Finally, the Flex 5i will receive software and security updates until June of 2029, so you can buy this computer and have it covered for years to come.</p><p>Ultimately, the Ideapad Flex 5i hits the sweet spot for a large majority of Chromebook buyers out there, providing a level of quality and performance that\u2019s pretty rare to find at this price point. That said, given this laptop has been out for over a year now, we\u2019re keeping an eye out for a replacement from Lenovo, as well as comparable options other manufacturers release.</p><p>One to look out for is Lenovo\u2019s Chromebook 5i, which the company recently released. Right now, it\u2019s only available with an Intel Pentium Gold processor and 4GB of RAM; in my testing, that wasn\u2019t enough power in 2022. The device froze up far too often, and the IdeaPad Flex 5i with its i3 processor was clearly faster at everything I tried. But Lenovo says it\u2019ll offer the Chromebook 5i with up to an Intel i5 processor, which should make the laptop worth checking out.</p><h2>Upgrade option: Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2</h2><p></p><p>Last year, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOTdXRDlQNEsvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTNyLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3MWNhMzU1ZS1iZTA2LTNiYTItYTg0YS0zZTU1YTE5ZGJjODQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeH9CLg_vzNG7yu9wPFnOfDD8xFVXhPdLwwq8OkofTAi&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB097WD9P4K%2F\">Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Chromebook 2</a> was one of my recommendations for people looking for a more premium Chromebook. Now that Samsung often sells the device for $550, it\u2019s an excellent all-purpose recommendation if you want something more svelte and stylish than Lenovo\u2019s IdeaPad Flex 5i.</p><p>The Galaxy Chromebook 2 is infinitely more stylish than most other Chromebooks, with a bright metallic red finish and sleek design. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Chromebook 2 fixes some of the serious flaws we identified in the original Galaxy Chromebook. Specifically, the 2020 Galaxy Chromebook had terrible battery life and cost $999; this year\u2019s model can be found for $550 and can last seven hours off the charger. That\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s far better than the lousy four hours the original offered.</p><p>Samsung cut a few corners to lower the Galaxy Chromebook 2\u2019s price. Most noticeable is the 1080p 13.3-inch touchscreen, down from the 4K panel on the older model. The good news is that the display is among the best 1080p laptop screens I\u2019ve seen in a long time, and the lower resolution helps the battery life, too. Along with that excellent screen, the device also has a very comfortable keyboard, though I wish the trackpad was a little bigger. The Galaxy Chromebook 2 is also a bit thicker and heavier than its predecessor, but it\u2019s still reasonably compact. At 13.9mm thick and 2.7 pounds, it\u2019s noticeably smaller than the Lenovo.</p><p>The Galaxy Chromebook 2 has a 10th-generation Intel Core i3 processor paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, which is plenty. This all adds up to a laptop that isn\u2019t as ambitious as the first Galaxy Chromebook, but one that is much easier to recommend. Instead of pushing to have the best screen in the thinnest and lightest body with a faster processor, Samsung pulled everything back a bit to make a better-priced but still premium laptop. Given that the Galaxy Chromebook 2 is well over a year old now, I wouldn\u2019t recommend spending $700 on it \u2013 but if you can catch it on sale for $550 (as it is right now), it\u2019s a solid option.</p><h2>Premium option: Acer Chromebook Spin 714</h2><p></p><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BY2VyLUNocm9tZWJvb2stQ0I3MTQtMVd0LTUzNFQtVG91Y2hzY3JlZW4tUGxhbmUvZHAvQjA3WDI1UzY1Qz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0zci0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzFjYTM1NWUtYmUwNi0zYmEyLWE4NGEtM2U1NWExOWRiYzg0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAWnrOEXL6YZKVFM8arszfY44nRvHl52u0ifRmIV1uufc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAcer-Chromebook-CB714-1Wt-534T-Touchscreen-Plane%2Fdp%2FB07X25S65C\">Acer\u2019s Chromebook Spin 714</a> is an evolution of the Spin 713 that I recommended last year. Acer made a few tweaks to the formula, but you\u2019re still getting a well-built, powerful laptop that won\u2019t turn any heads with its design but gets the job done well.</p><p>I loved the display on the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and unfortunately the one on the Spin 714 isn\u2019t quite as exciting. It\u2019s a 14-inch, 1900x1200 touchscreen; that works out to a taller 16:10 aspect ratio than you\u2019ll get from the 1080p panels on most other Chromebooks. I\u2019m a big fan of taller laptop screens \u2013 but the Spin 713 had a 13.5-inch screen that had an even taller 3:2 aspect ratio and a higher resolution. I can\u2019t help but wonder if Acer found that people still prefer a widescreen display. If that\u2019s the case, the Spin 714\u2019s display is a nice middle ground.</p><p>Putting aside these comparisons to last year\u2019s model, the Spin 714\u2019s screen is still very nice \u2013 it can get uncomfortably bright if that\u2019s your thing, and the bezels are thin. It\u2019s not nearly as pixel-dense as the Spin 713, but it\u2019s still plenty sharp. Between the extra vertical height and the slightly larger screen, the Spin 714\u2019s display is a pleasure to use.</p><p>As for the rest of the hardware, the 12th-generation Intel Core i5 processor is more than enough power for most tasks, and the keyboard and trackpad are solid, if not the best I\u2019ve used before. The same can be said for battery life: I got about seven hours using the Spin 714 in my normal daily routine \u2013 not exceptional, but in line with what I\u2019ve seen on other Chromebooks with an i5 processor. Rounding out the hardware is 8GB of RAM and a generous 256GB of storage space. From a support perspective, Google will offer software and security updates until June of 2030.</p><p>Another bonus is that its hardware meets Google\u2019s recommended specs to run Steam, though the alpha build is still limited to seven devices. So while it\u2019s not officially supported yet, Steam will hopefully work on this laptop once Google and Valve start rolling it out more widely.</p><p>Just as the name suggests, the Spin 714 has a 360-degree hinge which lets you use the laptop in tablet mode. I\u2019m not particularly a fan of this \u2013 I don\u2019t know who wants to use a 3-plus pound tablet, but Acer did include a built-in stylus for handwriting notes or drawing in apps like the built-in Chrome Canvas.</p><p>The Spin 714 configuration I tested costs $730 \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of money for a Chromebook. But it\u2019s not an unreasonable price for a computer with these specs and built quality. For most people, the Lenovo will be enough. But, if you\u2019re a serious multitasker, want a better display and keyboard, or just want a computer that\u2019ll last as long as possible, the Acer Spin 714 is easy to recommend.</p><p></p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-gifts-for-coffee-lovers-130018731.html?src=rss", "title": "The best gifts for coffee lovers in 2022", "date_published": "2022-11-08 14:16:26+00:00", "description": "<p>When it comes to holiday shopping, there\u2019s no success like feeding a hobby someone on your list is already knee-deep in.

Plus, the \u201chold temp\u201d option lets you set and forget the water for a bit; you can turn it on before you start your morning routine and come back to perfectly heated water, ready for whatever\u2019s picking you up that morning. <em>\u2014 Valentina Palladino, Senior Commerce Editor</em></p><a class=\"athena-button rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwN1QxQ0gySEgvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTNxLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YjYzNDc1ZC1lNGYwLTQyMjYtYmMyZC1hMzBkOTVmNTk5MGQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAV0RAFLlePkEcV4Qnzt__9fY_eg7TpcNDF-C4mGehyI5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07T1CH2HH%2F\" id=\"c2acbbdb4eec40a983ee0935b734500f\">Buy Cosori electric kettle at Amazon - $70</a><h2>BruMate NAV mini</h2><figure><img alt=\"BruMate NAV mini\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/0214e1f0-56d1-11ed-bfa3-ff7f5e73a14b\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>When it comes to travel mugs for coffee and tea, any item worth considering needs to check a few boxes \u2013 especially if you\u2019re giving one as a gift.

You'll get a familiar mix of analog hands with smartwatch features like activity tracking and notifications (on an actually-useful display that's rare for hybrids), but in a rugged design that can handle contact with nature. It reportedly meets US military standards for dust, shock, temperature and water resistance, and its 10ATM rating lets it survive dives down to 328 feet. There's even a Tactical Edition that supports dual-format GPS, night vision compatibility and a kill switch.</p><p>The battery life is also strong compared to other rugged smartwatches, and even some hybrids. Garmin claims the standard Instinct Crossover lasts almost a month on a charge with full smartwatch features, and 110 hours with GPS tracking. You can easily use this for a weekend camping trip. Not surprisingly, the Solar Edition lasts much longer. It can run for up to 70 days in smartwatch mode when there's adequate light, and it has effectively \"infinite\" longevity if you're willing to use a battery saver mode that limits you to basics like time and a stopwatch.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>You can still expect the usual mix of health and fitness features, such as a pulse oximeter, VO2 Max (maximum oxygen use) and tools for training and hiking landmarks.

You'll need a phone with a compatible network chipset and a WiFi router to match, but this theoretically delivers speeds of up to 6.5Gbps on-device while improving reliability and reducing lag.</p><p>The Dimensity 9200 is also said to be the first mobile chip to use an <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/arm-armv9-architecture-180043435.html\">ARMv9</a> Gen 2 architecture, and uses new cores to match. A \"big\" Cortex-X3 core handles the most demanding tasks with the help of three Cortex-A715 performance cores. Four Cortex-A510 low-power cores help with battery life. The combo delivers a modest 10 to 12 percent boost over the Dimensity 9000 in synthetic tests, but reportedly cuts power consumption by as much as 25 percent.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The largest speedups come with graphics. The Dimensity 9200 is one of the first chips to use ARM's new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/arm-immortalis-g715-announced-specs-172726361.html\">Immortalis-G715</a> GPU, bringing hardware ray tracing, three times the triangle throughput and greater efficiency. It's up to 32 percent faster than the GPU in the Dimensity 9000 while using 41 percent less power, MediaTek says.</p><p>Other improvements are subtler, but still useful. Unlike many MediaTek chips, the 9200 supports both sub-6GHz and millimeter wave 5G to provide fast cellular data in more parts of the world. The Imagiq 890 image signal processor is the first to support RGBW camera sensors, promising more brightness and detail in photos than plain RGB. It can counteract motion blur, too. You can also expect support for fast UFS 4.0 storage, the latest LPDDR5X memory (8.5Gbps) and 24-bit/192KHz audio.</p><p>The first phones using the Dimensity 9200 should be available by the end of 2022. This won't necessarily make Qualcomm sweat, especially with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 likely on the horizon. However, this could put MediaTek into more high-end phones \u2014 and that's good for both choice and competition.</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/instagram-in-app-scheduler-055239620.html?src=rss", "title": "Instagram rolls out in-app scheduler to businesses and creators", "date_published": "2022-11-08 05:52:39+00:00", "description": "<p>Instagram is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CkrIB74gb1-/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3Dv\">rolling out</a> its in-app post scheduler, allowing select users to plan their posts in advance without having to use <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/facebook-reels-instagram-crossposting-add-yours-tiktok-184410879.html\">Meta's Creator Studio</a> or third-party services.
