Over the course of three movies (going on four), the <em>John Wick </em>franchise has grown exceedingly rich and weird. However, spinoffs like <em>The Continental</em> are still a ways off, and with a reported second spinoff helmed by Ana de Armas in the works, Lionsgate is searching for other ways to keep attention on the franchise. </p>

  <p id="xmAa0Y">Nvidia <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/14/23404595/nvidia-rtx-408-12gb-unlaunch">paused the launch</a> of its 12GB RTX 4080 graphics card last month, after a backlash over the naming and pricing. Now a well-known leaker says the “unlaunched” GPU will return as the RTX 4070 Ti in January, as Nvidia attempts to fix the confusing naming around two RTX 4080 cards that had totally different specs.</p>
<p id="w5vYTW">Twitter user kopite7kimi says “the original RTX 4080 12GB will become RTX 4070 Ti instead,” and replied to questions on a January 2023 release date <a href="https://twitter.com/kopite7kimi/status/1589856844050464771">with a thumbs up</a>. Kopite7kimi previously correctly predicted the specifications of the RTX 3090 and RTX 3080, and that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/16/23076656/nvidia-rtx-4090-rumor-release-july-2022">RTX 4090 would require</a> 450 watts of power.</p>

  <p id="kFUyhi">If Friday<a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/twitter-cut-in-half"> brought massive layoffs to Twitter</a>, Monday brought fresh evidence that the company will never be the same. Musk has discussed putting the entire site behind a paywall, <strong>Platformer</strong> has learned. Meanwhile, the company is scrambling to lure back employees who it laid off mere hours ago, and some workers say the economics behind its soon-to-relaunch Twitter Blue subscription could actually lose the company money.</p>
<p id="uhjJsH">All of this took place against the backdrop of a company that still has yet to hear anything official from Musk, via email or a companywide meeting. As Monday began, after losing thousands of their colleagues days earlier, many employees didn’t know who their managers are.</p>
