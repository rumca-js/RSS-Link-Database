## James Justin injury mars Leicester City’s easy win against Newport

<p>Whether Gareth Southgate intended to call up James Justin to his England World Cup squad on Thursday may forever be a mystery after the Leicester defender was carried off on a stretcher during the second half of a routine Carabao Cup victory over Newport County. Southgate is already fretting over his full-back options with Ben Chilwell ruled out and Reece James and Kyle Walker major doubts. Justin, who is thought to have been on Southgate’s 55-man long-list for Qatar, was forced off after an innocuous collision. He made his comeback from injury in January after missing almost a year of action with an anterior cruciate ligament injury.</p><p>It was a cruel way for Justin’s night to finish given the 24-year-old defender, who is comfortable playing on both flanks, had set Leicester on the path to victory with a stunning left-foot shot that cracked in off a post before Jamie Vardy scored two second-half goals as Brendan Rodgers’s side eased into the last 16 of the competition. Perhaps Justin took inspiration from Kevin De Bruyne, whose recent match-winning free-kick for Manchester City also pinged in off the upright.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/08/leicester-city-newport-county-carabao-cup-third-round-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The treatment of the British-Egyptian democracy activist is a travesty, and emblematic of the regime’s brutality</p><p>Only the Egyptian regime knows the fate of Alaa Abd el-Fattah.

<p>Shaped around the loss of its original hero Chadwick Boseman, this take pays tribute to the late actor with fiery performances and great spectacle</p><p>The fictional African state of Wakanda becomes a matriarchy in a fervent, yet understandably subdued new Black Panther movie whose exuberant and mournful impulses are at odds with each other. We can also see, almost in real time, a franchise coming to terms with loss at the same as its fictional characters. Chadwick Boseman, who in the previous adventure had played T’Challa, king of Wakanda, died of cancer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/29/black-panther-actor-chadwick-boseman-dies-of-cancer">two years ago at just 43 years old</a>. Now this new film pays a heartfelt and decent tribute to his memory in a drama shaped around this sudden blow, making an honest attempt to shape a superhero film around the subject of grief.</p><p>T’Challa’s sister Shuri now has to step up to a quasi-regency role alongside her grief-stricken mother Ramonda, who now becomes queen because T’Challa has suddenly died; here are two typically elegant and charismatic performances from Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett, with Wright’s Shuri now stricken not just with sadness but a new kind of bleak self-knowledge. Despite her renown as a scientist, she could do nothing to prevent or even understand T’Challa’s fatal illness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/08/black-panther-wakanda-forever-review-chadwick-boseman-letitia-wright-marvel">Continue reading...</a>

I was always a fan – I never really knew them personally until Nels Cline joined our band, and he was friends with Alan [Sparhawk], so Alan started coming around to see us play. We just got to be friends and at some point we toured together, and they asked me to produce a record with them, and I guess that’s when we became pretty close, or closer than just being fellow travellers.<br /><br />I think most people would look at Mimi and not estimate that she was a serious artist. I don’t think she put on any kind of pretension – there was nothing about her that read as anything other than normal midwesterner. That is my favourite thing on earth, when normal people reveal their depths of emotional understanding, and her poignancy was enhanced by the fact that she was so casual about her genius.<br /><br />I’ve never seen anybody be that casually brilliant. She was a giant – when I close my mind’s eye and imagine her voice, it rings the clearest to me of any voice I’ve heard in my life. Her voice was so indelibly defined. There’s something truly sacred about the way she sang and savoured notes, almost as a form of meditation – the way that she and Alan could breathe together and make this music that was secular church music, or something. Being around it and witnessing it is just astonishing, because it was so effortless and it was with zero pretence. For Mimi, it was just a way to live.<br /><br />Low, Alan, Mimi, have just been for me, for a long time, a bar to aim for – to make music that makes me feel the way their music makes me feel. Even before I met them their music was doing that for me, and certainly after working with them there was an added amount of inspiration in being accepted by them.<br /><br />The thing I keep thinking about Mimi is that she savoured every note, and I’m glad – there wasn’t a single note that was ever rushed, and that gives me some comfort, knowing that she had the presence of mind to sing with such grounded appreciation of each note she got to sing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/08/she-was-so-casual-about-her-genius-musicians-on-lows-mimi-parker">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Born in Bradford but raised in Bangladesh, the artist paints children playing on swings, seesaws and climbing frames to makes subtle points about race, empire and excluded faces</p><p>If you think of the canonical paintings of children in western art, their subjects are overwhelmingly white, cherubic baby Jesuses or aristocratic offspring overdressed in finery to reflect their parents’ status. Which is one reason why British artist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/sep/12/mixing-it-up-painting-today-review-hayward-gallery-london">Matthew Krishanu</a>’s sparse, dreamlike paintings of young brown boys roaming free and having adventures in subtropical climes – loosely based on himself and his brother as children – feel so fresh and compelling. “The motivation even to represent these figures,” Krishanu says in his London studio, “and have them on the walls of galleries around the world, is a response to the historical disempowerment of the brown figure, and of children, within western art.”</p><p>Childhood and the histories of empire are central themes for the artist, who was born in Bradford to an Indian mother and white British father and lived from the ages of one to 12 in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where his parents worked as missionaries. These experiences have been distilled into ethereal vistas of the brothers boating, exploring landscapes of rushing water and purple mountains, as well as interior scenes of missionary activity in Dhaka.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/nov/08/seesaw-painter-power-playground-race-empire-excluded">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The scandals pile so high the Tories hope we can’t keep track of them. But outside the walls of Westminster, anger is mounting</p><p>Many of the people who have been prime minister in the past six years seem to have internalised the idea that we’re sleepwalking towards an apologetically British form of tinpot dictatorship. After all, each of them has spent a remarkable amount of their time in office saying out loud: “I really don’t think the public wants an election.”</p><p>Perhaps the arc of history is bending towards them being right. As discussed here previously, a recent poll found that <a href="https://twitter.com/JLPartnersPolls/status/1567443028364742658?s=20&amp;t=m42W8ZavJhRptqFYTZEISQ">61% of 18- to 34-year-olds</a> supported running the UK with “a strong leader who doesn’t have to bother with parliament/elections”. Which doesn’t feel like the most ringing endorsement of whichever form of democracy we currently practise (constitutional experts/dadaists are invited to get in touch to clarify). We have an unelected second chamber and the second mandate-free prime minister in just over two months. Meanwhile, the former health secretary who spent most of the pandemic telling everyone how to behave has absconded from his post as a member of parliament, and is currently poised to pocket a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/how-much-matt-hancock-paid-celebrity-b2218996.html">rumoured £400,000 </a>fee to enter the I’m A Celebrity jungle, where he claims to want to talk to the public about dyslexia.

<p><strong>Bernard B Jacobs Theatre, New York</strong></p><p>Solid performances and rock’n’roll nostalgia can’t overcome lackluster lyrics and source material flaws in the musical adaptation of the 2000 film</p><p>Almost Famous, Cameron Crowe’s semi-autobiographical film in which a 15-year-old aspiring journalist cuts his teeth on the road with an up-and-coming rock band, is not an obvious choice for a Broadway musical despite being predominantly about music. Or, more accurately, about musicians and devotion – a charitable reading of the film, whose fans I’m not convinced overlap that much with musical theater, would say it pondered the ineffable qualities that make a star. The difference between a good band and a great one, a solid night onstage and magic, poser and cool.</p><p>Like just-good bands, the new Broadway version, adapted by Crowe with music and lyrics by Tom Kitt, has some of the right ingredients – overall convincing performances, kinetic choreography, the sheen of nostalgia, both for the 2000 film and 70s rock’n’roll. But the overall chemistry is lackluster, bound to elicit more shrugs than screams.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/nov/08/almost-famous-musical-review-cameron-crowe-broadway">Continue reading...</a>

Email <a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com">feast@theguardian.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>What can I </strong><strong>do to soup</strong><strong> to make </strong><strong>it more interesting?<br /></strong><em><strong>Helen, Oxford<br /></strong></em>“You could really go down the rabbit hole with this,” says Portuguese chef <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nuno-mendes">Nuno Mendes</a> of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/15/lisboeta-london-w1-the-custard-tasted-like-bacony-trifle-restaurant-review">Lisboeta in London</a>. Soups are transformed by the addition of crunchy, creamy, fresh and/or herby things, he says, but you can go as simple (yoghurt, soft-boiled eggs, toasted nuts) or fancy (fish tartare) as you like. Smooth vegetable soups always welcome some extra veg at the end, Mendes says – he suggests finely dicing some more of the veg you used as the base for the soup, then mix it with fresh herbs and lemon zest and spoon on top. “Or blitz raw cauliflower or broccoli into ‘couscous’, season and add herbs,” he adds. Veg scraps, too, can give many a soup a lift, says Lucy Carr-Ellison, co-founder of <a href="https://www.wildbytart.com/">Wild by Tart</a>: “Use carrot tops to make a pesto, or shred raw beetroot tops and mix with olive oil and lemon juice.”</p><p>Root veg soups pair happily with fruit in various guises. Mendes floats orange segments on top of his borscht-style beetroot soup, then tops it with a little olive oil and chervil, for instance, while Ramael Scully, executive chef and co-owner of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/may/12/jay-rayer-restaurant-review-ramael-scully-mayfair">Scully</a> in London, suggests a scattering of pomegranate seeds pickled in red-wine vinegar, pomegranate juice, sugar and a touch of water to go on top of pumpkin soup. Ferments, too, will give the likes of rich parsnip soup a welcome kick, with Mendes adding chopped kimchi, brown butter and toasted pine nuts to his.</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

We also heard an enthusiastic and bombastic speech from the former prime minister Boris Johnson – and a rather tepid and uninspiring one from the current prime minister, Rishi Sunak.</p><p>Climate justice and financing for loss and damage was a main theme of the day, and is likely to be so for the fortnight to come, as those from the countries most affected by climate breakdown ask for the help of carbon-spewing richer nations.</p><p>Johnson <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2022/nov/07/boris-johnson-cop27-climate-summit-net-zero-video">made a dramatic entrance</a>, speaking to the New York Times and seeming to make political hay out of the fact Sunak did not originally plan on coming to Cop. He said we were failing on our commitments made at Glasgow, such as reversing deforestation, and that at the current rate we would not meet climate targets.</p><p>Damian Carrington reported on an interesting row over gas. In short, some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/african-nations-set-to-make-the-case-for-big-rise-in-fossil-fuel-output">African countries want to use fossil fuels</a> to power development and bring electricity to the many people who lack it.

While looking at the online agenda for the opening ceremony, we spotted that the king was listed as speaking. Could he be making a surprise video appearance, like that by the late queen at Cop26 last year? We asked the palace, and it said he was listed in error.

She said: “What is needed to make [green technology] is already located and extracted in the global south and sent to the north. And then we have to be at the mercy of those who want to export to us.”</p><p>The Pakistani envoy, Nabeel Munir, pushed for climate justice. “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/05/climate-loss-and-damage-why-its-such-a-big-deal-at-cop27">Loss and damage</a> is not charity, it’s climate justice,” she said.</p><p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, agreed, saying that wealthier countries less affected by climate breakdown should pay up, and vowed that the Ukraine war would not stop French progress on climate targets.</p><p>Sunak chose to spend his bilateral discussions with Macron and the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, talking about boats in the Channel, and made an impassioned speech to broadcasters about tackling migration.</p><p>He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/07/cop27-sunak-says-it-is-morally-right-for-uk-to-honour-climate-pledges">then made a speech criticised as “tepid”</a> about the climate emergency, saying acting was the “right thing to do”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/08/what-happened-on-first-day-cop27-climate-summit">Continue reading...</a>

## Beth Mead: ‘People said last year was revenge but it was more of a love tour’

<p>Arsenal and England striker on dealing with her mother’s cancer, Olympic Games heartbreak and the Sarina Wiegman effect</p><p>“It shows how much more powerful love can be than hate,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/03/englands-beth-mead-will-not-support-qatar-mens-world-cup">Beth Mead</a> says as she reflects on a year of tumult and glory which has changed her life. The Arsenal striker won the Golden Boot and Player of the Tournament awards as she helped England become European champions in the summer but also had to endure the pain of her mother’s cancer and the upsetting memory of how, last year, she had been excluded from the GB squad at the Olympics.</p><p>Those football woes, and her worry and care for her mum, meant that Mead began last season in a frame of mind which, I suggest, seemed to fuse anger and love. The 27-year-old replaces “anger” with an even starker word in “hate” as she conveys her hurt. “I would say me hating that situation I was in [after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/14/arsenal-beth-mead-olympics-barcelona-sarina-wiegman-england">missing the Olympics</a> and with her England future unsettled] was my main motivator in pre-season. But the perspective of what my mum is going through meant I needed to snap out of it, stop being a baby and enjoy my football again. I wanted to find the enjoyment I had as a six-year-old girl when I started playing football.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/08/beth-mead-arsenal-england-interview-love-tour-not-hate">Continue reading...</a>

Those covers contained promises LeBron has since fulfilled many times over in Cleveland, Miami and Los Angeles.

Well, LeBron’s son Bronny is finding that out right now, especially when it comes to the 18-year-old’s dreams of following in his father’s footsteps as an NBA player. Bronny is the same age as his father when LeBron decided to turn pro and enter his name into the NBA draft out of high school (something no longer allowable by the league’s rules). It remains early for Bronny, of course, but the results have been mixed. And while he almost certainly will not end up one of the best players of all time like LeBron, he has already earned his fair share of accolades – something the sons of other legends like, say, Michael Jordan have been unable to achieve.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/08/lebron-james-bronny-james-talent-nba-college-career-basketball">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former president has been dropping heavy hints that he’s going to attempt a comeback. With luck he and arch-rival Ron DeSantis will rip the Republicans apart </p><p>You know how the saying goes: if at first you don’t succeed then sulk like a toddler, baselessly claim that an election was stolen from you, then try, try again. After lots of will-he-won’t-he it now seems almost certain that Donald Trump will run for president in 2024. Last Thursday, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/11/donald-trump-kellyanne-conway-2024">Kellyanne Conway</a>, Trump’s 2016 campaign lead, said that we can expect Trump to announce his candidacy soon and rumours have been flying ever since. Over the past few days, Trump advisers have been dropping <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3723387-talk-of-early-trump-2024-announcement-heats-up-with-monday-bid-a-possibility/">hints</a> to the media that the former president <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-considering-launching-fresh-white-house-bid-after-midterm-elections-2022-11-03/">will run</a> and Trump himself has been teasing a comeback at events across the country. On Monday, shares of the company that will take <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/trump-linked-stocks-rally-possible-2024-presidential-run-2022-11-07/">Trump’s social media venture public</a> rallied in anticipation of the idea that the guy who reportedly drinks <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/11/health/diet-coke-trump-health-effects">12 Diet Cokes a day</a>, likes to flush <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/08/donald-trump-blocked-toilets-photographs-documents-book">White House documents down the toilet</a> and is mired in multiple lawsuits, might become the most powerful man in the world again.</p><p>So when will Trump make this cursed announcement? Probably as soon as I file this column, knowing my luck. And I’m not the only one nervous about Trump’s timing. A number of Republicans <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/07/trump-spooks-republicans-with-talk-presidential-launch-eve-vote/">reportedly</a> spent Monday frantically calling up Trump and begging him not to announce his candidacy until after Tuesday’s midterm elections. The worry among some Republicans is that Trump’s news would overshadow the midterms and send Democratic voters scrambling to the polls. Trump, in an unusual display of self-restraint, has suggested that we should all mark our calendars for <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/11/08/donald-trump-president-election-2024-announcement">15 November</a> when he’ll make a “very big” announcement from Mar-a-Lago. “We want nothing to detract from the importance of tomorrow,” he added, as he made an announcement he knew was guaranteed to make headlines and steal at least some attention from the midterms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/08/donald-trump-2024-it-looks-like-its-happening-but-theres-a-silver-lining">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Operations on both sides will slow as it gets colder, but western-supplied artillery will make Russian troops a sitting target</p><p>Heavy rains in Ukraine are bringing the twice yearly <em>rasputitsa</em>, when mud breaks up unpaved tracks and makes many almost impassable; even tanks may be confined to the roads. Vehicle routes become predictable, and more easily targeted by artillery or drone and airstrikes. Snow and ice will follow in December, causing their own problems. Lack of foliage in wooded areas makes concealment from ubiquitous drones difficult, but by the same token, increased cloud cover will impede much aerial reconnaissance. Supplies and ammunition – including artillery shells – will take longer to arrive and will come in smaller quantities.</p><p>In short, winter means everything slows down.

<p>The majority of the Republican candidates for the House of Representatives are election-deniers – and a Republican-controlled Congress might attempt to sabotage the certification of the next presidential vote</p><p>Midterm elections are generally seen as less important than presidential elections. The stakes seem lower, which means fewer people turn out to vote. Most of the time the party controlling the White House takes losses, and this predictability can make midterms seem less important too: what can one voter do against the strength of the political tides? But occasionally there are midterms whose stakes rise beyond whether or not the president’s party will be able to pass new laws, and instead concern the whole future of the American republic. This year is one of them.</p><p>That’s because this year, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/10/06/elections-deniers-midterm-elections-2022/">the majority</a> of Republican candidates running for Congress, governor’s mansions, and other key statewide offices have denied or questioned the results of the 2020 presidential election.

<p>The English National Ballet soloist on the pandemic, director Tamara Rojo’s departure, the magic of one’s own big toe – and her university degree</p><p>Precious Adams likens being a dancer to having fibre optic cables running through her body. “Our mind-body connection is on another level,” she says. “Even after all these years you’ll become suddenly aware of some new muscle and fire it up, like, I didn’t know I could switch my deep rotators on so intensely!” A few years ago, a coach told Adams to think about pressing her big toenail down to the floor for stability, “And suddenly it gave me the most control over my whole body; the magic answer. Was I totally unaware of my big toe this whole time?!”</p><p>Adams, originally from Detroit, did her first dancing around the living room to a Vengaboys CD, but went on to train in Canada, Monaco and Moscow before joining English National Ballet in 2014.

While those filmed, especially the local soldiers, clearly disagree with America’s withdrawal from the region, the film itself tries to maintain a posture of journalistic neutrality.

<p>A senior civil servant claims Gavin Williamson told them to ‘slit your throat’ in what they felt was a  campaign of bullying</p><p><strong>Mel Stride</strong>, the work and pensions secretary, drew the Downing Street short straw this morning and was on the airwaves having to defend Sir Gavin Williamson, as well as taking questions on other matters. “Defend” is probably the wrong word, because Stride’s support for his colleague was half-hearted at best, and in key respects he cut him loose. Here are the key points.</p><p><strong>Stride said it would have been “utterly, utterly unacceptable” if Williamson had told a senior civil servant to “slit your throat” and “jump out of the window”. </strong>He told Sky News:</p><p>If that is the case, that is utterly, utterly unacceptable, but at the moment it is in the realm of media speculation.</p><p><strong>Stride confimed that Williamson’s messages to Wendy Morton were now the subject of a parliamentary investigation.</strong></p><p><strong>Stride said that a decision about Williamson’s future could be taken once the inquiry was over. </strong>He also suggested there could be further inquiries. He said:</p><p>I think the important thing we do now is not to start intervening ... and opining on who’s right and wrong or what may or may not have happened, but to wait for the results of that investigation.</p><p>And then when we have that, and any other investigation that may be triggered in the meantime, then I think we can take stock and come to a firm conclusion.</p><p><strong>Stride stressed that no minister was unsackable.</strong></p><p><strong>Stride said that Williamson, a former chief whip, deserved a seat at the cabinet table because of his understanding of Tory MPs.</strong> He told Times Radio:</p><p>I think Gavin is somebody who … has particular talents and a particular understanding of the parliamentary party.</p><p><strong>Stride said that <a href="https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/gavin-williamson-investigation-abusive-messages-rishi-sunak">he “suspects” Williamson will still be a minister at Christmas.</a></strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/nov/08/gavin-williamson-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-latest-live-news">Continue reading...</a>

While it’s true that Emily Wilding Davison, the woman who would later be trampled beneath the King’s horse at Epsom, adored it, feeling that it breathed the very “spirit of our women’s movement”, most modern readers tend to find it plodding and cliched, its story never quite flaring to life.</p><p>All of which presents something of an opportunity for Scarlett and Sophie Rickard, the sisters whose last book was a graphic adaptation of Robert Tressell’s equally earnest novel of struggle and socialism, <em><a href="https://rickardsisters.com/our-books/the-ragged-trousered-philanthropists/">The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists</a></em> – and boy, do they rise to it. In their hands, <em>No Surrender</em> is newly charming, its infelicities smoothed both by Sophie’s fleet way with speech bubbles and by Scarlett’s absolutely delightful illustrations. Every page looks splendid, whether we’re huddled in the kitchen of a tiny terrace in the fictional mill town where the story begins, or lazing in the summer sunshine on the expansive lawns of its more upper-class protagonists.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/08/no-surrender-by-scarlett-and-sophie-rickard-review-constance-maud-suffragettes-the-long-fight-for-womens-rights-revisited">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A Brooklyn installation shows every lie told by Donald Trump and his cronies about a ‘stolen election’</p><p>“I read this book called The Dictator’s Handbook, and if Trump could read, I’d have said he was going word-for-word from this book.” I’m talking with artist Phil Buehler, who recently installed a 50ft long banner called the Wall of Liars and Deniers, centered around Donald Trump’s “big lie” that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. Comprised of the tens of thousands of lies Donald Trump has made since being elected president, and culminating in Trump’s big lie, the project’s aim is to break through the desensitization that has inevitably set in after years of wall-to-wall coverage of Trump’s political career. “It’s really corrosive on our democratic system, that people stop believing in free and fair elections,” said Buehler. “It’s truly a danger to our democracy.”</p><p>The Wall of Liars and Deniers is a successor to another wall of Trump lies that Buehler created and installed in summer 2020. Buehler’s earlier project was called the Wall of Lies, and it documented some 30,000 lies Trump told while in office – it was an offshoot of a plan to spend a week reading out all of Trump’s lies on Radio Free Brooklyn that had been shelved due to the Covid pandemic.

<p>The writer’s vivid account of walking the Western Front Way illuminates the traumas of the first world war while reassessing his own tumultuous life</p><p>At the age of 68, the author and academic Anthony Seldon set out on a 1,000km trek in search of peace. He has always been restlessly ambitious. He has served as headmaster of Wellington College and vice-chancellor of the (private, though non-profit) University of Buckingham, while producing dozens of comment pieces for newspapers and books on recent history, including celebrated studies of post-second world war <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/apr/04/the-british-prime-minister-in-an-age-of-upheaval-mark-garnett-the-impossible-office-anthony-seldon-review">British prime ministers</a>. But by 2020 his hyperactive life had started to unravel.</p><p>His beloved wife, Joanna, had died of cancer and, after disputes with the board, Seldon decided to quit Buckingham, leaving him with “no job, no home, no wife”. Though he had often promoted “the teaching of happiness”, he realised, “enduring peace had so far eluded me. As long as I was busy, I got by. The swirl of activity kept me from introspection, from confronting my demons. Fear had been my constant companion… Could I change to a less manic gear? Writing a book on Boris Johnson, as planned, if I was to keep up my rhythm of books on recently departed prime ministers, would hardly help me do this.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/08/the-path-of-peace-walking-the-western-front-way-by-anthony-seldon-review-a-trail-of-painful-history">Continue reading...</a>

There genuinely are parents in the world who think nothing of calling their sons slang names for penis.” “Yeah, right,” everyone said, and we replied: “Hello? Dick much?”, and they said: “Dick Much? Is that your other ‘boyfriend’?”</p><p>Anyway, I split up with Jon Thomas (lol, no, we were never really going out, he was somewhat out of my league), while my sister stayed with Will Lee and now no one ever laughs at his name.

## ‘A stone circle older than Stonehenge’: Welsh forest walks steeped in folklore

<p>Celtic rainforests, druid sites and tales of an enchanted lake add wonder to these walks in nature</p><p>Take a walk through the woods and countryside of Wales and you enter a magical, liminal space – a threshold where history and legend, fact and fiction seem to merge and become one. Woodlands, caves, lakes and streams have long been at the heart of Welsh folklore. In some Welsh mythology they are believed to be gateways to the Annwn (the otherworld described most notably in the Middle Welsh text The Four Branches of the Mabinogi). These entrances were said to be protected by <em>Y Tylwyth Teg</em>, the fair folk. In Welsh folklore these fairies were the souls of druids who, as pagans, couldn’t be afforded passage to heaven but were too virtuous to be cast into hell. In other cases, nature provides power or protection.</p><p>I’d grown up listening to many of these tales. It wasn’t until I started a 300-mile walk through Wales, however, exploring, for a new book, how we as society can restore balance with nature, that I began to realise the importance of folklore. It reminds us of our long connections to the natural world – even as industrialisation and urbanisation distance us from it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/nov/08/a-stone-circle-older-than-stonehenge-wales-forest-walks-steeped-in-folklore">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In Fiji, the climate crisis means dozens of villages could soon be underwater. Relocating so many communities is an epic undertaking. But now there is a plan – and the rest of the world is watching</p><p>For the<strong> </strong>past four years, a special government taskforce in Fiji has been trying to work out how to move the country. The plan it has come up with runs to 130 pages of dense text, interspersed with intricate spider graphs and detailed timelines. The document has an uninspiring title – Standard Operating Procedures for Planned Relocations – but it is the most thorough plan ever devised to tackle one of the most urgent consequences of the climate crisis: how to relocate communities whose homes will soon be, or already are, underwater.</p><p>The task is huge. Fiji, which lies in the south Pacific, 1,800 miles east of Australia, has more than 300 islands and a population of just under 1 million. Like most of the Pacific, it is starkly susceptible to the impacts of the climate crisis. Surface temperatures and ocean heat in parts of the south-west Pacific are increasing <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/climate-change-increases-threats-south-west-pacific" title="">three times faster</a> than the global average rate.

<p>The Democrats have learned hard lessons over the years about what happens when election campaigns neglect the economy, so has the party been strong enough in its messaging for today’s midterm elections? Lauren Gambino reports </p><p>The midterm elections are usually bad news for the party in power. Voters often view them as a referendum on the president’s performance – and the state of the economy. So Democrats went into the campaign fearing the worst.</p><p>As the Guardian’s Washington correspondent <strong>Lauren Gambino </strong>tells <strong>Michael Safi, </strong>the Democratic party has learned the hard way to keep its election campaigns laser-focused on the economy. ‘It’s the economy, stupid,’ a slogan used in Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign, has resonated down the ages. But Democrats have spent much of the past few months campaigning on women’s rights after the seismic supreme court decision removing the constitutional right to abortion. And Joe Biden used his final major speech of the campaign to warn voters of the threat to democracy itself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/nov/08/us-midterms-is-it-still-the-economy-stupid-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
