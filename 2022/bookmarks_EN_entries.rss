<item><title>![CDATA[Google will pay $9.5 million to settle Washington DC AG's location-tracking lawsuit]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google/"><ins>Google</ins></a> has agreed to pay $9.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Washington DC Attorney General Karl Racine, who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-location-tracking-lawsuit-washington-dc-ag-143134940.html"><ins>accused the company earlier this year</ins></a> of &quot;deceiving users and invading their privacy.&quot; Google has also agreed to change some of its practices, primarily concerning how it informs users about collecting, storing and using their location data.</p><p>“Google leads consumers to believe that consumers are in control of whether Google collects and retains information about their location and how that information is used,” the complaint, which Racine filed in January, read. “In reality, consumers who use Google products cannot prevent Google from collecting, storing and profiting from their location.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Racine's office also accused Google of employing &quot;dark patterns,&quot; which are design choices intended to deceive users into carrying out actions that don't benefit them. Specifically, the AG's office claimed that Google repeatedly prompted users to switch in location tracking in certain apps and informed them that certain features wouldn't work properly if location tracking wasn't on. Racine and his team found that location data wasn't even needed for the app in question. They asserted that Google made it &quot;impossible for users to opt out of having their location tracked.&quot;</p><p>The $9.5 million payment is a paltry one for Google. Last quarter, it took parent company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/alphabet/"><ins>Alphabet</ins></a> under 20 minutes to make that much in revenue. The changes that the company will make to its practices as part of <a href="https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2022-12/2022.12.29%20DC-Google%20Settlement%20Agreement%20%5Bfor%20signature%5D.pdf">the settlement</a> may have a bigger impact.</p><p>Folks who currently have certain location settings on will receive notifications telling them how they can disable each setting, delete the associated data and limit how long Google can keep that information. Users who set up a new Google account will be informed which location-related account settings are on by default and offered the chance to opt out.</p><p>Google will need to maintain a webpage that details its location data practices and policies. This will include ways for users to access their location settings and details about how each setting impacts Google's collection, retention or use of location data.</p><p>Moreover, Google will be prevented from sharing a person's precise location data with a third-party advertiser without the user's explicit consent. The company will need to delete location data &quot;that came from a device or from an IP address in web and app activity within 30 days&quot; of obtaining the information</p><p>&quot;Given the vast level of tracking and surveillance that technology companies can embed into their widely used products, it is only fair that consumers be informed of how important user data, including information about their every move, is gathered, tracked, and utilized by these companies,&quot; Racine said in a statement. &quot;Significantly, this resolution also provides users with the ability and choice to opt of being tracked, as well as restrict the manner in which user information may be shared with third parties.&quot;</p><p>Engadget has contacted Google for comment.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-12-30T19:22:44+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.engadget.com/google-washington-dc-ag-location-tracking-settlement-192244812.html?src=rss</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.engadget.com/google-washington-dc-ag-location-tracking-settlement-192244812.html?src=rss</guid>

Though by acknowledging that, or by even acknowledging Klaus Schwab is a real person, authoritarian fanbois (the media, Big Tech, the Democrat Party, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/canadian-silenced-asking-about-wef" target="_blank">Canada</a>, Europe, etc.) call you a conspiracy theorist. Putting the word "Reset" after a word that's one better than "Good" wasn't invented by Alex Jones. It's the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/maajid-nawaz-rogans-great-reset" target="_blank">literal title of a Klaus Schwab book</a>.</p><p>Here is video of real person Klaus Schwab pledging to revolutionize a "global education" curriculum. Unclear is if this is a new video or a resurfaced one working its way around Twitter. But you can clearly see a real person saying real words with his mouth.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Klaus Schwab : <br /><br />“our education initiative… we have Cisco… and practically all the big names… we will revolutionize education…we will retrain the teachers… we will put a new curriculum in place”<br /><br />… so that we can indoctrinate the children with our ideology at an early age… <a href="https://t.co/PPSMIA1d5m">pic.twitter.com/PPSMIA1d5m</a><br />— Wall Street Silver (@WallStreetSilv) <a href="https://twitter.com/WallStreetSilv/status/1607929430164516864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Klaus Schwab, a global lobbyist, unelected to anything, has his hands in "practically all the big" corporations to retrain teachers and put a new global education curriculum in place. He doesn't say the word "indoctrinate," but feel free to draw your own conclusions. Schwab's comments are so alarming that Elon Musk -- who for all the leftist attacks on billionaires, seems to be the only one NOT on their side -- was taken aback.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Uhh …<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1607933340023230468?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Now, it's very easy to go down the rabbit hole of conspiracies when you have the internet in front of you. And WEF associates give us plenty to work on. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/wef-engineering-gender-away" target="_blank">Engineering away gender</a>. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/farmers-dutch-regulations" target="_blank">Making it impossible for farmers to grow food</a>. And my personal favorite? The CEO of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pfizer-ceo-misinformation" target="_blank">Joe Biden's favorite pharmaceutical company</a> bragging about a pill with a computer chip that alerts authorities when you've taken it. Quote, "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pfizer-ceo-pill-computer-chip" target="_blank">imagine the compliance</a>."</p><p>Because it's so easy to go down that rabbit hole, it's important to take a step back and check yourself on occasion. So I ask you...is there anything about this video that doesn't make Klaus Schwab -- in a real video where this real man said real words -- sound like Cobra Commander hatching a plan for global domination? Because I can't think of anything right now.</p><p><p>

<item><title>![CDATA[Tell HN: Google Maps location data is used for GeoIP updates]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Hi,<p>I've been meaning to write this for a few years now.
I saw https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34032484 and lots of great replies there - but I happen to have an insight which I kept track of for years now.<p>Some background first. Since more than a decade I've been using an always-on VPN on all my devices through a VPS I operate (various cloud providers along the years).
Also for context, I stopped using all google services around 2015 or thereabouts - although I still have an account I no longer use it.
The only google service that I use rarely is google maps - of course, never logged on.
And a few times a month I use google search for the odd obscure thing.<p>Around 2016 was the first time I noticed that google.com was showing at the bottom of the page my ZIP code. It felt very unusual but I was in the process of moving so I didn't pay too much attention. To my surprise, a few weeks later google.com was showing my new ZIP code.<p>I shopped around for cloud providers that would allow me to rotate the instance IP easily and thankfully there are many but I was curious how come google picked it up - the only plausible reason was using location data from the Google Maps iOS app.<p>Here's how you can replicate this.<p>Get a cheap VPS from a country different than yours. Get an iOS device (ideally an (older?) iPhone but I think it should work on an iPad) - Android devices should be excluded from this test for obvious reasons.
Reset it to factory defaults (optional but removes moving parts and false leads like cookies etc).<p>Install wireguard (or your preferred always-on vpn) and configure the VPS to be used as an exit node.
Install google maps (don't login of course) - can be used without being logged on just fine.
Install firefox focus (Safari in Private Window mode would work as well).<p>Confirm via ipinfo (or your preferred whatsmyip website) that you're using the VPS IP
Go to google.com and confirm it's showing at the bottom of the page the country of the VPS (could also be shown in a different language if google has a presence in that country).<p>Use the google maps app a few times a day (ideally navigate from a place to another) - it will take about 2-3 weeks but you'll notice that google.com will now show your actual country for the VPS IP and also the google.com language will change to your own.<p>If you want to take it one step further, continue to use google maps on the iOS device. You'll notice that after a few more weeks, google.com will show your actual City (based on the IP) - and after a while longer it will be even more precise, will show your ZIP code.<p>You have to be patient though, it will take 2-4 weeks to start with - and it's imperative that that IP address is dedicated to this test.<p>Funny enough, I was on holiday on Mexico for a month right before reading the HN article I mentioned (have been using a VPS in the states for lower latency) and I noticed that after 2 weeks the language changed to Spanish and google.com was showing Mexico (I rotated the IP when this happened and it prompted me to write this 'Tell HN'.<p>Not surprisingly but Google doesn't share the new GeoIP data - MaxMind, ipinfo and others never changed their location data for that IP - they showed the original geoip even a few weeks after google changed theirs - haven't checked longer than that - it could be shared eventually.<p>In conclusion - I can't say that I'm surprised Google is using the Maps location data - and I don't think there's any way to prevent it (outside of not running Maps - but unfortunately it's one of the few ways of checking restaurant reviews).
My "workaround" is to periodically rotate my VPS IP and move on with life :)<p>Thanks for reading - I hope you found this useful.</p>

I almost made it, and once I started it was easier than I thought</p><p>The digital age is changing us in ways we would never expect. If you had told me 20 years ago that I would one day stop reading books, I would have said you were crazy. I’ve always been a reader; from the time I was little, I would hide away somewhere with a book and devour it, often in one sitting. Cut to 2021, when I realized I had only read five books that year, and the previous year, only eight.</p><p>I didn’t have to wonder why. I already knew it was my phone. We see our phone’s own calculation of how many hours we’ve spent on it each day, and we can’t quite believe it. <em>What?</em> Hours, I realized, that I used to spend reading books. So I made a New Year’s resolution for 2022: more books, less phone. I set a goal for myself of fifty books.

  <p id="8sP0jc">WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg says the <em>New York Post</em>’s<em> </em>2020 story on Hunter Biden forced parent company Automattic to weigh difficult moderation questions for the WordPress VIP hosting service — although the company concluded it shouldn’t take any action on the story.</p>
<p id="uLTbNJ">In October 2020, the <em>Post </em>ran a report based on material it said came from an abandoned Biden laptop. Facebook and Twitter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515972/facebook-new-york-post-hunter-biden-story-fact-checking-reduced-distribution-election-misinformation">temporarily restricted links to the story</a> as questions about the provenance of the laptop’s content swirled: Facebook limited its spread under potential misinformation rules, while Twitter placed a more extreme ban on links to it, citing rules against posting hacked materials. (It had previously enforced those rules against <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301875/twitter-bans-blueleaks-ddosecrets-hacked-leaked-police-data-links">leaked police department...</a></p>

<item><title>![CDATA['Maybe because I'm from China...': Twitter shutting down Chinese employee's concerns over censorship says so much]]</title><description>![CDATA[<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=32332769&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C59%2C0%2C59" /><br /><br /><p>Twitter Files Part Five dropped on Monday. It looks at the two days when a "debate" was had amongst tweeps over permanently banning the President of the United States. The tl;dr of it all (<a href="https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1602364197194432515" target="_blank">even though you should</a>) is that a bunch of emotional hemophiliac Twitter employees who had wanted to ban Trump for years since -- he is literal Hitler literally -- shot their shot, and the brass at the bird app bent the knee. One lone employee from China said, "You know, I've seen this movie before... do not recommend."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="78656" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32332863&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>We already know <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-engineer-free-speech" target="_blank">Twitter's "commie as f*ck" employees don't believe in free speech</a>. However, one employee who is from communist China attempted to dissent during the company-wide Donald Trump is Over Party.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">7. There were dissenters inside Twitter. <br /><br />“Maybe because I am from China,” said one employee on January 7, “I deeply understand how censorship can destroy the public conversation.” <a href="https://t.co/LtonK0gfS3">pic.twitter.com/LtonK0gfS3</a><br />— Bari Weiss (@bariweiss) <a href="https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1602365655595962368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>Maybe because I am from China, I deeply understand how censorship can destroy public conversation.</blockquote><p>For an example of what the employee is talking about, please see: <em><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/china-protests-foreign-forces" target="_blank">Right the F*ck Now</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/china-protests" target="_blank">The Protests Happening in China</a></em>. Also, any <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/critical-race-theory-mom-chinese" target="_blank">person who has seen the left's preferred policies in IRL</a>. </p><p>While the commie-as-f*ck Twitter employees appreciated the input of the employee who has experienced it before, meh.</p><blockquote>I understand this fear, but I also think it’s important to understand that censorship by a government is very different than censorship of the government.</blockquote><p>The difference is when the government is being censored by an institution that has grown to be more powerful than most governments, it's worse.</p><blockquote>The first amendment in the U.S. exist specifically to prevent the government from silencing the people </blockquote><p>So, instead, the government works <em>with</em> a private company to silence the people on their behalf. That way, it's not "the government" silencing the people. It's a private company...filled with activist employees who agree with the government's political agenda. This started with the feds "asking" Twitter to censor a news story. It turned into the Biden Administration working with Twitter (and Facebook) directly.</p><p>The fact that a lone person from Communist China was the dissenter over a bunch of woke Americans is a little too on the nose.</p><p><p>

<item><title>![CDATA[The Great Climate Con | Alex Epstein | #312]]</title><description>![CDATA[Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Alex Epstein discuss the undeniable need for fossil fuels, the toxic underlying nihilism of the “climate concerned” left, the need for balance between conservation and human progress, and the unexplored worth of wild potential.

Alex Epstein is a philosopher and energy expert who argues that "human flourishing" should be the guiding principle of energy and environmental progress. He is the author of the new bestselling book Fossil Future: Why Global Human Flourishing Requires More Oil, Coal, and Natural Gas—Not Less. He is also the creator of EnergyTalkingPoints.com—a source of powerful, well-referenced talking points on energy, environmental, and climate issues.

📚 OUR COURSE/MEMBERSHIP: http://jointheorder.co/

You are being lied to about inflation. In fact, you're being told two main lies: the first is how high inflation actually is. But the second is who is truly responsible for a large part of inflation happening.

When we hear about inflation, we're told that it's primarily caused by the simple economics of money in the system. More money is printed, resulting in dollars becoming devalued, resulting in stuff getting more expensive. And yes, this is definitely a part of the inflation equation. However, there's a part that's often missed that in many cases, causes prices around us to rise as well.

To put it simply, it's all about corporate greed. And the desire of many companies to use inflation as a cover story for rising prices, so they can line their pockets. It's only possible they can do this due to lack of competition, which is something we don't think we have in today's world.

I'd love to hear your thoughts below.

0:00 - The big lies about inflation
0:55 - LIE 1: How high inflation really is
3:00 - The main narrative around inflation
3:26 - LIE 2: What is causing inflation
5:17 - Why competition is a myth
6:59 - Concentration of corporate power

The Pentagon has <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3239378/department-of-defense-announces-joint-warfighting-cloud-capability-procurement/">awarded</a> the companies separate contracts for the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) project, and according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/pentagon-awards-9-bln-cloud-contracts-each-google-amazon-oracle-microsoft-2022-12-07/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, they will have a shared budget ceiling of $9 billion. This initiative is a successor to DOD's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/department-of-defense-cancels-jedi-contract-172009337.html">cancelled Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure</a> (JEDI) program that was supposed to connect its different divisions using a single cloud service provider.&nbsp;</p><p>If you'll recall, the department awarded Microsoft with the $10 billion JEDI contract in 2019. Shortly after that, though, Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-14-amazon-microsoft-jedi-contract-protest.html">challenged</a> Microsoft's victory in court, claiming that the evaluation process had &quot;clear deficiencies, errors and unmistakable bias.&quot; Amazon argued back then that the Pentagon's decision was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-09-amazon-jedi-lawsuit-trump-vendetta.html">based on</a> &quot;egregious errors&quot; and &quot;the result of improper pressure from President Donald J. Trump.&quot; The company accused the former President of launching &quot;repeated public and behind-the-scenes attacks&quot; against it in an effort to steer the Pentagon away from giving the JEDI contract to Jeff Bezos, &quot;his perceived political enemy.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the Pentagon's inspector general office had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pentagon-trump-amazon-jedi-contract-162147083.html">found no evidence</a> that Trump interfered with the selection process, it also noted that several White House officials did not cooperate with its investigation. In the end, the department chose to cancel the JEDI project because it &quot;no longer meets its needs.&quot; Now, under the JWCC, the Pentagon will work with several vendors for the cloud capabilities and services it needs instead of with just a single one.</p><p>The companies' contracts will run until 2028 and will provide the DOD access to centralized management and distributed control, global accessibility, advanced data analytics and fortified security, among other capabilities.&nbsp;</p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-12-08T12:40:13+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.engadget.com/amazon-google-microsoft-oracle-pentagon-9-billion-cloud-jwcc-124013963.html?src=rss</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.engadget.com/amazon-google-microsoft-oracle-pentagon-9-billion-cloud-jwcc-124013963.html?src=rss</guid>

You could opt out of targeted ads on Facebook or Instagram if you'd rather not have the social networks track your activity. You can already decline customized ads using data from third-party apps and sites.</p><p>The board's decision wouldn't directly force Meta to change. Rather, it would ask Ireland's Data Protection Commission to apply matching orders. As Meta's European operations are officially based in Ireland, the company would have to comply.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both data boards acknowledged that there had been decisions, but didn't comment on what they entailed. We've asked Meta for comment. A spokesperson for the social media giant said it was "too early to speculate," and that the EU might still offer legal backing for targeted ads. The company argued that it had "fully" engaged with the Data Protection Commission's inquiries.</p><p>If the EU does restrict Meta's personalization, it could have a significant impact on the company's bottom line. With fewer users willing to accept targeted ads, there may be fewer people clicking those ads and encouraging advertisers to spend more on campaigns. Meta was already worried about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-ios-app-tracking-notices-192117307.html">Apple's App Tracking Transparency</a>, and warned that it might cost $10 billion in sales when it launched in 2021. The reported European measure could also prove costly, especially as it would affect Android and the web.</p><p>The EU might not be very sympathetic, as its officials have penalized Meta more than once for purported privacy violations. It faced a $402 million fine in September over allegedly illegal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-fined-405-million-euro-instagram-privacy-161348122.html">child privacy settings on Instagram</a>, and just last month received a $277 million fine for supposedly inadequate <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-fined-265-million-euros-over-data-scraping-142937633.html">safeguards against data scraping</a>. That's on top of an investigation into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-uk-probe-google-meta-ad-collusion-jedi-blue-113239217.html">possible collusion with Google</a> on display ads. Simply speaking, the Union is determined to prevent Meta's data from trading hands without consent.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-12-06T17:20:15+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.engadget.com/eu-meta-personalized-ads-ban-172015041.html?src=rss</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.engadget.com/eu-meta-personalized-ads-ban-172015041.html?src=rss</guid>

As we walked, he warned me that my colleagues at El Faro, the Salvadoran news organization, were being followed because of a story they were pursuing about negotiations between the president of El Salvador and the notorious MS-13 gang.</p><p>This may read like an eerie movie scene, but there are many Central American journalists who have lived it for real.

<item><title>![CDATA[Show HN: SinglePage – Quickly and anonymously publish a page to the web]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Creating a basic webpage has become way too complicated and expensive. Often there are those times when you just want to share your thoughts with the world but don't want the overhead and complexities that come with maintaining a website. Sometimes, you have an interesting thought piece, an education article, or just a quick and simple bio page that doesn't need the heavy hand of a WordPress blog or Medium post. That's where Single Page comes in. Publish a single page instantly to the web with no fuss.<p>I was laid off three weeks ago from Twitter and I decided to work through a couple of my projects and this was one of them. I've tried blogs over the years, Medium didn't feel right but yet I wanted to quickly post pages online and couldn't find an easy way to do it. So I created it.<p>Feedback appreciated!</p>

<item><title>![CDATA[Sony steps into the Metaverse with the 'Mocopi' motion tracking system]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Sony has launched an interesting product called <a href="https://www.sony.jp/CorporateCruise/Press/202211/22-1129/">Mocopi</a>, consisting of six motion-tracking bands worn on your hands, feet, back and head, with a price of 49,500 yen (about $358). The aim is to let you track your body to create videos or operate avatars in real time with metaverse apps like VRChat. It even offers an SDK that lets you import motion data into 3D animation apps.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently a play on the term "mocap," (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-07-14-motion-capture-explainer.html">motion capture</a>) Mocopi's six color-coded, lightweight motion sensors use "proprietary technology and a smartphone" with a dedicated app, according to Sony. "Normally, video production using motion capture requires dedicated equipment and operators," Sony wrote. "By utilizing our proprietary algorithm, 'Mocopi' realizes highly accurate motion measurement with a small number of sensors, freeing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber">VTubers</a> [virtual YouTubers] and creators involved in movie and animation production from time and place constraints."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="1aeb3047258e427c807db04c2fc51ab3"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>On December 15th, Sony will provide a software development kit (SDK) that links the motion capture data with metaverse services, along with the real-time development platform <a href="https://www.engadget.com/unity-weta-digital-acquisition-231256259.html">Unity</a> and Autodesk's animation/mocap app <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=391d1b55-7611-44fb-b248-64dc5a6ce032&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Autodesk&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzOTFkMWI1NS03NjExLTQ0ZmItYjI0OC02NGRjNWE2Y2UwMzIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXV0b2Rlc2suY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL21vdGlvbmJ1aWxkZXIvb3ZlcnZpZXc_dGVybT0xLVlFQVImdGFiPXN1YnNjcmlwdGlvbiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmE1NzkzMDMtZjE0Zi00NTEwLTgwNTktMjM2ZDdhNjNlYmVjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdvjdKdO626nNgM7XjfH9yXFnHpEfQ7xGMoYHzp7cGT9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autodesk.com%2Fproducts%2Fmotionbuilder%2Foverview%3Fterm%3D1-YEAR%26tab%3Dsubscription">MotionBuilder</a>. "This SDK expands the use of motion data for activities such as full-body tracking, thereby facilitating the development of new services in areas such as the metaverse and fitness."</p><p>In a how-to video (below), Sony shows how you can pair the sensors with the app, strap them to your body and calibrate them. From there, you can start dancing or do other movements and see the in-app avatars ape your actions. A second video showcasing some avatar animations (above) looks good, but does reveal typical motion capture issues like jitter and foot sliding.&nbsp;</p><div id="undefined"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>It's an ambitious product aimed at not only people interested in the metaverse, but animation professionals and filmmakers as well. Sony notes that you can use existing VRM avatars and export recorded videos in the MP4 format, provided you have a device with iOS 15.7.1 or Android 11. Reservations are set to start in mid-December 2022 and it will go on sale in late January 2023, but there's no word yet on North American availability.&nbsp;</p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-11-29T13:17:21+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.engadget.com/sony-mocopi-movement-tracker-metaverse-avatars-131721036.html?src=rss</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.engadget.com/sony-mocopi-movement-tracker-metaverse-avatars-131721036.html?src=rss</guid>

The Google Search search engine is dying. The giant that shaped the internet for the last 20 years is being consumed from the inside by SEO, lack of quality information, the emergence of platforms and no more avenues for growth.

This is how they'll possibly take our financial freedom,  via a CBDC. CBDC stands for Central Bank Digital Currency, and is a new form of digital money that is on the horizon for just about every nation on Earth.

CBDCs have already been launched fully in 11 countries, but are being tested in more than 100, including in nations that account for more than 95% of our planet's total GDP. In other words, if a CBDC hasn't hit your country yet, it very likely will soon. The criticism around CBDCs is that they will be used as the ultimate tool of surveillance and control, allowing governments to monitor citizens' every move. However, the United States and the Netherlands are already implementing laws to do just that, potentially requiring new reporting standards on almost all transactions.

The truth is, there may not be a lot we can do to stop a CBDC from arriving in our nations. But we can refuse to use one when they arrive, if they are as terrible for financial freedom as many believe.

In any case, I would love to hear your thoughts. And thank you for being here for 100 videos on this channel.

A planned economy is about to go full swing]]</title><description>![CDATA[On October 31st, 2022, China's Ministry of Housing and Construction and Ministry of Civil Affairs issued a joint notice requesting each city & region to select three to five communities to start a pilot project of building "a complete community." The plan is to implement the idea nationwide in two years' time. It’s to construct  "large packages" of essential services, including communal canteens. Previously, we reported that the Chinese government has been expanding supply and distribution cooperatives throughout the country. These are all signs that the planned economy version 2.0 is starting up in China after the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party ended.   
It showed that the Communist Party at that time wanted not only to implement a system of full and unrestricted public ownership in order to control the political and economic life of the entire society but also to impose a communal lifestyle, forcing its way into the private sphere and controlling the decisions of individual life.

<item><title>![CDATA[How Marxism is Disguised as Woke Morality | Dr. Yoram Hazony | #305]]</title><description>![CDATA[Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Dr. Yoram Hazony discuss the major problems plaguing today's youths, such as the resurgence of Marxism under the guise of woke morality, the creation of aimless social hierarchies that leave participants devoid of meaning, and the complete lack of respect for adverse thinking that has lead to the deterioration of our foundational principles.
 
Dr. Yoram Hazony is an Israeli author,  philosopher, political theorist, and Bible scholar. In 1994, Dr. Hazony founded the Shalem Center in Jerusalem, which became Shalem College in 2013. Being the first liberal arts college in Israel, it attracted widespread attention, followed by much acclaim as many of the country's renowned intellectuals joined its staff. Hazony has also served as director of the John Templeton Foundation's project in Jewish Philosophical Theology, as well as a member of the Israel Council for Higher Education committee. Dr. Hazony has published many books, his 2018 work, The Virtue of Nationalism, being awarded Conservative Book of the Year in 2019. He also maintains a regularly published blog, Jerusalem Letters, that explores the topics of philosophy, politics, Judaism, Israel, and higher education. Other writings by Dr. Hazony have been published in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and American Affairs.

<item><title>![CDATA[FBI reportedly considered using Pegasus spyware in criminal investigations]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>As recently as early last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was considering using NSO Group’s infamous Pegasus spyware in criminal investigations, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/12/us/politics/fbi-pegasus-spyware-phones-nso.html"><ins>reports </ins><em><ins>The New York Times</ins></em></a>. Between late 2020 and early 2021, agency officials were in the “advanced” stages of developing plans to brief FBI leadership on the software, according to internal bureau documents and court records seen by <em>The Times</em>. Those documents also reveal the bureau had developed guidelines for federal prosecutors detailing how the FBI’s use of Pegasus would need to be disclosed during court cases.</p><p>Based on the documents, it’s unclear if the FBI had considered using the spyware against American citizens. Earlier this year, <em>The Times </em>found that the agency had tested Phantom, a version of Pegasus that can target phones with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-group-spyware-us-state-department-report-183647765.html"><ins>US numbers</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>By July 2021, the FBI eventually decided not to use Pegasus in criminal investigations. That’s the same month that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/"><em><ins>The</ins></em><ins>&nbsp;</ins><em><ins>Washington Post</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>published an investigation that claimed the software had been used to compromise the phones of two women close to murdered Saudi journalist <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-spyware-targeted-journalists-politicians-190234376.html"><ins>Jamal Khashoggi</ins></a>. A few months later, the US placed Pegasus creator NSO Group on the Commerce Department’s entity list, a designation that prevents US companies from conducting business with the firm. Despite the decision not to use Pegasus, the FBI indicated it remains open to using spyware in the future.</p><p>“Just because the FBI ultimately decided not to deploy the tool in support of criminal investigations does not mean it would not test, evaluate and potentially deploy other similar tools for gaining access to encrypted communications used by criminals,” states a <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/nso-fbi-brief/f6199b0802b4fc01/full.pdf"><ins>legal briefing</ins></a> filed by the FBI last month.</p><p>The documents appear to present a different picture of the agency’s interest in Pegasus than the one FBI Director Chris Wray shared with Congress during a closed-doors hearing this past December. “If you mean have we used it in any of our investigations to collect or target somebody, the answer is - as I’m assured - no,” he <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/fbi-nso/58a69830f3cd2e7d/full.pdf"><ins>said in response to a question from Senator Ron Wyden</ins></a>. “The reason why I hedge, and I want to be transparent, that we have acquired some of their tools for research and development. In other words, to be able to figure out how bad guys could use it, for example.”</p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-11-12T19:55:12+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.engadget.com/fbi-reportedly-considered-using-pegasus-spyware-195512125.html?src=rss</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.engadget.com/fbi-reportedly-considered-using-pegasus-spyware-195512125.html?src=rss</guid>

China has the world's largest auto market, and investors are closely watching the performance of Tesla, the largest American electric car company, in China, where many believe the growth potential is far greater than in Europe or the US. 
It is a familiar pattern for the Chinese Communist government to use Western companies to improve China's industrial capabilities. But in the case of Tesla, China's economy has already begun to crumble before the CCP can complete its scheme, and the decline will only happen faster and faster. Tesla's China dream is destined to be lost, and the longer it stays entangled with the CCP, the greater the price it will likely pay.

Soon it will be joined by others in a development that could mean the end of thousands of jobs and, Amazon argues, the creation of thousands of others.</p><p>As the robot worked, a screen displayed its progress.

<item><title>![CDATA[Twitter starts doling out 'official' checkmarks - again]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Twitter's "official" gray checkmarks seem to making their way back to accounts owned by brands, publishers and other public figures. The website <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-official-verified-checkmark-154546497.html">initially rolled out</a> its official badges — the ones you can't buy with its new $8 Blue subscription service — on November 9th. But it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-kills-twitter-official-verified-checkmarks-175648560.html">paused deployment</a> and pulled them back down from accounts that already had them, including Engadget's, just a few hours later. Twitter VP Esther Crawford explained that the checkmarks will be back, it's just that the social network is going to hand them out to "government and commercial entities" at first.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/10/23452625/twitter-verified-official-blue-gray-check"><em>The Verge</em></a> reports, the badge has now started reappearing on brand and company accounts like Coca-Cola's and Nintendo of America's. Twitter's own accounts are also displaying the gray checkmark. And some publications like <em>The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg</em> and <em>Wired</em> have them now, as well. It's unclear if rollout has truly started this time, and if it has anything to do with the influx of impersonator and parody accounts that have flooded the website since its $8 verification has debuted.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Twitter" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/16cbe1a0-617d-11ed-aebe-c40290fda73b" style="height: 741; width: 800;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twitter</div></figure><p>Shortly after the company's paid verification scheme went live, fake accounts shelled out for a subscription and got themselves verified. That led to legitimate-looking accounts tweeting out questionable things, such as a fake Nintendo of America posting a picture of Mario giving Twitter the middle finger and a fake LeBron James announcing that he was requesting a trade. On its support account, <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1590471013154050048">Twitter said yesterday</a> that it was not "putting an 'Official' label on accounts" yet, but it's "aggressively going after impersonation and deception." The gray checkmark, however, could help people figure out if they're dealing with actual companies and public figures.&nbsp;</p><p>As a response to the situation, the company implemented a new rule that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blocks-new-accounts-twitter-blue-114446338.html">blocks accounts</a> created on or after November 9th from its $8 Blue subscription to prevent them from getting instant verification. Twitter owner Elon Musk also announced that going forward, accounts doing parody impersonation must include the word "parody" in their name, not just in their bio. That's been a part of <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/parody-account-policy">Twitter's policy for years</a>, but we're guessing the website will now be enforcing the rule more strictly in light of recent events.&nbsp;</p><div id="5b6e0388e2114287a565dfa77b0caf5a"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Going forward, accounts engaged in parody must include “parody” in their name, not just in bio</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1590884973535711232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-11-11T04:56:18+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.engadget.com/twitter-starts-doling-out-official-checkmarks-again-045618923.html?src=rss</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.engadget.com/twitter-starts-doling-out-official-checkmarks-again-045618923.html?src=rss</guid>

  <p id="Hfi8ZS">Elon Musk seems intent on turning Twitter into a bank, complete with what he describes as a “high-yield money market account,” debit cards, checks, and loans. He described his plans during a last-minute meeting with staff today, and you can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/10/23452196/elon-musk-twitter-employee-meeting-q-and-a">read a full transcript of that here</a>.</p>
<p id="lxIO6A">Musk broached the topic of payments during his introduction, saying that “I think there’s this transformative opportunity in payments,” adding that the goal is “enabling people on Twitter to able to send money anywhere in the world instantly and in real-time. We just want to make it as useful as possible.” He said that the feature, along with “video content and compensating content creators” and improving search, is a “high priority.”</p>

<item><title>![CDATA[Disney now matches Netflix's subscriber numbers across its combined services]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Disney+ has welcomed 12.1 million new subscribers for the company's <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disneys-fiscal-full-year-and-q4-2022-earnings-results-webcast/">fourth fiscal quarter</a> ending on October 1st, and according to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-earnings-q4-fourth-quarter-results-164357146.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90cmVsbG8uY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAknfTQfApjr_I_IewV3D0m_JHls6gGwATsRR9WS5qJ6YV-o2SGn7BKTcjaqM3NBnG7XW3STXHgeA4Xi-2pOOZ5ChIY5Kc3lsvSZxM4FbsRGcOld3-NDaHRvcZC4qFHtX8p6UVNANNog6z8zT938-bOOZXkZNbitTn2ZDGTa29FH"><em>Yahoo Finance</em></a>, that's 3 million more than analyst estimates. In all, Walt Disney added 14.6 million subscriptions for Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, bringing its total number of streaming subscribers so far to around 236 million. While Disney+ alone with its 164 million subscribers have yet to reach Netflix numbers, all three of the company's services combined had amassed members that can rival the streaming giant's. Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-adds-2-41-million-subscribers-soaring-past-expectations/">revealed</a> that it has around 223.09 million subscribers during its latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-begin-charging-extra-user-fees-early-next-year-221450520.html">earnings report</a> in October.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the impressive growth in subscriber number, Disney's operating loss for streaming increased from $0.8 billion to $1.5 billion for the quarter. Disney+ experienced more losses within the period due to higher production and technology costs, as well as an increase in marketing expenses. There were also no Premier Access releases for the quarter, such as last year's <em>Black Widow</em> and <em>Jungle Cruise</em>. That said, the losses were offset in part by higher subscription costs, which will become even higher in December.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Walt Disney CEO Bob Chapek said that the company expects its streaming losses to narrow going forward, thanks to its price increases and the launch of an ad-supported tier on Disney+. The company even believes that Disney+ is on track to achieving profitability in the fiscal year of 2024, assuming the lack of a "meaningful shift in the economic climate." If you'll recall, Disney is raising its streaming prices across the board this December, and the ad-supported tier for Disney+ is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-price-increase-ad-based-service-204903273.html">launching on December 8th</a> for $11 a month.&nbsp;</p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-11-09T05:54:15+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.engadget.com/disney-streaming-services-earnings-055415800.html?src=rss</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.engadget.com/disney-streaming-services-earnings-055415800.html?src=rss</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Why scientists are using the word scary over the climate crisis]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>The former BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin has spent his career talking to scientists. Now they’re telling him they’re scared of what they’re seeing</p><p>Back in the 1980s, when climate research began to really take off, scientists were desperate to retain their credibility as they unravelled the potentially dire consequences of the “new” phenomenon of global warming. Most journalists tiptoed round this topic because no one wanted to lose their reputation by scaremongering. But as the science steadily became overwhelming researchers pushed their conclusions in the face of policymakers. </p><p>More and more scientists are now admitting publicly that they are scared by the recent climate extremes, such as the floods in Pakistan and west Africa, the droughts and heatwaves in Europe and east Africa, and the rampant ice melt at the poles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/07/why-scientists-are-using-the-word-scary-over-the-climate-crisis">Continue reading...</a>]]</description><pubDate>2022-11-07T08:30:02+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/07/why-scientists-are-using-the-word-scary-over-the-climate-crisis</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/07/why-scientists-are-using-the-word-scary-over-the-climate-crisis</guid>

Michael Safi reports</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, <strong>Michael Safi</strong> went to meet a bank robber. She was about 5ft tall, in her late 20s, and wearing fluffy slippers. Her name is<strong> Sali Hafez. </strong>At the end of her tether, she took a plastic replica gun and a bottle of petrol and walked into a branch of her bank to demand they gave her the money in her account. She says the balance was over $100,000. They gave her $14,000.</p><p>Today we bring you the story of a bank robbery, but not that one. Instead, it is a story of how Lebanon’s banks became so dysfunctional that they had to prevent customers withdrawing their own money. The Reuters journalist <strong>Timour Azhari </strong>explains how the country’s entire banking system imploded after running what the World Bank has called a giant Ponzi scheme. For years, Lebanon encouraged foreign investment with the promise of high interest rates, but the war in neighbouring Syria and then the pandemic meant that when investors took fright, the whole financial system came tumbling down. And when that happened, it exposed to sunlight what had been happening all along: a carnival of plundering of the state’s assets by a ruling elite that has yet to confront the mess the country is in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/nov/07/who-is-robbing-lebanons-banks-podcast">Continue reading...</a>]]</description><pubDate>2022-11-07T03:00:36+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/nov/07/who-is-robbing-lebanons-banks-podcast</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/nov/07/who-is-robbing-lebanons-banks-podcast</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[More Chinese can't stand the CCP as the planned economy returns to China]]</title><description>![CDATA[#chinainsights #chinaeconomy #chineseprotest

Following the conclusion of the 20th Communist Party Congress, CCP Leader Xi Jinping was re-elected as General Secretary of the Party for a third term. But protests against him and against the CCP's policies have been growing among the masses. 
The CCP has again conducted strict investigations into "naked officials" before the 20th National Congress. Naked official refers to the CCP officials who stay in mainland China while their wives and children reside abroad. 
Many analysts believe that after the 20th National Congress, after the top level of the CCP has been reshuffled, it will be the turn of the lower and middle levels of the officialdom to reshuffle their positions and personnel.

The joke in that case is on the shareholders. Having hailed Mark Zuckerberg as a visionary, and having given him effective control on that basis through a form of “golden share” voting structure, investors were shocked to discover it is impossible to sack the boss when he pursues visions they do not like.</p><p>Meta’s share price is down 73% this year to its lowest level since 2015 for reasons that go beyond the general big tech sell-off. The stock has fallen so far because Zuckerberg is squandering tens of billions of the company’s dollars on building <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/27/metas-shares-dip-is-proof-metaverse-plan-never-really-had-legs-facebook">his mysterious “metaverse”</a> and appears determined to sink even more cash into the virtual reality black hole.

Or, at the very least, provide context those users feel might better inform other tweeps. And, for some unknown reason, there weren't many instances of Twitter users taking advantage of this function on Democrat tweets until <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aoc-free-speech" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> took over.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>The White House, or @WhiteHouse, discovered this the hard way. They posted a tweet: "Seniors are getting the biggest increase in their Social Security checks in 10 years through President Biden's leadership."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Dems are in disarray, so they trying to drum up fear <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-southern-accent" target="_blank">by scaring seniors about Social Security</a>. @WhiteHouse thought this would be a good tweet, forgetting that a) not many seniors use Twitter, b) it's a new day on Twitter where <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-closures-white-house" target="_blank">Democrats can get fact-checked</a>.</p><p>Twitter users added the following context: "Seniors will receive a large Social Security benefit increase due to the annual cost of living adjustment that, which is based on the inflation rate."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>Now, you may have noticed I provided a screen capture of the tweet in question and not the actual tweet. There is a good reason for that.

<item><title>![CDATA[UK police fail to use facial recognition ethically and legally, study finds]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Use of live facial recognition (LFR) by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-06-uk-police-arrest-automatic-facial-recognition.html">UK police forces</a> "fail[s] to meet the minimum ethical and legal standards," according to a <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/uk-police-fail-to-meet-legal-and-ethical-standards-in-use-of-facial-recognition">study</a> from the University of Cambridge. After analyzing LFR use by the Metropolitan (Met) and South Wales police, researchers concluded that the technology should be banned for use in "all public spaces."</p><p>LFR pairs faces captured by security cameras to database photos to find matches. China and other non-democratic regimes have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-07-us-entity-list-chinese-facial-recognition-video-surveillance.html">used the technology</a> to as part of their state surveillance tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>UK police have been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-24-london-police-live-facial-recognition-public-streets.html">testing its use</a> in multiple situations to fight crime and terrorism. In two cases, LFR was used by MET and South Wales police to scan crowds and compare faces to those on a criminal “watch list." In another, officers used FRT smartphone apps to scan crowds and identify "wanted individuals in real time," according to the paper.</p><p>In those cases, the team found that police "kept from view" information about how they use the data and information about demographics. That has in turn made it difficult to determine whether the tools are promoting racial profiling, while raising questions about accountability. "Police forces are not necessarily answerable or held responsible for harms caused by facial recognition technology," said lead author Evani Radiya-Dixit.</p><p>The Met has claimed that the latest algorithms have improved LRF accuracy, with false alerts less than .08 percent, according to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/27/live-facial-recognition-police-study-uk"><em>The Guardian</em></a>. They boasted of a 70 percent success rate up to 2020, but an expert from the University of Essex hired by the police force found it was actually just 19 percent.  "That the court of appeal explicitly stated in 2020 that South Wales police use of this technology was 'unlawful' makes it difficult to argue this technology should be used," he said.</p><p>However, the Met said its work was supported by law. "LFR is regulated by a number of sources of law. These sources of law combine to provide a multilayered legal structure to use, regulate and oversee the use of LFR by law enforcement bodies," it told <em>The Guardian</em>. UK's parliament has yet to weigh in, even though it's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-07-uk-data-protection-bill.html">created legislation</a> around internet privacy.</p><p></p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-10-31T08:20:39+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.engadget.com/uk-police-fail-to-use-facial-recognition-ethically-and-legally-researchers-say-082039619.html?src=rss</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.engadget.com/uk-police-fail-to-use-facial-recognition-ethically-and-legally-researchers-say-082039619.html?src=rss</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[YouTube suspended Louder with Crowder for our episode about Elon Musk's Twitter takeover]]</title><description>![CDATA[<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32019186&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C24%2C0" /><br /><br /><p>
	I’ve been here before, but this one is… very different. YouTube has issued yet ANOTHER hard strike to the channel. No specifics have been provided but they claim that our segment on Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover is a violation of their deliberately opaque guidelines.
</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

</p><p>Why is this one more severe than the others? Well, it’s our 2nd “strike” in 90 days. 3 strikes mean permanent removal.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="67b54" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=32019162&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Do you remember the reason for our last strike? <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/youtube-suspends-crowder-kari-lake" target="_blank">It was due to none other than Kari Lake pointing to election-related issues</a> for a primary IN WHICH SHE WON!!</p><p>
	Look, we are going into an election season. One where, if the scales of media were balanced, conservative Republicans would win in a landslide! They can’t have that.
</p><p>
	Make no mistake, there is a reason that these two strikes directly relate to:
</p><ul>
<li>A future governor who has spoken out against big tech</li>
<li>Support of a man (Musk) whose purchase and plan for a big tech platform would fundamentally allow more free and fair media coverage of elections.</li>
</ul><p>
	It’s also no coincidence that this happened as we were nearing 100,000,000 plays/downloads within 30 days. It’s not about the number. It’s about YOU choosing truth over their lies.
</p><p>
	So what do we do? Do we roll over and die? Hell no!
</p><p>
	Starting Monday through November 17th (back on YouTube on November 21st), we will be streaming <a href="https://rumble.com/c/StevenCrowder" target="_blank">exclusively on Rumble</a> and of course the extended show on <a href="https://get.blazetv.com/lwc/" target="_blank">Mug Club</a> as we always do.
</p><p>
	Make no mistake, the machine is in full force. They are deathly afraid of you and the tectonic shift which is beginning to take place in our country.
</p><p>
<span></span>Never give up, never surrender, and FIGHT LIKE HELL!!
</p><p>
	See you Monday.

  <p id="7TenCF">Elon Musk, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/27/23184519/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-deal-complete-agreement">Twitter’s new owner</a>, says the company is setting up a council to make important moderation decisions at the company. In <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1586059953311137792">a tweet on Friday</a>, Musk said the “council” will have “widely diverse viewpoints” and that “no major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.”</p>
<p id="zSptMG">Part of Musk’s professed reasoning for buying Twitter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/15/23025120/elon-musk-twitter-free-speech-government-censorship">hinged on making it a platform for “free speech,”</a> and he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/10/23065413/elon-musk-donald-trump-twitter-ban-lift">has said he’d consider</a> letting controversial figures like former president Donald Trump back onto the platform. With Friday’s announcement, it seems as if he’s placing that sort of decision into the hands of a council.</p>

The reshuffle of the Chinese leadership has spooked foreign investors. The next day, on Oct. 24th, Chinese stocks suffered their worst day in Hong Kong since the global financial crisis in 2008, as foreign investors rushed to sell Chinese stocks. Nearly all the stocks in the Hang Sheng index were lower, with Chinese internet and technology stocks being hit particularly hard. 
Analysts generally expect China's economy to slow in Xi's third term, not primarily because of the labor force demographics, productivity, real estate, etc. that drive growth, but because of the CCP's regressive economic policies.

  <p id="Pdtp5r">Kids who play video games have better memory and better control over their motor skills than kids who don’t, according to a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797596?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_term=102422">new study</a> looking at adolescent brain function. </p>
<p id="rQ34lM">Video games might not be responsible for those differences — the study can’t say what the causes are — but the findings add to a bigger body of work showing gamers have better performance on some tests of brain function. That lends support to efforts to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22976720/mental-health-video-game-treatment-deepwell-devolver-digital">develop games</a> that can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21292267/fda-adhd-video-game-prescription-endeavor-rx-akl-t01-project-evo">treat cognitive problems</a>. </p>
<p id="fZZqOJ">“This study adds to our growing understanding of the associations between playing video games and brain development,” said Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in a <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/video-gaming-may-be-associated-better-cognitive-performance-children">statement</a>. </p>

Six members of the European Parliament held a press conference on October 11, 2022, one day after Albert Bourla, Pfizer CEO, refused to participate in the Covid committee and answer questions.

YT guidelines

COVID-19 medical misinformation policy

https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9891785

Prevention misinformation: 

Content that promotes prevention methods that contradict local health authorities or WHO.

Claims that there is a guaranteed prevention method for COVID-19

Claims that any medication or vaccination is a guaranteed prevention method for COVID-19

https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/11161123

Vaccine safety: content alleging that vaccines cause chronic side effects, outside of rare side effects that are recognized by health authorities

Efficacy of vaccines: content claiming that vaccines do not reduce transmission or contraction of disease 

Ingredients in vaccines: content misrepresenting the substances contained in vaccines

MEP Virginie Jeron (France)

My colleagues have perfectly summarised the masquerade (farce) of yesterdays meeting

None of the questions we asked, which were very clear;

Contracts, prices, xxxxxx, were not answered.

Pfizer should be required to give evidence under oath

Because this is an official hearing.

This was the biggest contract ever awarded by the European Commission, E 36 billion 

European court paper, 35 pages of questions, criticisms, demands, lack of transparency – none answered

Suspicions of passive corruption, to be put into action 

I have contacted a legal firm in France

Summary, they came, they did not answer anything, and they are still selling us their products.]]</description><pubDate>2022-10-21T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSnQor8zDY</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSnQor8zDY</guid>

“WEF founder Klaus Schwab even wrote about it in a book entitled the Great Reset - that's where you'll own nothing and be happy,” Mr Bernardi said. 

“These same leaders celebrate movements that rely on deceit, destruction and chaos to divide society while a largely compliant media mostly report only the official interpretation of events.

He said “agents of political change” are now so emboldened they will “happily lie and seem to have no fear of being exposed”. 

“They will misrepresent everything, from war to science, from economics to biology, in order to condition you to endorse what is unacceptable," Mr Bernardi said. 

“These things are being done before our very eyes, and yet, most people refuse to see.”]]</description><pubDate>2022-10-07T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iy-YrmDMX4</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iy-YrmDMX4</guid>

So, web browser extensions all work in relatively the same way: they use a file called manifest.json. It's basically a description of the extension and a list of what it wants to do on your browser.

As of now, most browser extensions use manifest V2, and, as with all specifications, manifest v2 is being updated with manifest v3. Its biggest changes are in using service workers instead of background pages, and using a new API to block or modify network requests.

The new API is where the problem with manifest v3 lies.

Right now, with manifest v2, extensions have access to a feature called WebRequest. To summarize it quickly, it lets the extension look at the data going through a web browser, notably the calls it makes to various URLs, and it lets extensions act on them, stuff like blocking them, or modifying them.

This feature is the backbone of all privacy and adblocking extensions.

In Manifest v3, pushed heavily by Google, the Web Request API is gone. It's replaced by a new one called Declarative Net Request, and this new API basically prevents any extension from monitoring traffic. Extensions must declare in advance how they'll  handle certain types of requests, or they can't handle them at all. These extensions also won't be able to load code from outside of the currently displayed website.

It  means extensions lose some capabilities, notably the ability to act after the websitse server has answered the requests the browser made. Extensions need to say beforehand what they'll block, which means they need to know in advance what constitutes an ad or a tracker, and what isn't, when before, they could react in real time as the website called to various resources.

https://blog.chromium.org/2019/06/web-request-and-declarative-net-request.html

And that's where the problem is: this new API severely limits what browser extensions can do, and will make all ad blockers and privacy focused extensions a lot less useful.

https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening

This spec specifically destroys the capabilities of everything that currently hurts Google's business model.

Chrome and the chromium engine control the whole web. Chromium based browsers are about 85% of all desktop browsers. Globally, it's about 63% if we count mobile.

This means that extension developers, if they want their extension to reach users, HAVE to develop it for Chrome and chrome based browsers.

Firefox is compatible with Chrome extensions, mostly, and developers generally don't have a ton of work to do to ensure that their extension runs on it as well. But with manifest v3, developers will have to maintain 2 versions of their extensions. One that runs on Chrome and chromium based browsers, and one that runs on Firefox.

Why would you do some extra work to maintain your extension for a browser that has very little market share worldwide?]]</description><pubDate>2022-09-19T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KWCLhHrblE</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KWCLhHrblE</guid>

This is why Net Zero is a scam. One that is not only basically believed by the whole world, but one that is running our nations, and being bought and paid for by your tax dollars.

You've definitely heard of "Net Zero" before. It was first popularised during the Paris Climate Agreement in 2016, hosted by the United Nations. And while they likely have the best interests of our planet at heart, there are of course massive entities (especially the world's oil companies) who are taking advantage of Net Zero. Mostly, so they can make lots and lots of money.

The worst thing is, one of the solutions being heralded as our best choice for achieving these goals is carbon capture and storage. Which isn't basically doing anything at all. And is being use to make billions in extra dollars for oil companies.

Let me know your thoughts below.

1:02 - Where "Net Zero" actually came for
2:16 - How oil companies lie about Net Zero

Support independent research and analysis by joining my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone 

Huawei is the world’s largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment and one of the top smartphone makers in the globe. The Huawei empire now sells products or carries the traffic of Internet users in 170 countries. And for over a decade, the Shenzen giant faced and dismissed accusations that they have pwned billions of users on behalf of the authoritarian Chinese government. Whether or not there is a Huawei backdoor must be thoroughly scrutinized before any conclusion can be made. Hard evidence is scarce. This is an analysis of all major accusations and allegations of backdoor planted into Huawei products.

<item><title>![CDATA[Become Untraceable - How To Create An Anonymous Identity | Tutorial]]</title><description>![CDATA[Become untraceable by creating anonymous identities. This is how it's done. Support independent research and analysis by joining my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone 

The Internet is a giant network of privately owned spaces open to public, where every participant knows the exact identity and location of one another and where corporate stalking is a perfectly legitimate business model. If you are not okay with automated decisions being made about your every move, you should consider creating an anonymous identity.

Anonymity is the most powerful mitigation strategy on a publicly observable network such as the Internet. It is the most direct path towards privacy. This guide will tell you exactly what you need to know and do in order to create and maintain your very own anonymous identity. 

The Internet is a privacy nightmare because every action is by default identifiable and linkable. That means actions always lead to a unique location and/or account on the network and actions can built a profile over time. Linkability and identifiability are your biggest privacy and anonymity threats on the Internet. For maximum anonymity, both of these threats need to be mitigated to the fullest extent possible. 

Our first step with any service will be to dissociate our account details from our personal information. The second step is to compartmentalize our anonymous identities so that they are isolated from our personal identities.

Dissociation and isolation of your anonymous identities are not the only steps to keep your anonymity. Be extremely cautious of what types of data you submit to these services while using them. Always think of the linkability and identifiability threats when using these accounts.

*Some Copy about the Video for the YouTube Algorithm*

In this month’s video, we’re looking at Elon Musk’s attempted (and now seemingly aborted) purchase of Twitter.

In April 2022, Elon Musk offered to buy Twitter for $44 billion. His stated goals were two-fold: Firstly, to rid the social media network of bots and other fake accounts. Secondly, to ensure Twitter was doing all it could to protect “free speech” on its service.

Over the past six months, Musk has joined the legions of activists on the political right who bemoan what they see as an overly-stringent approach to content moderation (or what they usually describe as “censorship") on Twitter. They claim that this is stifling public discourse and taking away users’ rights to freedom of speech and expression.

But what would a Muskian Twitter actually have looked like? Could he have seen-through his plans for securing “free speech” on the platform? Or is it all a little bit more complicated than that.

Join me as we take a dive into the ways in which discussions around freedom of speech tend to fail, the history of the so-called “marketplace of ideas” and what all of this might mean for how we look back on the attempt by Elon Musk to buy Twitter.

<item><title>![CDATA['Based' Paganism vs. Christianity]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write about Paganism recently. I will frame it as a response to an email I received within the past day or so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Luke,</p>
<p>First off, I would like to thank you for all your efforts in making everything
you know accessible to everyone. You have exposed me to some of the most
thought-provoking people on the internet and Varg is one of them. I was
wondering if you can write an article or make a video on what you think about
Varg&rsquo;s Paganism in relation to you choosing Orthodox Christianity. I know that
you briefly talked about it in one of your livestreams, however, I would like
to better understand why you don&rsquo;t practice Paganism yourself. My background is
Serbian and most Serbians follow the Serbian Orthodox Church, but after
watching Varg&rsquo;s videos, I&rsquo;m conflicted. I agree with a lot of what Varg says
about Christianity, but my father long ago told me to follow the Serbian
Orthodox Church if I were to become religious. I&rsquo;m sure that many people feel
the same way after watching Varg&rsquo;s videos, and your thoughts on it would
greatly help people like me make up their minds.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p><em>redacted</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will sum up my answer to this email in bullet points, then explain what I mean.</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; is not a real thing and has nothing to do with paganism in history.</li>
<li>The most direct cultural link between modern man and antiquity is the orthodox Christian Church.</li>
<li>Truth matters&mdash;&ldquo;Picking&rdquo; a religion on personal preferences is brain-dead and self-refuting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="your-average-pagan">Your Average Pagan</h2>
<p>Many people probably don&rsquo;t know who Varg Vikernes is, but since the email brings him up, I will talk about him as an example of where paganism leads.
Modern &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; is not an authentic tradition handed down over the ages.
It is an attempt of modern disconnected people to recreate or re-engineer a culture, time and place they have absolutely no contact with.
This ultimately makes &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; a modernist Rorschach test where individuals can more-or-less create the religion they want.</p>
<h3 id="paganism-with-modern-goggles">Paganism with modern goggles</h3>
<p>Varg&rsquo;s particular &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; is a kind of scientific euhemerism: he doesn&rsquo;t actually believe in gods in the way an ancient pagan would have, but that the concepts of the gods represent scientific or other knowledge.
(This is where the placenta meme around him comes from after all, when he and his wife related assorted pagan myths and items to the tree-like appearance of a human placenta.)
He has also reduced classical abstract spiritual concepts into hormones and other related things.
In essence, he has created a pseudo-paganism that is compatible with modern materialism.</p>
<p>Varg had cited and recommended works such as Frazer&rsquo;s <em>Golden Bough</em> as influential on his thought which is of a similar vein.
This book was part of a wider movement in the English-speaking rationalist world to rationalize and explain myth.
It goes without saying that I think this all comes from the assumption of modern man that all ancient people underlyingly thought like Neil deGrasse Tyson.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-until-legend-becomes-myth">How long until legend becomes myth?</h3>
<p>More plausible is the viewpoint I&rsquo;ve spoken of in works such as <a href="https://notrelated.xyz/#02.04"><em>Hamlet&rsquo;s Mill</em></a>.
It alleges that <em>one specific</em> prehistoric civilization used myth to transmit scientific knowledge, but being thousands of years out from that civilization, the descendant stories are distorted, partial and can only be related after extensive study.
They allege that &ldquo;Hamlet stories&rdquo; are similar in origin and actually carry astrological information, including the idea of the procession of the equinoxes.</p>
<p>But Varg&rsquo;s quasi-euhemerism makes a much stronger claim, that all our &ldquo;forebears&rdquo; (as he tends to call them) left an entire encyclopedia of scientific knowledge in stories that have remained unblemished and mostly unchanged over thousands or <em>millions</em> of years since the Neanderthals, who he views as the Trve Europeans.</p>
<p>This stronger claim should be absurd on its face, as it assumes that over the millennia, there is little to no addition, subtraction or change of folklore.
The <em>Hamlet&rsquo;s Mill</em> model admits that this does happen, but Varg is dealing with a much longer scale and often makes very specific claims about some myths.
What I think Varg is truly doing when he looks at a pagan myth and sees a placenta, he is seeing statistical noise and fitting that noise to the many possibilities in his head.
(I will also say that this is somewhat the modus operandi of many capital-T &ldquo;Traditionalists&rdquo; in the vein of Evola or Guénon.)</p>
<aside>
This is principally a response to the theories that Varg put forth around 2016-2018 when I would occasionally watch his videos. I'm sure it's very possible that he endorses things very different now, since this "paganism" is not anything concrete.
</aside>
<h2 id="is-christianity-a-departure-from-european-tradition">Is Christianity a departure from European tradition?</h2>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve tried to emphasize <a href="https://notrelated.xyz/#02.02">in some places</a> is the general wrongness of the idea of the cultural &ldquo;quantum leap&rdquo; or &ldquo;discontinuity&rdquo; between Prechristian and Christian Europe.
This is a highly important issue for many putative pagans, because they view the &ldquo;change&rdquo; of Europe over to Christianity as perhaps the start of the now constant and perpetual leftist cultural revolution.</p>
<p>This is the idea, which most people and &ldquo;based&rdquo; pagans have even by osmosis, that the Christianization of Europe was a radical break from history and tradition.</p>
<p>This is true only on the Christian metric: obviously the salvation of Europe is a quantum leap.
However, melodramatic pagans will lament that this is when Europe have up its &ldquo;European&rdquo; soul and adopted a &ldquo;Jewish&rdquo; or &ldquo;desert&rdquo; religion which put the continent on a totally different and out-of-touch cultural direction.</p>
<h3 id="pagan-philosophy-and-christianity">Pagan Philosophy and Christianity</h3>
<p>Christian theology, including Trinitarian theology has direct and undeniable &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; analogues and imitators:
Neoplatonism expresses a kind of theological trinity as well (the One, the Intellect and the Soul), albeit one more similar to Origen&rsquo;s trinity where a hierarchy of the three persons exist.</p>
<p>In the cosmogony of the <em>Poemandres</em>, a Hermetic work, shows a pagan creation myth wherein God creates the world via his <em>Logos</em>, as in the first chapter of St. John&rsquo;s gospel, which also has a trinitarian and monotheistic unity with God (differing from Christianity in its panentheism).</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the linked podcast <a href="https://notrelated.xyz/#02.02">episode above</a>, Stoic philosophy is a component needed to understand the opening of the gospel of John and is part of the philosophical backdrop of early Christian theology.</p>
<p>Medieval esoteric doctrines and alchemy viewed all of nature as trinitarian, possessing body, mind, and spirit (salt, sulfur and mercury), which was related directly to the Triune nature of God.
Even specific mystical sects like Mithraism or the many forms of Gnosticism are tied closely to the development of Christianity.</p>
<p>All of these intellectual strands were intertwined with Christianity since the beginning of the written expression of Christian theology.</p>
<p>A pagan now has to ask himself: if Hermeticism or Mithraism had taken over as a universal religion of Europe, would they loathe it like they loathe Christianity and view it as a radical departure from &ldquo;paganism?&rdquo;
Note that Hermeticism had an alleged Egyptian origin, and Mithraism had a orientalist/Iranic origin.</p>
<p>Note that none of my point here is specifically that Christianity influenced or created these other philosophies or that they influenced (providentially) Christianity.
What is important is that looking at it dispassionately, we cannot deem Christianity as some cultural departure from &ldquo;real&rdquo; European culture without also throwing out this entire philosophical tradition as a whole.</p>
<p>Medieval Christians would often look at Greek Philosophy as another covenant of God established to prepare mankind intellectually for the revelation of the Trinity.
(Note also that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCjX0il3wkc">Dante and others</a> represent Christians who viewed the Roman Empire also as part of a divine plan.)</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Christian religion is non-cultural and thus universal/catholic. There are cultural aspects associated with it, but there&rsquo;s a difference between essence and accidents.
Of those cultural aspects, they are nearly all European, not, as some allege, Hebrew or Jewish.
Most of the New Testament is quite literally an explication of why this religion which accepts the Hebrew Scriptures is markedly non-Jewish and why Jewish practices like circumcision and sacrifice are sacrilegious.</p>
<p>So the view we should get from this is that Christianization was no cultural leap into an alien worldview, but something whose intellectual side happened slowly over centuries and would only be viewed as spiritual, not culturally distinct from its environment.</p>
<h3 id="which-change-is-good">Which change is good?</h3>
<p>Note that even Varg admits that religious interpretation and practice changes with the centuries.
In his interpretation and even in his RPG, MYFAROG (which is really just an expression of his paganism and worldview), characters can have one of two &ldquo;Life Stances&rdquo; or religious inclinations: <em>Seiðr</em> or  <em>Âsatrû</em>.
Seiðr &ldquo;tradition,&rdquo; represents a kind of animism, witchcraft or spell-casting, while Âsatrû represents the worship of pagan gods.
Characters can choose either life stance, but one can only change from Seiðr to Âsatrû, which is a representation of the alleged historical shift in early history from animistic to polytheistic practices.</p>
<p>If we accept this cultural transition as &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; in terms of cultural continuity, on what grounds could we also mark as verboten a shift from polytheism to monotheism?
After all, the pagan philosophy of Plato and Aristotle even from the earliest was monotheistic at its core, and even today, the world&rsquo;s one remaining &ldquo;polytheistic&rdquo; religion, Hinduism only appears so on the surface, but has at its core its own monad and final cause: Brahman.</p>
<h2 id="tradition-vs-inventing-your-own-religion">Tradition vs. Inventing your own religion</h2>
<p>To learn of Christian theology, thus, is to set oneself down a road of millennia of learning with often with no delineation between Christian and Prechristian thought.
By the same token, learning of secular philosophy, even as an atheist might lead you to Christianity, as was the case with me.
There is no obvious discontinuity, either in thought or practice.</p>
<p>But modern day &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; does indeed have such a gap.
To be a &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; does not involve communing with a centuries-old tradition passed down generation-to-generation from antiquity.</p>
<p>It is modern people imagining based on T.V. shows, books and their own creativity what Prechristian Europe was like and then putting on their own imitation of it.
They might see something they dislike in the world, blame it on Christians and then imagine a world without it.
This invariably comes with retrojecting their own modern values and assumptions on the past.</p>
<p>After all, we Christians can sit down with an Orthodox Priest or grow up in a Orthodox household and have a direct, personal contact with a tradition and understand how people who are part of it think and act.
We have no tangible contact with Prechristian European paganism, even out of intellectual interest.
Understanding how Europeans truly thought and acted is an issue of cultural reconstruction and theory.
Traditional folklore and practices are still very much alive, but they are now decked in a Christian garb.
We do celebrate Christmas for Our Lord&rsquo;s birth, but everyone knows that nearly all of the practices of that season of the many nations of Europe predate Christianization.</p>
<h3 id="the-worst-possible-decision">The Worst Possible Decision.</h3>
<p>All this said, the absolute worst self-own possible would be someone who has direct and easy access to the Orthodox Church and abandons it or leaves it for a false &ldquo;religion&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t even exist off of the internet and has no organic connection to reality, like Neo-Paganism.</p>
<p>So my recommendation to the emailer above should be obvious.</p>
<p>Being physically close to the Orthodox Church is a huge asset, but even being able to travel to one occasionally is a massive grace. Everyone should be taking advantage of that as often as possible.</p>
<h3 id="pagan-gurus">Pagan Gurus</h3>
<p>Because it is ungrounded and ahistorical, modern &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; thus naturally exists as a kind of extreme Protestant guru-centered feel-goodery where since there is absolutely no tether to a genuine preserved tradition, a man can make up an unfalsifiable claim about what true &ldquo;Paganism&rdquo; is and sell it as legit.</p>
<p>I mentioned Varg earlier, who has concocted a &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; that consists in claiming that their lore and practice embed scientific information.
He doesn&rsquo;t <em>believe</em> in pagan gods, unless we&rsquo;re talking about belief in a very evasive and meaningless Jordan Peterson kind of way.
If we could actually transport a prehistoric pagan to our day and speak to him, he would probably either be confused or bemused by this very modern worldview, but we can&rsquo;t even do this.</p>
<p>Most pagans are not &ldquo;based&rdquo; like Varg anyway (he lives a minimalist and traditional lifestyle in rural France with an ever-growing family).
Most &ldquo;pagans&rdquo; are leftists who like &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; because they hate God and nature and morality and imagine that pagans were demented sexual perverts like they are.</p>
<h2 id="truth">Truth</h2>
<p>Notice that I had specifically avoided the most important issue: Truth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this because when people are asking to convert to something just because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;based,&rdquo; <em>Truth</em> is unfortunately not necessarily their concern, so I&rsquo;ve first addressed issues that do concern them.</p>
<p>The reality is, thankfully, that truth is the most &ldquo;based&rdquo; thing of all&mdash;And it is entirely cringe to believe in something because it sounds cool to you.
If you think you can decide your own truth, you are no different from someone who thinks they can decide their own pronouns, literally.</p>
<p>Even in the email above, he refers to me &ldquo;choosing&rdquo; orthodox Christianity as if it were an issue of personal taste.
If I liked pop music and people rolling on the ground, perhaps I would be just as justified converting to some Pentecostal sect.
This is silly.</p>
<p>The greatest deception is that religion is this separate category about &ldquo;feelings&rdquo; or &ldquo;preference&rdquo; and not truth.
Atheist and spiritual R*dditor Stephen Jay Gould put this in words in the modern era, calling science and religion &ldquo;non-overlapping magesteria,&rdquo; declaring in a laughable attempt at big-braned centrism that nothing in material reality is relevant to religion and nothing in religion is relevant to material reality.</p>
<p>This is strange because people can research the philosophies I mentioned earlier, Platonism, Gnosticism, Stoicism, Hermeticism and can analyze and critique them and look at them as models of reality perfectly comparable to modern philosophical assumptions and approaches.
But we have been taught to view Christianity as this separate category, that can&rsquo;t possibly be a model of reality, but is a something merely &ldquo;moral&rdquo; or &ldquo;personal&rdquo; or &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; which are all terms that have been debased to mean nothing at all.</p>
<p>A Christian believes that Jesus&rsquo;s resurrection was a true historical event, and a prelude of a general resurrection to come and that he established a Church and sacraments which are his vehicles for having man recover from sin within this life to prepare for his roles in the next.
The orthodox Christian Church is an unbroken chain since that period, and oft built on yet older philosophical and liturgical practices.</p>
<p>If you find this alien or God unbelieveable, you can do yourself the favor of prayer and visit a priest and see what happens.</p>
<h3 id="they-dont-even-believe-it">They don&rsquo;t even believe it.</h3>
<p>To contrast, pagans do not believe in pagan gods. Their brains are 100% modern and materialistic in mindset, and if they ironically say they believe in gods, it is out of some kind of Petersonian fake metaphorical &ldquo;belief&rdquo; in a concept or that &ldquo;Zeus&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a person, but is some kind of abstraction symbolizing the weather or something silly.
The only thing sillier is for them to claim that people in the ancient world <em>didn&rsquo;t really believe in them either</em>, but practiced entire religions meta-ironically for some social reasons.
If they believe in a &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; nature, it is not one beyond or above matter, but instead derived from it: it is psychological, hormonal, etc.</p>
<p>Modern paganism is neither a tradition, nor a religion, nor even a belief.
It is just a new identity which supposedly flexes some kind of disposition to the world which is not even consistent across pagans because there is no basis for any of it.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="real-baste-european-pagans">Real Baste European Pagans</h3>
<p>Christians, however, do believe in pagan gods.
Christians have always admitted the reality of spiritual beings, including the demonic.
You can take the Michael Heiser/Divine Council pill on this if you&rsquo;re interested:
While there is only one Creator and Supreme God, he created many among his heavenly host, and originally appointed them to the different races on earth.
Many rebelled and set themselves up as specific gods of their appointed races.</p>
<p>One of the purposes of Christ&rsquo;s coming was to vanquish these usurpers, and thus paganism/polytheism, which obviously has been successful.
(Note that the <a href="https://lindypress.net/book?pk=6">Book of Enoch</a> in Chapter 10 prophecies that these fallen angels would be judged 70 generations after the Enochian period, which cross-referencing with the Gospel of Luke, it is exactly 70 generations until Christ.)
Now the issues of faith are not so much polytheism, but heresy and then atheism, which is a significant enough change in the cosmic dynamic.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-07-29T11:53:20+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/christianity-based-paganism/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/christianity-based-paganism/</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Minimizing Liabilities Is Making It.]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>The default way to look at financial &ldquo;independence&rdquo; nowadays is to think that means &ldquo;making a lot of money.&rdquo;
That&rsquo;s understandable.</p>
<p>But then you see stuff like this:</p>

<figure class="titleimg"><img alt="60% of millennials earning over $100,000 say they're living paycheck to paycheck." src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/millennial-paycheck.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Or this:</p>

<figure class="title"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/net-worth.jpg" /><figcaption>It takes until 30 for a person to be as rich as they were when they were born. (And this is average net worth, median would be significantly worse.)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The longer you mentally analyze the second picture, the more depressing it will get. Obviously the negative net worth early in life is kids losing around $10,000 a year in value by going to college, but the truly depressing thing is that after that period, their net worth increases only by an average of about $5,000 a year.</p>
<p>That means they might have $5,000 more in the bank or $5,000 paid off of their student loans or $5,000 going to equity in a house, but no combination greater than that.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-this-happen">How does this happen?</h2>
<p>How is it that people alive in the period of the highest and most productive technology are working more than Medieval serfs?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it in simple terms by defining &ldquo;making it:&rdquo;</p>
<dl>
<dt>Making it:</dt>
<dd>Earning or having significantly more money than you spend or owe.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Or in pseudomath:</p>
<p><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">income - liabilities = comfortability</math></p>
<p>To increase comfortablity, you can increase your income or decrease your liabilities.
This is a simple equation.</p>
<p>By &ldquo;liabilities&rdquo; I mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>the cost of food you have to eat to live</li>
<li>the cost of the place you need to live</li>
<li>the payments for goods and services you actually need (power, or perhaps a car, etc.)</li>
<li>debts</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>problem</em> I would estimate is that people focus <strong>all of their time, money and interest on increasing their income and focus quite literally none on <em>decreasing</em> their liabilities</strong>, which is actually substantially easier anyway.</p>
<p>In fact, the modern economy, including all the bad advice it gives to people can generally be thought of a system that is desperatly trying to <em>increase</em> everyone&rsquo;s liabilities within it.
Financial libabilities, debt and others, breed even more financial liabilities.</p>
<h3 id="the-lifestory-of-basically-everyone-nowadays">The Lifestory of Basically Everyone Nowadays</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s illustrate this with the story of most people you know:</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the best college I can because everyone told me to.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I need to pay off my $40,000+ in student loans, so I need to move to the city and get a good job.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I get paid well, so I need a better car and other stuff to match.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I still have loan debt, car debt and now credit card debt, but now I have a good credit score, so I&rsquo;ll use all my savings to pay 20% of an expensive house I&rsquo;ll be paying off for 25 years.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Oh my boss wants me to humiliate myself for sodomy month or get the Coofid vaccine or the Mark of the Beast to keep my job. I have at least a quarter of a mil invested in my life here, so I can&rsquo;t just leave. Be realistic.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Yeah the economy is really bad and I lost a lot of investments. Either way, this is my career and what I&rsquo;m trained for. It&rsquo;d be hard to retrain. I made the right choices, I just got unlucky.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m 60 and it&rsquo;s time for retirement! Now that my body is broken I can start enjoying life!&rdquo;</li>
<li><em>*Dies of seed-oil-induced heart attack.*</em></li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;d be wrong to singularly blame student loans for all of this, but there is a tangible sense in which opening up any new massive monthly liability to the system encourages people to open up more to cover for it.</p>
<p>No one is ever told that this is the inevitable end of increasing liabilities: you need more and more liabilities.</p>
<h3 id="which-way-millennial">&ldquo;Which way Millennial?&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Millennials come in two financial categories: around 90% of them are extreme consoomers who cannot not spend every penny of their salaries on subscriptions, plastic toys and coffee and seem to view the fact they get calls from collections agencies as some unpreventable outcome of &ldquo;capitalism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other 10% are the exact opposite: they are contemplating living in the trunk of their 1990&rsquo;s Corolla parked in the parking lot of their job site so they can save 97% of their income.
When they plan on buying a house or getting married, they are quixotically salivating on how much money they can save on monthly bills.</p>
<h2 id="the-endgame">The Endgame</h2>
<p>I will go ahead and say, I consider the ideal not even to be rich, but to not need money to live a comfortable life because you have put yourself in a geographic and behavioral position where you can survive on as little as possible.</p>
<p>Either way, my mindset (as the second type of millennial) has always been &ldquo;How can I absolutely minimize the amount of money I need to live?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;What is the cheapest place to rent?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What is the cheapest-per-calorie real food for me to eat?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What &ldquo;needs&rdquo; are not really needs and can I go without?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>The implicit goal was to live on as little as possible: that&rsquo;s what actually maximizes your life&rsquo;s freedom.
If you can live on less than, say, $500 a month, even working as a part-time wagie, you will be plenty to pay bills, save a significant amount and have lots of free time.</p>
<p>For young single guys in computer science, this is especially ideal, since your hobbey/craft doesn&rsquo;t cost anything to tinker with.</p>
<p>In my late twenties, right before I bought my house, I was living in a college town with a monthly budget <strong>including my rent</strong> of around $400 ($300 was rent $100 was basically groceries). Probably went over that $100 most months, but never by much. This is also when I started <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/making-free-money-off-credit-cards">churning credit cards</a> to make a significant portion of my little expenditure back.</p>
<h2 id="behavioral-patterns-over-life">Behavioral Patterns over Life</h2>
<p>As you&rsquo;re saving money to buy/pay off a permanent dwelling place, most important is cultivating permanent behaviors that will reduce your need for money and &ldquo;the system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you take the &ldquo;high&rdquo;-income, high-liability route, you&rsquo;re going to be establishing wasteful antipatterns your early life and when you need to buckle down and root those out, it will be more difficult because it will be the egotistically trying task of going from showly and &ldquo;easy&rdquo; pleasure spending to a Spartan budget.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to have a solid foundation of low spending. I said in that video years ago on getting Trumpbux that all money you earn and spend should be directly weaponized to decrease your reliance on money. Property, tools, plants, skills. These are investments much more substantial than investing in boomer stocks because they lessen your need for money.</p>
<h3 id="worst-case-scenario">Worst Case Scenario</h3>
<p>As a passing remark, I&rsquo;ll add that the other benefit of focusing on minimizing liabilities is that it makes you significantly less reliant on &ldquo;the system&rdquo; and more robust in the case of disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Training&rdquo; to get a highly specific corporate job is not going to help you in all possible scenarios in the way that simple the simple craftsmanship of someone who fixes their own cars and things.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2022-07-16T16:10:08+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/minimizing-liabilities-is-making-it/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/minimizing-liabilities-is-making-it/</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[The hardest technical solutions are right in front of your face.]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Nassim Taleb had this old anecdote of the sheer absurdity that while the suitcase and other bags had existed for lifetimes, it was only in the 1990&rsquo;s that people had the idea to put wheels on the things so they didn&rsquo;t have to haul them around airports all day with their strength.</p>
<p>It reminds you of the fact that while children in the Incan Empire did indeed have some toys with wheels, apparently no one thought to use the wheel to make a simple cart or wagon to use in town or on the Inca&rsquo;s extensive imperial roadways.</p>
<p>The proper response to hearing this should be the deserved angst that right now, there are make &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; technological improvements we could make to improve our lives significantly.
Even worse, in lieu of these simple and obvious solutions which have lain hidden in plain site for centuries, we have no doubt developed a lot of inefficient technology to fill in the gap.</p>
<p>Since I was recently doing <a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/w/oz4VV8SrnTEACCndxMASZH">tutorials on Hugo</a>, a static site generator, it&rsquo;s funny to think that through the 90&rsquo;s, no one really thought to invent a computationally simple static-site generator as they exist now.
People moved pretty much directly from manually edditing HTML files manually into massive proprietary WYSIWYG editors and web &ldquo;frameworks&rdquo; that regenerate web pages on every single visit.</p>
<p>This lack of vision and inability to see the simpler solution has largely produced the slow-loading, content-minimal web of today and the bizarre culture of modern &ldquo;webdevs&rdquo; whose diets consist in anti-patterns.</p>
<h2 id="the-shame-of-bitcoin">The shame of Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Recently there was <a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/w/7PZGdoF7WdpWVS1UDcwDFz">an interview released of me</a> at Monerotopia with the Crypto Vigilate team.
Unfortunately, the video cut off and doesn&rsquo;t have perhaps the best part which I now remember: our discussion on the possibility of &ldquo;obvious solutions&rdquo; that could conceivably replace proof-of-work in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, ultimately is a self-reinforcing behavioral Nash Equilibrium that uses the logic of proof-of-work mining to establish consensus while still remaining decentralized.
The thing is, anyone who is not a delusional fanboy has to look at proof-of-work as some kind of incredible weird and inefficient abomination.</p>
<p>To establish decentralized consensus, we have to have an increasing farm of the world&rsquo;s computers performing computations that do essentially nothing outside of &ldquo;secure the network.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no magic force in the universe that has ordained that the only possible way to establish decentralized consensus is Proof-of-Work.
Proof-of-stake is obviously an alternative to it, but one whose long-term game theoretic nature is still an issue of significant controversy.</p>
<p>Regardless, an alien civilization observing us might view the issue of decentralized consensus similar to how we view the Inca who never thought to use wheels to make carts.
It will be pretty absurd if most of the world&rsquo;s computing power will soon be dedicated to proof-of-work mining only for some bratty kid or jaded cryptographer to come up with an &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; other way to establish a self-reinforcing system that can verify decentralized consensus that doesn&rsquo;t require the waste.</p>
<h2 id="take-aways">Take-aways</h2>

<li>Technological opportunities are not just everywhere, they are right in front of your face.</li>
<li>The fact that a solution is obvious and simple is not reason for ruling it out because &ldquo;Someone must have thought of that and tried it before.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Never be happy with technology that is inelegant just because there is no obvious alternative now.</li>

Some of us recall that twenty-one years ago, the most popular code hosting site, a fully Free and Open Source (FOSS)  site called SourceForge, proprietarized all their code — never to make it FOSS again.  Major FOSS projects slowly left  SourceForge since it was now, itself, a proprietary system, and antithetical to FOSS.  FOSS communities learned that it was a mistake to allow a for-profit, proprietary  software company to become the dominant FOSS collaborative development site.  SourceForge slowly collapsed after the DotCom crash,  and today, SourceForge is more advertising link-bait than it is code hosting. We learned a valuable lesson that was a bit too easy to forget — especially when corporate involvement manipulates   FOSS communities to its own ends.  We now must learn the SourceForge lesson again with Microsoft's GitHub.]]</description><pubDate>2022-07-01T08:20:21.312300+00:00</pubDate><link>https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/jun/30/give-up-github-launch/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/jun/30/give-up-github-launch/</guid>

It was almost exactly a year after I had started working on my compiler project (I hope to write a longer post about that someday soon), and in my frustration with the state of affairs with Ruby parsers available to a humble C/C++ programmer, I decided to see how hard it would be.]]</description><pubDate>2022-06-07T09:21:34+00:00</pubDate><link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/i-built-a-ruby-parser/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mpov.timmorgan.org/i-built-a-ruby-parser/</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[My Phone Is Anonymous Now]]</title><description>![CDATA[I needed to anonymize my phone. This how I did it. 
Support independent research and analysis by joining my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone 

I can’t trust anyone with my data. When I use a phone with a Google Account or Apple ID, these companies are by default going to be collect unique hardware identifiers, my location information and app usage data without possibility to opt out. 

If I want to use a phone I need to choose one that is going to allow me to use it completely anonymously and let me be in control of all of my data. I want to a phone that maintains Android’s security model and keeps the best security practices for security updates.

GrapheneOS has a far-reaching number of substantial improvements that altogether make up for the most secure mobile operating system for the end user. 

Because I want to keep this device as anonymous as possible, I do not even insert a SIM card at all and use the phone as a WiFi-only device. To protect my IP address, I use Orbot to route my traffic through Tor.

<item><title>![CDATA[The Splinternet | This Is How The Internet Dies]]</title><description>![CDATA[Support independent research and analysis by joining my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone 

Many academics are sounding alarms that the death of the unified global Internet is already happening. More and more countries are voicing their desire for digital sovereignty and techno-isolationism. 

Experts are worried this cyber-balkanization is creating a multi-verse of national Internets and corporate walled gardens that they refer to as the Splintertnet.

If Internet can be understood as a worldwide network of all networks, Splinternet would be the opposite of that. It is when nations stop participating in the ICANN consensus and begin assigning their own IP addresses. It is also when governments setup nationwide firewalls to restrict free flow of information to and from the country. Both of these trends are already well on their way to create the world’s first Splinternet.

<item><title>![CDATA[A city in crisis: How fentanyl devastated San Francisco - BBC Newsnight]]</title><description>![CDATA[More people died of drug overdoses than of Covid in San Francisco over a one year period. Why has one of the richest cities in the world been devastated by drugs? Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog

Fentanyl is 100 times stronger than morphine and even a tiny quantity can kill. But its low cost has made it a popular recreational drug.

Parts of the city were placed into a state of emergency in December to crackdown on overdose deaths.

And after defunding the police, the city’s mayor has now refunded the police to tackle the issue.

But the democratic mayor and democratic District Attorney are divided on how to fix the problem.

James Clayton reports for Our World and Newsnight.

Regardless, the 1960's saw a resurgence in Populational Control thinking and the "Zero Population Growth" movement, based in the popular work <dfn>The Population Bomb</dfn> by Paul Ehrlich, but also disputed by the optimistic Julian Simon.</p><p>Still, one of the more novel issues is that of Behavioral Sinks in modern societies: Industrial economies that are so well off that they population ceases wanting to reproduce or continue normal human life.

While more and more kids aspire to become famous on the Internet, it's probably relevant to take a look at why more and more youtubers are choosing to leave their channels behind and quit YouTube. It's tempting to watch the big players and fantasize about how great it must be to be in their shoes, or to adopt the hustle mentality and quickly work your way into burnout, but sometimes it's good to listen to the stories of those who've been there and walked away, to understand that life is about a whole lot more than "the grind".

In this video, he talks about some childhood memories while living in Philadelphia in the 1860s.  It was filmed on June 21, 1932.  This video has been colorized, speed-adjusted and restored with audio enhancements for clarity.
Note: Thomson meant to say "75 years ago" rather than "65 years ago" in the beginning.  His family shipped over to America in 1857.

Elihu Thomson was born March 29, 1853, in Manchester, England. His father,
who worked as a mill mechanic, was thrown out of work in 1857 and decided to
emigrate to the United States. In 1858 the family settled in Philadelphia,
where Elihu grew up. His father's work as a mechanic stimulated Thomson's
interest in mechanical and chemical processes. From his early teens he read
widely, built models, and conducted simple chemical experiments. At
Philadelphia's Central High School Thomson was an outstanding student who
attracted the interest of his instructors. Upon graduating in 1870 he was
offered a teaching position at the school.

Between 1870 and 1880 Thomson taught high school in Philadelphia. At the same
time he and a fellow teacher named Edwin J. Houston experimented with
electricity and succeeded in building a practical electric arc lighting
system. In 1879 a group of New England businessmen took an interest in
the Thomson-Houston arc lighting system and offered to finance its fabrication.
In 1880 Thomson moved to New Britain, Connecticut, as the company's chief
engineer. By 1881 Thomson had designed the best arc lighting system in the

<item><title>![CDATA[The Economy Is Fake, the Jobs Are Fake, the Money Is Fake]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>You can't roast people too badly for being "antiwork" when most jobs are simply useless nowadays. Surveys have shown that around half of people report either their job is totally useless, or that it's unclear to them if there is any social benefit to their work whatsoever. How has this happened? Why do people put so much effort into what is, in effect, play work.</p><p>We talk about David Graeber's article, book and concept of <dfn>Bullshit Jobs</dfn>, jobs so inane that even the people working them can't justify their existence. This brings up economic questions of hyper-production, the Consoomerist economy, post-scarcity and of course the alleged panacea of Universal Basic Income (UBI).</p><p>At the root of all of it is a public-private plastic economy based on easy and highly inflationary money, which strips people of savings and keeps people working like good wagies from cradle to the grade on jobs that exist just to keep the fake economy going. Comments on the psychological effects of Bitcoin and hard money included.</p><details>📚 See readings and other media.<p><em>Note that pay-walled academic articles may be obtained by feeding their URLs to sites like Sci-Hub.</em></p><ul><li><a href="https://odysee.com/Antiwork_mod_lol:f">Very funny Antiwork R*dditor appears on Fox News</a></li><li><a href="https://www.strike.coop/bullshit-jobs/">The original Bullshit jobs article</a></li><li><a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/why-its-bad-to-have-high-gdp">"Why It's Bad to Have High GDP"</a></li></ul></details><h1>Timecodes</h1><pre>00:00:00	The Fake Economy

About 35% of palladium, a rare metal also used for semiconductors, is sourced from Russia.

<item><title>![CDATA[Military Documents about Gain of Function contradict Fauci testimony under oath #ExposeFauci]]</title><description>![CDATA[TWEET THIS VIDEO RIGHT NOW: https://ctt.ac/TYeIu

• Military documents state that EcoHealth Alliance approached DARPA in March 2018 seeking funding to conduct gain of function research of bat borne coronaviruses. The proposal, named Project Defuse, was rejected by DARPA over safety concerns and the notion that it violates the gain of function research moratorium.

• The main report regarding the EcoHealth Alliance proposal leaked on the internet a couple of months ago, it has remained unverified until now. Project Veritas has obtained a separate report to the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, written by U.S. Marine Corp Major, Joseph Murphy, a former DARPA Fellow.

• “The proposal does not mention or assess potential risks of Gain of Function (GoF) research,” a direct quote from the DARPA rejection letter.
• Project Veritas reached out to DARPA for comment regarding the hidden documents and spoke with the Chief of Communications, Jared Adams, who said, “It doesn’t sound normal to me,” when asked about the way the documents were buried.

[WASHINGTON, D.C. – Jan. 10, 2022] Project Veritas has obtained startling never-before-seen documents regarding the origins of COVID-19, gain of function research, vaccines, potential treatments which have been suppressed, and the government’s effort to conceal all of this.

The documents in question stem from a report at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, better known as DARPA, which were hidden in a top secret shared drive.
 
DARPA is an agency under the U.S. Department of Defense in charge of facilitating research in technology with potential military applications.
 
Project Veritas has obtained a separate report to the Inspector General of the Department of Defense written by U.S. Marine Corp Major, Joseph Murphy, a former DARPA Fellow.

The report states that EcoHealth Alliance approached DARPA in March 2018, seeking funding to conduct gain of function research of bat borne coronaviruses. The proposal, named Project Defuse, was rejected by DARPA over safety concerns and the notion that it violates the basis gain of function research moratorium.
 
According to the documents, NIAID, under the direction of Dr. Fauci, went ahead with the research in Wuhan, China and at several sites across the U.S.
 
Dr. Fauci has repeatedly maintained, under oath, that the NIH and NIAID have not been involved in gain of function research with the EcoHealth Alliance program. But according to the documents obtained by Project Veritas which outline why EcoHealth Alliance’s proposal was rejected, DARPA certainly classified the research as gain of function. 

“The proposal does not mention or assess potential risks of Gain of Function (GoF) research,” a direct quote from the DARPA rejection letter.

Major Murphy’s report goes on to detail great concern over the COVID-19 gain of function program, the concealment of documents, the suppression of potential curatives, like Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine, and the mRNA vaccines.
 
Project Veritas reached out to DARPA for comment regarding the hidden documents and spoke with the Chief of Communications, Jared Adams, who said, “It doesn’t sound normal to me,” when asked about the way the documents were shrouded in secrecy. “If something resides in a classified setting, then it should be appropriately marked,” Adams said. “I’m not at all familiar with unmarked documents that reside in a classified space, no.”

In a video breaking this story published on Monday night, Project Veritas CEO, James O’Keefe, asked a foundational question to DARPA:

“Who at DARPA made the decision to bury the original report? They could have raised red flags to the Pentagon, the White House, or Congress, which may have prevented this entire pandemic that has led to the deaths of 5.4 million people worldwide and caused much pain and suffering to many millions more.”

Dr. Anthony Fauci has not yet responded to a request for comment on this story.
