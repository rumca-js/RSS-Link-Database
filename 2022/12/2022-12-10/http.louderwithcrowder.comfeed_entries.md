Worst than the Queen dying or Russia invading Ukraine. To discover that when Liver talked about the nine ancestral tenants he left out the tenth one about knowing a guy who got the hookup... I don't know about you, but I didn't know what to believe in anymore. However, I'm happy to announce that Liver has promised he is going "natty" and will stop roiding up.</p><p>Leave it to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tiktok-andrew-schulz-app" target="_blank">Andrew Schulz</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/apu-akaash-singh" target="_blank">Akaash Singh</a> to get the scoop.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="instagram-media"><div style="padding: 16px;"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cl9GMFWpB5b/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;" target="_blank"> <div style="display: flex;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"></div> <div style="display: flex;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;"></div></div></div><div style="padding: 19% 0;"></div> <div style="display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;"></div><div style="padding-top: 8px;"> <div style="color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style="padding: 12.5% 0;"></div> <div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;"><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div style="margin-left: 8px;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;"></div> <div></div></div><div style="margin-left: auto;"> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;"></div></div></a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cl9GMFWpB5b/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">A post shared by Liver King (@liverking)</a><br /></div></blockquote> </div><p>Not everyone was fooled by Liver.

## Elon Musk responds to Elton John's overdramatic departure from Twitter with a question I don't think Sir Elton can answer

No one was more heartbroken by the news than Elon Musk who, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-twitter-candidates" target="_blank">while busy exposing everything about Twitter we assumed was true</a>, took the time to reach out to the retiring celebrity.</p><p>Elton <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elton-john-twitter" target="_blank">announced his departure from Twitter</a> on Twitter. Everyone knows you are unable to delete your account without <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jim-carrey-leaves-twitter" target="_blank">making a sweeping declaration</a> about deleting your account. We don't need the Twitter Files to expose that. It's been in Twitter's terms of service since as far back as 2018.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">All my life I‚Äôve tried to use music to bring people together. Yet it saddens me to see how misinformation is now being used to divide our world.<br /> <br />I‚Äôve decided to no longer use Twitter, given their recent change in policy which will allow misinformation to flourish unchecked.<br />‚Äî Elton John (@eltonofficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/eltonofficial/status/1601200277276659712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Elon Musk was crushed that this legend (who only followed twenty people) would no longer be tweeting. Elon's go-to karaoke song is "Can You Feel the Love Tonight?" He was just told by Sir Elton himself... no. Elon hoped Elton would come back. Though he did have one question: "Is there any misinformation in particular that you‚Äôre concerned about?"</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I love your music. Hope you come back. Is there any misinformation in particular that you‚Äôre concerned about?<br />‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1601275664098725891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>I'll bet you my scratchy copy of <em>Madman Across the Water</em> that Elton won't be able to answer that question. The talking points his PR team was no doubt sent by a shadow dark money progressive activist group didn't give specifics. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/legal-influencer-tiktok" target="_blank">And they hate it when you ask questions</a>. Team Elton was told to just say "misinformation." I would be surprised if Elton even knows he tweeted that yesterday.</p><p>For the time being, no more Elton John on the bird app. I'm sure the bitch will be back, though. Just like all the Twitter advertisers.</p><p><p>

## 'Wah wah censorship': Twitter execs mocks conservatives while favoring pro-Biden 'misinformation'

Make sure to check out all the times the feds got cozy with Twitter executives. I wanted to focus on a few tweets in the middle that expose the type of people who were tasked with throttling tweets, surfacing tweets, and deciding what was "misinformation" or not. Spoiler: they were all bitterly partisan <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-engineer-free-speech" target="_blank">commie as f*ck</a> activists.</p><p>Ones who would routinely mock conservatives that were targeted.

I get the focus on the Trump stuff. The historic precedence of deplatforming a SITTING WORLD LEADER speaks for itself.</p><p>What I'm more interested in is the "what we say, goes" aspect of Twitter during the first two years of the Biden administration. Where every thought that the White House disagreed with was labeled varying shades of "misinformation." That's all coming soon, I'm sure. I'm just impatient.</p><p><p>
