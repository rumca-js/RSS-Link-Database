With co-op gaming bigger and better than ever, we've had a look at the best social games to play in 2022, thanks to the data provided by GameSpot's sister site Metacritic.</p><p dir="ltr">The best examples of online and local co-op for 2022 represent a fascinating spread of genres and ideas. From our list, we can see that Elden Ring's helpful summoning system has placed it at the top of the charts for a reason; Destiny 2: The Witch Queen is a fun and flexible space adventure where teamwork does indeed make the dream work; and Victoria 3 is deeper than the Marianas Trench with its socio-political worldbuilding.</p><p>There were plenty of other great co-op games available this year, and for nostalgic fans, the chance to explore Atari at the height of its power or test out some shinobi skills in a brand-new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game was a cherry on top of a retro sundae. You can see all the games that made the cut below, and for more Metacritic lists, check out GameSpot's roundups of the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-xbox-games-of-2022-according-to-metacritic/2900-4479/"> best Xbox</a>,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-playstation-games-of-2022-according-to-metacritic/2900-4478/"> PlayStation</a>, and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-pc-games-of-2022-according-to-metacritic/2900-4484/"> PC games</a> of 2022.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Elden Ring</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4074332-eldenring%283%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Misery loves company, and in Elden Ring, the dark fantasy becomes even more fascinating when a fellow Tarnished joins you for some shenanigans in a forgotten realm. The catch here is that summoning some friends to assist you also opens up the portals for invaders to sneak in, leading to some of the most intense moments of the game, but the tension is worth it when you've got a friendly sword at your side to help you through some of Elden Ring's tougher battles.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/elden-ring">Metascore: 96</a> | Read our<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-review-death-of-the-wild/1900-6417832/"> Elden Ring review</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/elden-ring-xbox-one-xbox-series-x/6352382.p?skuId=6352382&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=The Best Co-Op Games Of 2022 According To Metacritic&amp;article_url=http://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-co-op-games-of-2022-according-to-metacritic/2900-4515/&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4074333-cupheadthedeliciouslastcourse%282%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Local co-op is at its best in Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course, the meaty expansion to the original Cuphead game. With Ms. Chalice thrown into the mix, new skills to master, and some of the best boss fights to ever grace a TV screen, The Delicious Last Course doesn't hold anything back when it starts serving a white-knuckle ride of fun.

Doing just that with a friend by your side, or if you're planning a party, assembling an entire quartet of pizza-chomping ninja turtles to help save the day. With the aesthetic of an authentic arcade classic, this pixel-perfect rebirth of TMNT's golden age offers some chaotic co-op fun that's hard to beat.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge">Metascore: 87</a> | Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge-review-turtle-power/1900-6417895/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge review</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge-nintendo-switch/6510132.p?skuId=6510132&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=The Best Co-Op Games Of 2022 According To Metacritic&amp;article_url=http://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-co-op-games-of-2022-according-to-metacritic/2900-4515/&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4074335-monsterhunterrisesunbreak.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">With both online and local co-op on offer, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak shares the thrill of the hunt and the fun in chasing down legendary beasts.

By taking notes--or copying your fellow player's homework--players can work together and grow their kingdoms into feudal powerhouses who have each other's back. At least that's the plan most of the time, as you never know when a game will switch from cooperative to competitive in this medieval masterpiece.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/crusader-kings-iii">Metascore: 85</a> | Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/crusader-kings-3-review-pass-the-duchy/1900-6417551/">Crusader Kings 3 review</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/crusader-kings-3-xbox-series-x/6481242.p?skuId=6481242&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=The Best Co-Op Games Of 2022 According To Metacritic&amp;article_url=http://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-co-op-games-of-2022-according-to-metacritic/2900-4515/&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Total War: Warhammer 3</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4074338-totalwarwarhammer3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Imagine the chaos of Warhammer's grim fantasy realm playing out across cooperative campaigns and head-to-head battles to see who has the best brain for strategy. That's Total War: Warhammer 3. The latest entry in the series adds some novel twists to the usual co-op formula as you fling thousands of troops into battle; and with diplomacy playing a vital role in how the story expands, it's a fascinating look at forging alliances, betraying factions, and generally having a knife aimed at someone's back in this epic strategy game.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/total-war-warhammer-iii">Metascore: 85</a> | Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/total-war-warhammer-3-review-bed-of-chaos/1900-6417839/">Total War: Warhammer 3 review</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/total-war-warhammer-iii/9nggb0gzpb9d">See on Xbox Store</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4074339-forza5hhw.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">With online co-op support for up to six players, Forza Horizon 5's Hot Wheels expansion becomes a joyous sandbox of childhood nostalgia when you take the colorful matchbox cars out onto a track that laughs in the face of danger. It's all the technical polish of Forza Horizon 5 viewed through a toyetic lens, and nothing's better than defying gravity in an expansion which taps into imagination and high-speed thrills to deliver an exhilarating racing experience.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/forza-horizon-5-hot-wheels">Metascore: 85</a> | Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/forza-horizon-5-hot-wheels-review-paradise-city/1900-6417922/">Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels review</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/forza-horizon-5-hot-wheels/9pnsz7gmwcqz">See on Xbox Store</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4074340-kirbyandtheforgottenland.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Kirby's latest adventure on the Switch is a charming showcase of pink blob fun, but if you're looking to expand on the gluttonous adventurer's escapades, then grab a friend. A co-op partner can take control of Bandana Waddle Dee, letting them use the little warrior's spear to help even the odds for Kirby. It's nothing revolutionary, but this co-op mode does help share the splendid fun of one of the best Switch games of the year.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Metascore: 85</a> | Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review-the-best-kirby-yet/1900-6417850/">Kirby and the Forgotten Land review</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch/6483496.p?skuId=6483496&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=The Best Co-Op Games Of 2022 According To Metacritic&amp;article_url=http://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-co-op-games-of-2022-according-to-metacritic/2900-4515/&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Nobody Saves the World</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4074341-nobodysavestheworld.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">From the team behind Guacamelee, Nobody Saves The World is a crisp and sharp dungeon-crawling adventure where the key hook is the power to shape-shift into more powerful forms. On its own, that's a great gameplay loop to get engaged in, but the real magic happens when you recruit a friend to join you in those dangerous dungeons. With each form having its own particular quirks and abilities, there's a synergy at play here that makes each excursion a chaotic but fun experience packed full of experimental energy.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/nobody-saves-the-world">Metascore: 84</a> | Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nobody-saves-the-world-review-creature-comforts/1900-6417812/">Nobody Saves the World review</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/nobody-saves-the-world/9nfz65kkj10x">See on Xbox Store</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Prodeus</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4074343-prodeus.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">A first-person shooter with an old soul, Prodeus is a retro-inspired romp that's also a reminder of how two nigh-unstoppable protagonists armed with plasma weapons are better than one. Simply put, co-op in Prodeus is like a Pantera album: a vulgar display of power that looks, feels, and plays brilliantly as you paint space installations red with the pixelated blood of anything that stands in your way.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/prodeus">Metascore: 83</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/prodeus-nintendo-switch/6524756.p?skuId=6524756&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=The Best Co-Op Games Of 2022 According To Metacritic&amp;article_url=http://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-co-op-games-of-2022-according-to-metacritic/2900-4515/&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Victoria 3</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4074344-victoria3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">An absurdly complex socio-political game in which you run the <em>entire </em>world during one of humanity's most pivotal industrial years might not sound like a ticket to multiplayer fun, but Victoria 3 is the exception to the rule here. If you're willing to put in the work to learn the nuances of this grand strategy title, you'll find a deep sandbox full of possibility and a chance to build an ideal utopia in a simulator that is both elegant and realistic. Doing so online only deepens the experience, leading to a century of activity that you'll seldom want to leave.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/victoria-3">Metascore: 83</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4073704-bestfamilygames.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Family-friendly games are often--and unfairly--labeled as low effort entertainment that only exists so that you don't have to worry about accidentally showing your kids a gruesome Mortal Kombat fatality. In 2022, games of the friendlier variety weren't just fun, but some of the best entertainment of the year and available on a wide variety of platforms. These were games that were designed to appeal to as many people as possible, regularly mixing up high-energy designs with deceptively complex gameplay systems while somehow <em>still </em>being approachable to everyone in the room.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the highlights of the year include Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope, the second ambitious crossover between Ubisoft and Nintendo that could leave you in stitches. Not just absurd fun featuring those rascally rabbids, Sparks of Hope is an amazing tactical game that pushes the genre forward in bold new directions. Tunic was also terrific fun, first rolling out on Xbox and PC and then eventually making its way to other platforms six months later to deliver classic fun with a few modern flourishes. Kirby's move to 3D platforming in Kirby and the Forgotten Land was perhaps the most adorable game of the year, and it also pushed the franchise forward in fun and inventive ways.</p><p dir="ltr">For retro fans, 2022 was a buffet of old school fun that could appeal to the whole family. From classic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action to Atari 50's wonderfully entertaining trip through history, it was a good year to have your nostalgia rekindled. We've rounded up the best of the best below thanks to the numbers provided by GameSpot's sister site Metacritic. For more lists, be sure to check out the best PlayStation, Xbox, and PC games of 2022.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Atari 50</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4073682-atari50%282%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">For those of you who still remember the glory days of Atari, then the recent Atari 50 collection is a treasure trove of games from a groundbreaking era. Simple but challenging, there's a certain joy in not only revisiting games that helped pave the way for the gaming industry of today, but also sharing those experiences with younger and older members of the family. Come for the trip down memory lane, stay for the insightful commentary from legends who helped design these classics.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/atari-50-the-anniversary-celebration">Metascore: 89</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/atari-50-the-anniversary-celebration-playstation-5/6518133.p?skuId=6518133&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=The Best Family Games Of 2022 According To Metacritic&amp;article_url=http://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-family-games-of-2022-according-to-metacritic/2900-4510/&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Rogue Legacy 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4073684-roguelegacy2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Anyone who played Rogue Legacy when it first came out in 2013 knew that this roguelite dungeon crawler from developer Cellar Door Games was going to be something special. Almost a decade later, a sequel to the delightfully colorful game arrived to rekindle those feelings, and while Rogue Legacy 2 doesn't innovate as much as its predecessor, it does improve on its formula with captivating new ideas. Vibrant fun with terrific combat and one of the most satisfying gameplay loops around in its genre, Rogue Legacy 2 is approachable action for the whole family.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/rogue-legacy-2">Metacritic: 88</a> | Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rogue-legacy-2-review-grand-lineage/1900-6417870/">Rogue Legacy 2 review</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1253920/Rogue_Legacy_2/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Tunic</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4073683-tunic%281%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Tunic draws you in with its vibrant world, adorable fox hero, and a landscape that's evocative of The Legend of Zelda, but this is a game that will test your cunning and resolve. Challenging enemies await you as you descend into a more kid-friendly take on Dark Souls essentially, but this is a game where the journey is more rewarding than the destination. Inspired by some of the greatest franchises in gaming, Tunic manages to blaze its own path forward with striking visuals, exhilarating combat, and good old-fashioned exploration. And thanks to its accessibility options, players of all ages and skill levels can explore its strikingly charming world.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/tunic">Metacritic: 86</a> | Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tunic-review-fox-die/1900-6417845/">Tunic review</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/tunic-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-oled-model-nintendo-switch-lite-digital/6523311.p?skuId=6523311&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=The Best Family Games Of 2022 According To Metacritic&amp;article_url=http://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-family-games-of-2022-according-to-metacritic/2900-4510/&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Return to Monkey Island</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4073685-returntomonkeyisland%281%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">If you had a prediction sheet for 2022, there's a good chance that you <em>didn't </em>have "Monkey Island for a new generation'' on your list. While Return to Monkey Island is undeniably a game that has a target-lock on veterans of the series, there's more than enough content here to rope in newcomers as well to the continuing misadventures of Guybrush Threepwood. The bold art direction complements the weird story perfectly, the writing is sharper than the saltiest insult from a sea dog, and with excellent voice acting on tap as well, the series makes a triumphant return that's bound to please anyone playing and watching the game's story unfold.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/return-to-monkey-island">Metacritic: 87</a> | Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/return-to-monkey-island-review-happiness-is-a-warm-manatee/1900-6417961/">Return to Monkey Island review</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/return-to-monkey-island-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-oled-model-nintendo-switch-lite-digital/6523188.p?skuId=6523188&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=The Best Family Games Of 2022 According To Metacritic&amp;article_url=http://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-family-games-of-2022-according-to-metacritic/2900-4510/&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Gran Turismo 7</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4073686-granturismo7.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The future might be electric when it comes to cars, but for now, the siren song of petrol-powered mechanical beasts hitting the track is a tune that anyone of any age can appreciate. It may not have had a completely smooth start out of the gate, but with a few months of patches, tweaks, and new content, Gran Turismo 7 has become pure petrolhead heaven. You might need to be 16 to be allowed to get behind the wheel on your own, but this sophisticated and gorgeous driving simulator won't ask for ID when you get behind its digital wheel.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/gran-turismo-7">Metacritic: 87</a> | Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/gran-turismo-7-review-round-we-go-again/1900-6417837/">Gran Turismo 7 review</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Tinykin</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4073688-tinykin.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">What happens when you toss Pikmin and Honey I Shrunk the Kids into a blender? You get Tinykin, a delightful adventure into the realm of messy, larger than life rooms that also has some Saturday morning 1990s cartoon flair to its visual design. It's that mix of platforming, puzzles, and surprisingly heartfelt storytelling that makes Tinykin worth picking up for anyone in the mood for a playful adventure.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/tinykin">Metacritic: 87</a> | Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tinykin-review-a-charming-collectathon-callback/1900-6417959/">Tinykin review</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1599020/Tinykin/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>OlliOlli World</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4073689-olliolliworld%281%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Roll7's OlliOlli World is pure joy in a colorful world where every skateboarding run is both challenging and cathartic. Previous OlliOlli games felt fantastic to play, but with this third entry in the series adopting a 2.5 art aesthetic, the series pops with both kickflips and personality to dazzling effect. Far more approachable than its predecessors, meditative, and quirky, OlliOlli World makes side-scrolling skateboarding feel better than ever.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/olliolli-world">Metacritic: 87</a> | Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/olliolli-world-review-half-pipe-heaven/1900-6417822/">OlliOlli World review</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/olliolli-xbox-one-digital/5898306.p?skuId=5898306&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=The Best Family Games Of 2022 According To Metacritic&amp;article_url=http://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-family-games-of-2022-according-to-metacritic/2900-4510/&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value">See on Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4073691-mario%2Brabbidssparksofhope.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Just as much fun to watch as it is to play, Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope is clever tactical gameplay wrapped up in delightfully colorful design. The combination of Nintendo's Mushroom Kingdom icons with Ubisoft's raving Rabbids makes for pure comedy gold; the voice acting will have you in stitches; and the accessible gameplay becomes more rewarding the more you experiment with it.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/mario-+-rabbids-sparks-of-hope">Metacritic: 86</a> | Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-review-this-sparks-joy/1900-6417985/">Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope review</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-cosmic-edition-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-oled-model-nintendo-switch-lite/6464074.p?skuId=6464074&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=The Best Family Games Of 2022 According To Metacritic&amp;article_url=http://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-family-games-of-2022-according-to-metacritic/2900-4510/&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value">See on Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Two Point Campus</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4073687-twopointcampus1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Two Point Hospital was heartwarming--darn defibrillators--fun when it first came out, and a few years later, Two Point Campus continues that tradition with a goofy look at academia. It's a game that's focused on shaping the minds of tomorrow, and while dealing with the paperwork to help build the ultimate university might sound boring, it's a surprisingly fun game when you see all your hard work pay off with the creation of a college that runs on mayhem and clever civil engineering.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/two-point-campus">Metacritic: 84</a> | Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/two-point-campus-review-old-school/1900-6417929/">Two Point Campus review</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/two-point-campus-enrollment-launch-edition-nintendo-switch/6497236.p?skuId=6497236&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=The Best Family Games Of 2022 According To Metacritic&amp;article_url=http://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-family-games-of-2022-according-to-metacritic/2900-4510/&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4073690-teenagemutantninjaturtlesshredder%27srevenge1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">No matter how old you are, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a reassuring presence thanks to the franchise's ability to change with the times. Shredder's Revenge is a great example of this, as it pays homage to the days of the Konami arcade games and chucks in several terrific updates to the action-packed formula. But what makes Shredder's Revenge such a great family title is its superb co-op, as you're easily able to fill the screen with the cult-classic ninja turtles, their master Splinter, intrepid reporter, and sports fanatic Casey Jones.

To say anything more would be to spoil what kind of a game Beacon Pines is, but if you're in the mood for a story where consequences are real, the content gets surprisingly emotional, and agonizing over which path to take during a critical juncture, Beacon Pines is one to grab.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/beacon-pines">Metacritic: 85</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1269640/Beacon_Pines/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Shovel Knight Dig</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4073693-shovelknightdig.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">You're never too old to enjoy a Shovel Knight game, and in Shovel Knight Dig, the spade-wielding hero is back and better than ever with more detailed 16-bit designs, tough roguelite elements, and some of the best pixel animation of the year. Developer Yacht Club has become a master of its craft, and with Shovel Knight Dig, that craft is an energetic and skillful odyssey across a fantasy land that shows off some imaginative design.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/shovel-knight-dig">Metacritic: 85</a> | Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shovel-knight-dig-review-ace-of-spades/1900-6417965/">Shovel Knight Dig review</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/shovel-knight-dig-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-oled-model-nintendo-switch-lite-digital/6523359.p?skuId=6523359&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=The Best Family Games Of 2022 According To Metacritic&amp;article_url=http://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-family-games-of-2022-according-to-metacritic/2900-4510/&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4073696-hotwheels.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Take the high-octane racing action of Forza Horizon 5, throw in some Hot Wheels cars that have been sized up, unleash them on orange tracks that'll have you gleefully defying gravity, and you've got a recipe for success right there. The Hot Wheels expansion for Forza Horizon 5 is pure childhood glee, a dream of racing the greatest cars in the world on tracks that speak to your inner child. A silly burst of high-speed fun, nothing compares to the sheer exhilaration of putting the pedal to the metal as you race into a gigantic loop.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/forza-horizon-5-hot-wheels">Metacritic: 85</a> | Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/forza-horizon-5-hot-wheels-review-paradise-city/1900-6417922/">Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels review</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4073694-kirbyforgottenkeyart.0.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">If anyone doubted that Nintendo's adorable pink blob could carry a 3D game all on his lonesome little squishy shoulders, then Kirby and the Forgotten Land is the game that will turn naysayers into true believers. It's the idea of Kirby at its very best, a joyous exploration of a strange land that energizes players with its unbeatable positivity and also gets wonderfully weird when you see Kirby start to devour everything in sight as part of a crucial gameplay mechanic. Pure whimsical action, platforming, and secret-uncovering that'll keep you hooked for hours, Kirby's latest title is a tremendously fun showcase for one of Nintendo's greatest icons. It's also one of the best co-op games on Switch to play with your child.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Metacritic: 85</a> | Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review-the-best-kirby-yet/1900-6417850/">Kirby and the Forgotten Land review</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch/6483496.p?skuId=6483496&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=The Best Family Games Of 2022 According To Metacritic&amp;article_url=http://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-family-games-of-2022-according-to-metacritic/2900-4510/&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Nobody Saves the World</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4073695-nobodysavestheworld1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">When you've got the team behind Guacamelee putting a fresh spin on the apocalypse, you know you're in for a good time. Nobody Saves the World reinforces that idea, as the combination of incredibly crisp graphics, a catchy soundtrack, and gameplay that revolves around a bunch of extremely varied and powerful forms is an absolute blast to play. It's good-natured zany fun that'll regularly put a smile on your face and feels even better with a second player along for the ride to help generate some synergy on your dungeon-crawling escapades.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/nobody-saves-the-world">Metacritic: 84</a> | Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nobody-saves-the-world-review-creature-comforts/1900-6417812/">Nobody Saves the World review</a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1432050/Nobody_Saves_the_World/">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />
