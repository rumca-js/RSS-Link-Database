The food writer was heating milk for mashed potatoes on her TV series Cook, Eat, Repeat when she commented that she liked to heat the milk in a <em>mee-crow-waa-vay</em>, as if it were some kind of obscure yet deeply sophisticated European food gadget. It was a joke, clearly, but some people didn\u2019t understand this and Nigella was forced to explain that she did actually know how microwave was normally pronounced. By the following year, the clip of Nigella saying \u201cmee-crow-waa-vay\u201d had become so popular it was nominated for a Bafta.</p><p>The joke works only because the microwave is generally so undervalued as a kitchen item. It\u2019s hard to think of another household object owned by so many and praised by so few. In 2018, 93% of UK households owned a microwave oven, up from 67% in 1994. Yet when the microwave is spoken of, it is usually in negative terms. We jest of \u201cnuking\u201d or \u201czapping\u201d food, or we talk disparagingly of \u201cmicrowave dinners\u201d, as if the technology\u2019s only real use were heating up ready meals. The American food writer Michael Pollan spoke for many when he protested \u2013 in his book Cooked \u2013 that \u201cthe microwave oven is as antisocial as the cook fire is communal\u201d. In an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/may/25/michael-pollan-family-meal-civilisation\" title=\"\">interview with the Guardian</a> in 2013, Pollan commented that, \u201cnobody wants to get too close to a microwave.

This was the 1950s, she says, when \u201cchildren were not supposed to comment on the things adults were saying. It was called talking back, and you were not allowed to do that. Even as a small child, this seemed unfair to me. In school I would get sent out of the classroom even though the other kids made it clear they wanted to hear what I had to say.

With its lingering shots of her walking the streets in her signature get-up \u2013 Anderson &amp; Sheppard coat, white shirt, jeans, chunky boots \u2013 the series cemented Lebowitz\u2019s status as a style icon and introduced her to a new generation of fans, many of whom now accost her on the street. \u201cThey say: \u2018I came to New York because I thought I\u2019d see you and now I did.\u2019 I say: \u2018Well, of course, because it\u2019s a very small place and I walk around a lot.

It explains how long ago a shepherdess, guarding her sheep, was joined every day by a panda cub. Back in those early days, all pandas were snow white, and possibly the cub believed the sheep were pandas. One day, as the panda cub was gambolling clumsily with the lambs, a leopard attacked it. The shepherdess threw herself in front of the panda, and was killed. The panda cub and his family came in sombre gratitude to the shepherdess\u2019s funeral, and out of respect they covered their arms with black ashes, as was the custom. As the funeral went on, they wept, wiping their eyes with their paws and staining them black. As their weeping grew louder, they covered their ears, so that they would not have to hear their own sobs. The ash never washed off, and therefore they are forever marked with signs of their love and grief, their ongoing fealty to bravery.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/10/stories-with-teeth-how-animal-tales-help-us-understand-humans\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/dec/10/10-of-europes-best-cosy-cabins-for-winter", "title": "10 of Europe\u2019s best cosy cabins for winter", "date_published": "2022-12-10 11:00:01+00:00", "description": "<p>Perfect snow, hot saunas, twinkling stars and the snuggliest blankets.

They also offended her, personally. Standing on stage, she felt obliged to issue a quick public health warning before shooting the scene. \u201cI looked out at all these sweet, young faces staring up at me and said, \u2018Girls: I do not want you to listen to the lyrics of this song.
