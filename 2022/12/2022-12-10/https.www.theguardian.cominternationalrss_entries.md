<p>Everybody would have bet the house on Harry Kane. The England captain had already scored one equaliser from the penalty spot, which had brought him level with Wayne Rooney on 53 goals for his country – the all-time record. Now, after Olivier Giroud had tilted this World Cup thriller back in the direction of France, Kane stood over the spot once more.</p><p>The penalty had been conceded by Theo Hernandez. It was an extraordinary rush of blood from the full-back, who barged into the back of the England substitute Mason Mount as they chased a high ball that was going over both of them. An even bigger one was to come.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/10/england-france-world-cup-quarter-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Our midfield have been really important, and you can lose a player in there with some back-three systems. We feel we’ve got to get pressure on France and try to cut the supply, and we’ll get an extra player further up the pitch. We need men on the pitch. These big nights, you have to stand up, you have to go to the depths to get a result. We’re playing well, we’ve got confidence. This will be a huge test of that but it’s great to be coming into the game feeling the way we do.

Some women hold flowers, others hold the hand of their child as they are executed by the Nazis. Kalman says her favourite image is of her grandmother holding the weight of the world. “Though it didn’t stop her from taking care of everything in the home.

<p>The impressive and wildly popular ChatGPT is the latest instalment in a long-running debate about whether we’re creating machines to help us or replace us</p><p>Those who, like this columnist, spend too much time online will have noticed a kind of feeding frenzy over the past two weeks. The cause has been the release of an interesting chatbot – a software application capable of conducting an online conversation. The particular bot creating the fuss is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT">ChatGPT</a>, a prototype artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that focuses on usability and dialogue and was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI">developed by OpenAI</a>, an AI research laboratory based in San Francisco.</p><p>ChatGPT uses a large language model built via machine-learning methods and is based on OpenAI’s GPT-3 model, which is capable of producing human-like text when given a prompt in natural language. It’s an example of what has come to be called “generative AI”: software that uses machine-learning algorithms to enable machines to generate artificial content – text, images, audio and video content based on its training data – in a way that might persuade a human user into believing that its outputs are “real”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/10/i-wrote-this-column-myself-but-how-long-before-a-chatbot-could-do-it-for-me">Continue reading...</a>

<p>You know how it goes – someone, somewhere, buys the Italian cake, from where it embarks on a long circumnavigation of various friends and family</p><p>A normal Christmas is predicted, and thanks to this the ritual police are now on patrol. I’m not complaining; I include myself among their number. Loading the freezer with sausage rolls for the party I plan to throw on Boxing Day, I enjoy the soothing embrace of order and repetition, the feeling that all is temporarily right with the world. Very little currently gives me more pleasure than the sound of my small niece talking me through her idea of a proper Christmas. “We have beef, not turkey,” she says, in a voice that is straight out of <em>Barchester Towers</em> (I play a supplicant Mrs Proudie to her austere Archdeacon Grantly).</p><p>It’s strange to think both of how little Christmas has changed in my lifetime and how much. In 2022, I struggle to explain to the young ones that as children my brother and I used to be given edible smoking sets by our granny: a chocolate pipe, cigar and cigarettes alluringly arranged on a moulded, plastic tray. The expressions on their faces insist I’m bonkers. Yet there will surely never be a Christmas at the end of which someone isn’t left looking at a hill of strawberry Quality Street; the Brexit deal does not exist that will fix this particular surplus. Some rituals, admittedly, take a while to get established. But thereafter, they cling like ivy. In the 1980s, my family began going out to an Indian restaurant on Christmas Eve, with the result that this day is now unimaginable without poppadoms. Suggest fish and chips, and there will be blood, not tomato ketchup.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/dec/10/how-panettone-pass-the-parcel-became-one-of-my-christmas-traditions">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Living beside the Thames brings great pleasure, and this stunning new house can cope with the threats of flooding</p><p>What could be more romantic than a house on the river with its ever-shifting views of swans, rowing boats and stately barges? But with water comes the chance of flooding. Which is why Elizabeth Rose decided to take pre-emptive action when she rebuilt her house. Rose’s new home, set on an idyllic, willow-fringed stretch of the Thames, downstream from Marlow, has been flood- and future-proofed in ways that belie the simplicity of its architecture.</p><p>The single-storey house, designed by London architects <a href="https://knoxbhavan.co.uk/" title="">Knox Bhavan</a>, was loosely inspired by the Edwardian houseboats that once lined the riverbank, and has just won the prestigious <em><a href="https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/manser-medal-aj-house-of-the-year-2022-winner-revealed" title="">Architects’ Journal</a></em><a href="https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/manser-medal-aj-house-of-the-year-2022-winner-revealed" title=""> House of the Year award</a>. The building replaced Rose’s former home – a “difficult” 1920s property where she lived for 17 years. “We looked into renovating it, but for all the things we wanted to achieve – energy efficiency, climate-proofing – it turned out to be more effective to start again,” says the former dancer. Besides, plots like these are rarities because most are handed down from generation to generation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/10/flood-proof-riverside-living-a-house-on-the-thames-without-the-anxiety">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Analog Africa)<br />Beach meets jungle on this classy compilation of vintage cumbia</p><p>The lopsided, scratchy rhythms of cumbia, the music of Colombia and Peru, have enjoyed growing popularity in recent years, be it via antique recordings or slick, electro updates, many of them from Argentina. On <em><a href="https://analogafrica.bandcamp.com/album/per-selv-tico-sonic-expedition-into-the-peruvian-amazon-1972-1986-analog-africa-no-36">Perú Selvático</a></em>, pop archaeology explores some of cumbia’s most distant shores, specifically those of the upper Amazon in the 1970s, where towns hundreds of miles from the capital, Lima, spawned their own variations on the genre. Central to many of its 18 tracks is the twang of surf guitar, by then a bygone fad in its California birthplace but still hugely popular across swathes of South America. (Currently, much the same sound is being championed by <a href="https://losbitchos.com/">Los Bitchos</a>, a chi-chi female four-piece from London.)</p><p>The sonic novelties of electric guitar, squeaky Farfisa organ and proto-synths replaced the accordions and big bands that dominated traditional cumbia; modernism had reached Amazonia. Remote cities such as Moyobamba and Tarapoto had no studios but their local heroes found their way to Lima to record. The results are all instrumental, although there are plentiful shouts and exhortations keeping the beat alive, and the party swinging on tracks such as Humo En La Selva by Los Invasores de Progreso. Nicely packaged vintage fun. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/10/peru-selvatico-sonic-expedition-into-the-peruvian-amazon-1972-1986-review">Continue reading...</a>

It is all very exciting and strange. I have a student room, and this morning I ate my breakfast – properly buttered toast, for I am properly in the north – alongside a handful of bleary-eyed undergraduates in a place called the Pantry. Scarf trailing, I walk the campus, rather bleak in winter, and remember what it was like to be young. Where did all the years go? Larkin, of course, is the perfect soundtrack for this kind of melancholy.</p><p>I talked about Larkin and cancel culture: looking back, he was a canary in the coal mine, a sign of things to come. Others have spoken on Larkin and Auden, Larkin and national service (which he did not do), and Larkin and childhood (which famously bored him); Prof Esther Johnson of Sheffield Hallam University and her colleague Vicky Foster delivered a presentation about Hull’s once magnificent 1960s Co-op, a building that, even if it didn’t inspire it, brings to mind <em>Here</em>, Larkin’s gorgeous poem about the city (<em>Cheap suits, red kitchen-ware, sharp shoes, iced lollies / Electric mixers, toasters, washers, driers</em>).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/10/philip-larkin-a-canary-in-the-coalmine-of-cancel-culture">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Most of us only use it to reheat or defrost food, but the microwave was once an exciting new frontier of cooking. Could it be our secret weapon in the cost-of-living crisis?</p><p>• Plus, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/dec/08/12-top-chefs-tips-get-most-out-of-microwave">12 chefs’ top tips</a> to get the most out of your microwave</p><p>In 2020, Nigella Lawson almost broke the internet just by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KrUxLBHVu8" title="">saying the word “microwave”</a>. The food writer was heating milk for mashed potatoes on her TV series Cook, Eat, Repeat when she commented that she liked to heat the milk in a <em>mee-crow-waa-vay</em>, as if it were some kind of obscure yet deeply sophisticated European food gadget. It was a joke, clearly, but some people didn’t understand this and Nigella was forced to explain that she did actually know how microwave was normally pronounced. By the following year, the clip of Nigella saying “mee-crow-waa-vay” had become so popular it was nominated for a Bafta.</p><p>The joke works only because the microwave is generally so undervalued as a kitchen item. It’s hard to think of another household object owned by so many and praised by so few. In 2018, 93% of UK households owned a microwave oven, up from 67% in 1994. Yet when the microwave is spoken of, it is usually in negative terms. We jest of “nuking” or “zapping” food, or we talk disparagingly of “microwave dinners”, as if the technology’s only real use were heating up ready meals. The American food writer Michael Pollan spoke for many when he protested – in his book Cooked – that “the microwave oven is as antisocial as the cook fire is communal”. In an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/may/25/michael-pollan-family-meal-civilisation" title="">interview with the Guardian</a> in 2013, Pollan commented that, “nobody wants to get too close to a microwave. It gives them the willies because of the mysterious waves jumping around inside.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/dec/10/ping-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-microwave">Continue reading...</a>

If the original gave Jennens the vapours, one shudders to think what he would have suffered after seeing the costumes, dancing and light show that “enhanced” <a href="https://lwtheatres.co.uk/whats-on/handels-messiah/">its latest incarnation</a> at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.

It is not a form of entertainment that most people can relate to.” Really? He plainly hasn’t been in an opera house recently. He has no doubt that composers “would approve of finding exciting new approaches to performing their music, especially in ways designed to augment and enhance the spirit and narrative”. That’s fine, but this <strong>Messiah</strong><em> </em>had exactly the opposite effect, muddying its message, cluttering its presentation and crippling the flow of the narrative.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/10/handel-messiah-the-live-experience-theatre-royal-drury-lane-manchester-collective-places-we-know-purcell-room-london">Continue reading...</a>

This was the 1950s, she says, when “children were not supposed to comment on the things adults were saying. It was called talking back, and you were not allowed to do that. Even as a small child, this seemed unfair to me. In school I would get sent out of the classroom even though the other kids made it clear they wanted to hear what I had to say. So it did amuse me, when I got much older, that the thing I got punished for I was now getting paid for.”</p><p>At 72, Lebowitz’s opinions – acerbic, unfiltered, nearly always right – have rarely been more in demand. After publishing two bestselling books, Metropolitan Life (1978) and Social Studies (1981) early in her career, she developed writer’s block – she prefers to call it “writer’s blockade” – and reinvented herself as a public speaker. In the 2021 Netflix series Pretend It’s a City, directed by her friend Martin Scorsese (it’s his second Lebowitz documentary; the first was 2010’s Public Speaking), you can find her holding forth about her home of New York, from the smoking ban to the subway to the lawn chairs dotted about on Times Square. With its lingering shots of her walking the streets in her signature get-up – Anderson &amp; Sheppard coat, white shirt, jeans, chunky boots – the series cemented Lebowitz’s status as a style icon and introduced her to a new generation of fans, many of whom now accost her on the street. “They say: ‘I came to New York because I thought I’d see you and now I did.’ I say: ‘Well, of course, because it’s a very small place and I walk around a lot. So naturally you saw me.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/10/fran-lebowitz-new-york-writer-essayist-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Ovid to George Orwell, writers have long been inspired by the natural world. Fifty years after the publication of Watership Down, Katherine Rundell celebrates the authors who have taken a walk on the wild side</p><p>What is the bite of animal stories? They are a good place to go to understand humans: the place where our anxieties and hopes, our hungers and terrors, leak out most vividly. For thousands of years we have offered them to children, to convey our ideals under cover of animal faces.</p><p>The story of how the panda got her markings, for example, is told to children in both China and Tibet. It explains how long ago a shepherdess, guarding her sheep, was joined every day by a panda cub. Back in those early days, all pandas were snow white, and possibly the cub believed the sheep were pandas. One day, as the panda cub was gambolling clumsily with the lambs, a leopard attacked it. The shepherdess threw herself in front of the panda, and was killed. The panda cub and his family came in sombre gratitude to the shepherdess’s funeral, and out of respect they covered their arms with black ashes, as was the custom. As the funeral went on, they wept, wiping their eyes with their paws and staining them black. As their weeping grew louder, they covered their ears, so that they would not have to hear their own sobs. The ash never washed off, and therefore they are forever marked with signs of their love and grief, their ongoing fealty to bravery.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/10/stories-with-teeth-how-animal-tales-help-us-understand-humans">Continue reading...</a>

It’s indispensable for brightening dark circles and hiding discoloration and blemishes. And yet it’s the product that most dissatisfies wearers.</p><p>People want crease-free, smooth, moist, lasting camouflage, but here’s the rub: a “matte” concealer will typically offer coverage and longevity in return for looking a little dry as the day wears on. A “radiant” concealer will generally be moisturising to circumvent this, but will usually settle a little in fine lines. This is technically unavoidable, and so choosing the right one is really a question of looking at your skin’s natural characteristics and compromising a bit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/dec/10/makeup-concealer-advice">Continue reading...</a>

Reading them, what is most striking is how bold their experiment in living was – and how depressingly our concept of the family has narrowed since the 1920s.</p><p>When they met at Oxford in 1919, both women seemed destined to be unmarried. Brittain had lost her sweetheart in the war. Holtby had never really had one. Like many “surplus women”, they moved in together. Holtby was tall, blond and breezily down on her writing; in the first letter here she calls a story of hers “a loathsome thing; but I <em>had </em>to write it … but I think it should be burned.” Brittain was short, dark and anxious. When Holtby was published first, she wrote, shaken, “Almost I think of you as if you were a stranger; we are not equals any more.” She needed a lot of encouragement, which is may be one reason why she fell for the charms of political scientist Gordon Catlin, who first wrote to her as a fan of her prose.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/10/between-friends-review-the-letters-of-vera-brittain-and-winifred-holtby">Continue reading...</a>

The song is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBv0ke87g4w" title="">Run, Woman, Run</a>, a standard from 1970 in which Wynette, in customary style, exhorts women to stop being so demanding and knuckle down to life with any man who will have them. Or, as Chastain puts it: “Basically, you’re not going to find someone else, so go back to your man.”</p><p>On the day of filming, this presented the 45-year-old actor with a problem. Chastain, who took on the role partly to rescue Wynette from what she saw as decades of unfair feminist dismissal, is drawn to characters with room for ambivalence.

<p>An isolated hideaway near Kitzbühel is the perfect base for a family skiing trip – and an opportunity to indulge in naked moonbathing</p><p>The night was as dark as the bottom of a well when I pushed open the old timber door, releasing a wraith-like furl of steam into the frost-glittered air.

<p>I trip over a bird feeder lying in the blackness.

That same afternoon, clouds appear and a stiff wind drives the remaining leaves from the cherry tree, affording me an uninterrupted view of a heavy, boiled-wool sky. Then it gets dark.</p><p>Heading back toward the kitchen at the end of the day, I trip over a bird feeder lying on its side in the blackness. Almost as soon as I regain my balance, I step on a rake.
