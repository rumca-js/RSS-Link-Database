Then he fell off because a) the internet was invented and everyone started producing low-information progressive content, and b) no one likes him. They just liked that he hated the right people. Now, Keithums is facing his final indignity. He's hosting a podcast. And one where he complains about his ex-girlfriend, MSNBC teleprompter reader Katy Tur.

Tur's husband got a vasectomy. Olbermann is angered by this to no end, for reasons known only to him and the guy working the McDonald's drive-thru. KO bragged about staying quiet about his girlfriend of three years. And that he uncoupled with thirteen years ago. But now he is ready to spill the tea!</p><blockquote>I have remained silent even though six days after her emergency appendectomy in 2007, she started punching and slapping me, with real intent to do harm, because the living room wasn\u2019t clean enough in our place.</blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2a1cf\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32316451&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>Dude.

The second thing you do is get over it and NOT hold a grudge for twelve years. And the third this is you don't whine about it twelve years later. It makes you sound like p-p-p-puuuuuuuusy.</p><p>Olbermann is big into reminding us that he dated girls before.
