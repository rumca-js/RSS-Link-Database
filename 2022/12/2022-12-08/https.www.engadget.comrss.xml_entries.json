Thankfully, <a href=\"https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2022-12-07-flameproofing-lithium-ion-batteries-salt\">research</a> at Stanford might reduce the chances of those devices lighting up. Scientists have developed an electrolyte (the substance that carries lithium ions between electrodes) that won't catch fire even at temperatures of 140F or more.

The LiFSI served as an &quot;anchor&quot; for flammable solvent molecules, preventing them from catching fire.

However, the researchers already see multiple benefits for electric cars. The design could not only lower the risk of EVs catching fire, but increase their range. Automakers frequently need to space lithium-ion battery cells to prevent them from heating each other. This advancement would let companies safely pack more batteries into a given area, allowing either higher capacities or more spacious interiors.</p><p>This could also prove useful for phones, laptops and other mobile devices where space and safety are priorities.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Association (NHTSA) says there have been two crashes and one injury potentially linked to the problem, as well as customer assistance instances, warranty claims and field reports.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Jeep will fix the affected Wranglers by updating calibration software for their hybrid control and transmission processors.

The EU's Court of Justice <a href=\"https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2022-12/cp220197en.pdf\">has ruled</a> that Google and similar providers must remove search results on request when they're &quot;manifestly inaccurate.&quot; People making the demands will have to prove that there are significant falsehoods, but they'll only have to provide evidence that can be &quot;reasonably&quot; required.

If you're curious what that means, in a nutshell, in 2020 the FCC opened up more airwaves in the 6Ghz band for WiFi to run on, which allows your home WiFi to get better wireless connections with less congestion.&nbsp;</p><p>Google states that WiFi 6E will be up to twice as fast as the previous WiFi 6 standard. Of course, only devices that are WiFi 6E compatible will be able to access the new airwaves. But since these routers are tri-band, they also provide access to the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz and 6 GHz frequency bands, meaning any device that currently runs on your WiFi will also run on these routers. Also keep in mind that these don't replace your modem, one router plugs into your ISP's modem or gateway (a combined modem router).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A single Nest WiFi Pro unit will extend coverage to a home up to 2,200 square feet. With three routers, you'll get up to 6,600 square feet of coverage. The routers are also ready to act as a hub that will work with Matter, Google's forthcoming smart home industry standard that's intended to bring more universal connectivity (as in, working with Apple, Samsung and Amazon devices) to the smart home landscape. It'll also make new smart home devices easier to set up and use. Matter is scheduled for this Fall and these Nest WiFi Pro routers will be ready when the service launches.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-ad-supported-plan-live-premium-price-increase-162818934.html?src=rss", "title": "Disney+ launches $8 ad-supported plan, raises price on ad-free streaming", "date_published": "2022-12-08 16:28:18+00:00", "description": "<p>If you want to keep using <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=85d85ef3-fac9-418f-9573-418cf162cd0c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Disney%2B&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4NWQ4NWVmMy1mYWM5LTQxOGYtOTU3My00MThjZjE2MmNkMGMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzbmV5cGx1cy5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiMmU5OWZlNS1hYmRiLTQxODctODViMy0zNTRmNTBiZDhmMTMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQ16C6Lv3gscfRB-FBaNKKGmP1le2sgHGIrDspD44Qqc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F\"><ins>Disney+</ins></a> at the same price you've been paying each month <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-price-012056437.html\"><ins>since March last year</ins></a>, you'll need to put up with some ads starting today.

As we saw during our first preview, it's a genuinely unique behemoth of a display, one that can easily immerse you in both <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> and towering Excel spreadsheets.</p><p>Sure, you could just plug a 55-inch TV into your PC, but without the Ark's extreme curve, it would be too wide to comfortably use as a monitor. You also won't find any 4K TVs with the Ark's blazing fast 165Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time, let alone its surprisingly solid sound system. The Odyssey Ark stands alone. But is it actually worth $3,500? That depends on if you're able to live with its many annoyances (and if you don't think too hard about the price).</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Annoyance number one? This thing is a bear to set up. Even with the help of two delivery workers, it took around 20 minutes to get the (very heavy) Ark monitor correctly attached to its (equally heavy) base. The entire unit weighs 91.5 pounds when put together, so be sure to have a sturdy desk at the ready. If that sounds a bit obscene, well, you'd be correct. Samsung's 55-inch QN90B NEO QLED TV weighs almost half as much (48.3 pounds), while LG's 65-inch C2 OLED TV clocks in at 72 pounds. Extreme heft is the unfortunate price you'll have to pay for a rotating monitor stand.</p><figure><img alt=\"Samsung Odyssey Ark front view\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/46b46420-764d-11ed-b5fd-3e92607d50da\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>As soon as I sat in front of the Odyssey Ark, I understood why Samsung dared to build it. We've already seen its extra-wide 49-inch gaming monitors in action. And, of course the company that pushed the limits of phone screens would do the same for PCs. Given Samsung's robust TV business, it makes sense to explore the many other ways it could use 55-inch Mini LED panels. (The TV side is where we also saw <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-29-samsung-the-sero-vertical-tv.html\">Samsung debut screens</a> that could rotate into TikTok-friendly portrait mode.) The Ark may not be entirely practical, but for Samsung it serves as a showcase for many of its display innovations.</p><p>Design-wise, the Odyssey Ark resembles Samsung's TVs more than its gaming monitors. It has a sturdy metal base (as it should, given its size), as well as a smooth metal case surrounding the curvy screen. It even comes with Samsung's One Connect breakout-box, one of the company's more intriguing TV inventions. It connects to the Ark over a single cable, while the box itself handles power and all of your typical connections (four HDMI 2.1 ports, an optical audio connection, 3.5mm headphone jack and two USB ports). While it was originally meant for screens you'd be mounting on walls, it's a welcome addition to the Odyssey Ark \u2014 nobody wants to push a near 100-pound beast around just to get to HDMI ports.</p><figure><img alt=\"Samsung Ark Odyssey one connect dock\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/141587d0-7650-11ed-97bf-1c84cdcdf30f\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung includes two ways to control the Ark: A simple remote with a directional pad and shortcuts for streaming apps like Netflix, as well as a dial for quickly managing the Ark's many different viewing modes. Both controllers are solar powered, so you'll just need to make sure they get a bit of light to keep running. I'd imagine that could be an issue in window-less offices like mine, but it wouldn't be that tough to place the remotes by a window every few months. On the plus side, they should be able to run indefinitely if you're lucky enough to have some light. (Solar cells can be charged by artificial lighting, but not very efficiently.)</p><figure><img alt=\"Samsung Ark Odyssey remotes\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/1414eb90-7650-11ed-afdb-35a130a73829\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Ark's odd shape, as well as a few LED lighting strips on the rear, are the major signs that it's not a mere TV set. I've been in front of plenty of curved screens before, but nothing this extreme. The sides of the display almost seem like they're trying to embrace you with 4K Mini-LED goodness. It's an effective bit of immersion while you're viewing the Ark in its standard widescreen mode, reminiscent of specialized theaters like LA's Cinerama Dome. And unlike most TVs and monitors, the Ark's large frame allows it to house a six speaker sound system (four tweeters and two woofers), which delivers the audio punch of a medium-sized soundbar.</p><p>The combination of expansive sound and a wonderfully immersive picture make the Odyssey Ark a truly unique viewing experience. Movies, TV shows, and even trailers felt like they were drawing me into the action, so much so that I barely noticed the slight distortion from the curved sides of the screen. But while the Ark's sweet spot is indeed very sweet, showing off the added brightness of Mini-LED and the expansive color range from its Quantum Dot display, its viewing angle is incredibly limited. Just a few steps off the center and you immediately lose color and clarity.

On the PC side, it can reach up to a 165Hz refresh rate, allowing for frenetic gaming at incredibly high framerates. Samsung has baked in multiple ways to take advantage of its massive screen size: Its \"Multi View\" mode lets you display up to three different apps at once. That can include a single HDMI video input, as well as a device mirrored wirelessly (using AirPlay or the Android equivalent). Additionally, there's a \"Flex View\" mode that lets you shrink an input down so it doesn't fill up the whole screen.</p><p>Now why would you want to do that? I quickly learned that playing fast-paced shooters like <em>Overwatch 2 </em>and <em>Halo Infinite</em> were overwhelming when sitting a few feet away from a 55-inch screen. Sure, I could see more detail, but moving the camera around quickly and trying to track potential enemies was nausea-inducing. I didn't mind sitting close to the screen for slower-paced games like <em>A Plague Tale: Requiem</em>, but for shooters I'd prefer moving the screen further back. Unfortunately, that just wasn't possible in my cramped basement office, so I occasionally used Flex View mode to shrink faster games down to size.</p><figure><img alt=\"Samsung Ark Odyssey multiview\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/140f4640-7650-11ed-bfef-040082de1947\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Ark also features built-in apps for every major game streaming service: Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Geforce Now, Amazon Luna, and yes even Google\u2019s short-lived Stadia (that dies next month). You can easily pair Bluetooth controllers with the Ark directly, allowing you to treat it like an oversized console. I had no trouble signing into Game Pass and going through a few races in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, but as usual, your streaming experience will depend on the quality of your internet.</p><p>On the non-gaming front, I learned that moving to a 55-inch screen still required a bit of an adjustment. I typically use a 34-inch ultrawide monitor, which gives me a decent amount of horizontal space without being too overwhelming vertically. But sitting in front of the Odyssey Ark almost felt like sitting directly in front of the monolith from <em>2001</em> \u2014 there's just <em>so much screen</em>. After 30 minutes or so, I got used to using Slack, Evernote and my many browser tabs on a big screen. But when it came to focused writing and other work, the Ark was overkill. I wrote this review on the Ark during small sessions, but I just couldn't stick with it for too long.</p><figure><img alt=\"Samsung Ark Odyssey portrait mode\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/141512a0-7650-11ed-bf1a-db2499a40756\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung's unique portrait view, or \"Cockpit Mode,\" was similarly overpowering. It's easy to rotate the Ark between that and its typical landscape mode \u2014 you just have to push the screen to the top of the base and push along its left side \u2014 but I found the taller view genuinely off-putting. Instead of a warm embrace, it was honestly a bit threatening, as if my body was instinctively worried about the Ark toppling over.</p><p>It's easy to make Windows 11 recognize a portrait display, but I didn't find it too useful for my typical work. (Though I'd imagine some <em>Flight Simulator</em> fans may enjoy trying to tweak the game for a genuine cockpit view). Instead, the portrait orientation was better suited to the Ark's Multi View mode, allowing me to play a PC game in a small 31-inch square while I left a YouTube video running in another window on top, and my phone mirrored right above it. It's just a shame that Multi View mode doesn't currently support streaming video apps like Netflix. Also, you can only hear audio from up to two sources at once. (And if this sounds like pure information overload, well, it is.)</p><section><img alt=\"Samsung Odyssey Ark desk view in portrait mode\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/46b46422-764d-11ed-bbbf-23fef9849c0d\" /></section><p>For whatever reason, the Ark did an awful job of downscaling my PC's desktop in Multi View mode, even after tweaking the resolution several times. Text was hard to read and images were blurry, as if I was looking at everything through a pair of dirty glasses. Fighting with that feature also made it clear how the Ark often pales in comparison to having a typical multi-monitor setup. It's not that hard to have another monitor sitting beside your standard screen, and that also wouldn't involve any sort of distortion. You're also more free to tweak the way external monitors are positioned and laid out, rather than working within the confines of Samsung's software.</p><p>Most importantly, though, a multi-monitor setup would be vastly cheaper than the Odyssey Ark's $3,500 retail price. (It's currently marked down to $2,500 for the holidays, but it's unclear if that will stick.) You could easily pick up a 55-inch OLED TV and a few PC monitors for less than $2,5000. Or my personal recommendation: Get <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/alienware-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-ultrawide-review-140012704.html\">Alienware's fantastic QD-OLED ultrawide monitor</a> for $1,299 and an assortment of other screens. Whichever direction you go, it'll be far more practical than having a single 55-inch display on your desk.</p><figure><img alt=\"Samsung Odyssey Ark top of portrait mode\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/46b46421-764d-11ed-90da-c32e4197ccef\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>As my honeymoon period with the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvY29tcHV0aW5nL21vbml0b3JzL2dhbWluZy81NS1vZHlzc2V5LWFyay00ay11aGQtMTY1aHotMW1zLXF1YW50dW0tbWluaS1sZWQtY3VydmVkLWdhbWluZy1zY3JlZW4tbHM1NWJnOTcwbm54Z28vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2OTM4YmU3ZC05N2UzLTQxOWYtODBjMi1hZmRjZGVkMTcxODUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQkQFVuJYD0vwHT0DN4w8agIoXXl9x4bNi71uZCuf-Js&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fmonitors%2Fgaming%2F55-odyssey-ark-4k-uhd-165hz-1ms-quantum-mini-led-curved-gaming-screen-ls55bg970nnxgo%2F\">Odyssey Ark</a> faded, I was left with nothing but questions.

Specifically, Dyson didn\u2019t announce pricing or availability, nor did it say much about battery life. On Wednesday, it shared that information. Let\u2019s begin with the detail everyone wants to know. When the wearable arrives in the US next March, it will start at an eye-watering $949, making it almost twice as expensive as the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326.html\"><ins>AirPods Max</ins></a>.</p><p>At first, Dyson will begin accepting preorders by appointment only before the headphones become available through its website and Demo stores across the country. In the US, the company will offer the wearable in two colorways: Ultra Blue/Prussian Blue and Prussian Blue/Bright Copper. The latter will only be available directly from the company, but it comes with a few extras, including a second electrostatic carbon filter, a soft pouch and an inflight adaptor kit.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"333ca862e43f4861b20abc48baca499b\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Both the standard and Dyson Direct models come with the Zone\u2019s signature vizor, as well as a dedicated sleeve and cleaning brush. According to Dyson, the electrostatic filters are rated to provide up to 12 months of use before they should be replaced. The filters feature a dual-layer design that incorporates potassium-enriched carbon to capture acidic gasses like nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and ozone. All told, the company claims the filters will block 99 percent of particles, including ones that are as small as 0.1 microns.</p><p>On the audio front, the Zone headphones are capable of up to 38 decibels of noise cancellation and feature 40-millimeter neodymium drivers. You can use the MyDyson companion app to choose between three audio equalization modes dubbed Dyson EQ, Bass Boost and Neutral. At launch, the headphones will support SBC, AAC and LHDC audio codecs, as well as Bluetooth 5.0.</p><p>Battery life will depend on how extensively you use the Zone\u2019s air filtration feature. If it\u2019s not powering the Visor, the Zone\u2019s 2,600mAh battery can provide up to 50 hours of listening time on a single charge. Using the visor at its slowest setting reduces battery life to a modest four hours. Increasing purification speed to the \u201cMid\u201d and \u201cHigh\u201d flow settings further reduces battery life to two-and-a-half hours and one-and-a-half hours, respectively. Using USB-C charging, Dyson says it will take about three hours to take the battery from dead to 100 percent. All of that means you will need to be selective about when you decide to use the visor.</p>", "persistent": false}]
