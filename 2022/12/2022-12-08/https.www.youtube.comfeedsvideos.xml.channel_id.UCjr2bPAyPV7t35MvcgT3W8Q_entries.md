Kurzgesagt is not just a popular science outreach channel. It's a major tool for propaganda of their billionaire sponsors.

Kurzgesagt received estimated $7 million from billionaire funds. This would be more money than Kurzgesagt received from their supporters on Patreon (estimated $3.5 million) in the entire history of the channel.

Kurzgesagt never was this small, independent, almost entirely viewer-funded channel. As soon as the studio incorporated, billionaires began lining up. They transformed the small Munich-based design studio with 5 employees into a multi-million-dollar media powerhouse with dozens of employees.
