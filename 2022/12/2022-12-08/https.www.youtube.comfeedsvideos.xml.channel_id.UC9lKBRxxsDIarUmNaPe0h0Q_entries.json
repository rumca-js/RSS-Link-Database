In fact, you're being told two main lies: the first is how high inflation actually is. But the second is who is truly responsible for a large part of inflation happening.\n\nWhen we hear about inflation, we're told that it's primarily caused by the simple economics of money in the system. More money is printed, resulting in dollars becoming devalued, resulting in stuff getting more expensive. And yes, this is definitely a part of the inflation equation. However, there's a part that's often missed that in many cases, causes prices around us to rise as well.\n\nTo put it simply, it's all about corporate greed. And the desire of many companies to use inflation as a cover story for rising prices, so they can line their pockets. It's only possible they can do this due to lack of competition, which is something we don't think we have in today's world.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts below.\n\n0:00 - The big lies about inflation\n0:55 - LIE 1: How high inflation really is\n3:00 - The main narrative around inflation\n3:26 - LIE 2: What is causing inflation\n5:17 - Why competition is a myth\n6:59 - Concentration of corporate power\n\n\u25ba IMPORTANT LINKS:\nEnter your email via the link below for free weekly lessons and insights into becoming financially free, investing, global tax and corporate structures, passports, residencies, and more.\nJOIN: https://www.abundantia.co/\n\n\u25ba SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u2022 Abundantia Instagram: @abundantia.co https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/\n\u2022 Sorelle's Instagram: @sorelleamore  https://instagram.com/sorelleamore\n\u2022 Leon's Instagram: @leonhill  https://instagram.com/leonhill\n\u2022 Abundantia Twitter: https://twitter.com/abundantiaco\n\u2022 Abundantia Facebook: http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance\n\nSorelle and Leon.\nFounders, Abundantia\n\nLiability Disclaimer: https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer\n*We may earn a commission if you buy any products or services via the links in this video's description.
