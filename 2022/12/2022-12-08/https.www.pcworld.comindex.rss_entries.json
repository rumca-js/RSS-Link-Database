But a video shows you <em>how</em> something is done, capturing the process for others to share. Weirdly, there hasn&rsquo;t been a great way within Windows to capture that, save for the relatively <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/708192/how-to-use-clipchamp-microsofts-video-editor.html\">recent Clipchamp app</a> and its ability to capture video of you interacting with Windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, Microsoft is changing this. If you&rsquo;re part of the Windows Insider program and specifically the Dev Channel, you should be seeing an updated version (version 11.2211.35.0) roll out over the next few days. That version&mdash;which will not be available to all Dev Channel testers, sadly&mdash;will add the new screen recorder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll see the new &ldquo;Record&rdquo; feature next to the existing &ldquo;Snip&rdquo; button within the Screen Recorder. In a nice touch, Microsoft will allow you to predefine that area that you want to capture before getting started. You&rsquo;ll also have the ability to preview your recording before sharing it.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 Snipping tool screen recorder\" class=\"wp-image-1430290\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Windows-Snipping-tool-screen-recorder-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"782\" /><figcaption>A new Record button will sit alongside &ldquo;Snip&rdquo; in the Snipping Tool app.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Microsoft</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s blog post explaining the new feature doesn&rsquo;t say if there&rsquo;s a time limit to the recording. (A screenshot of the new tool shows a recording paused at over 30 minutes, however.) Nor does Microsoft say which formats you&rsquo;ll be able to save in, and whether that will include MP4 video and/or GIFs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, it&rsquo;s a nice hint that such a feature will be headed to Windows proper before long, giving you (or us) another way to show others how to work within Windows. </p>\n\nWindows 11</div>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1430050/ftc-sues-to-block-microsofts-activision-gaming-deal.html", "title": "Game over?

The FTC pointed to Microsoft&rsquo;s decision to make several Bethesda titles, including <em>Starfield</em> and <em>Redfall</em>, Microsoft exclusives after buying the ZeniMax, the parent of Bethesda Software. That contradicted statements that Microsoft had made to European antitrust investigators, the agency said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Microsoft has already shown that it can and will withhold content from its gaming rivals,&rdquo; said Holly Vedova, director of the FTC&rsquo;s Bureau of Competition, in a statement. &ldquo;Today we seek to stop Microsoft from gaining control over a leading independent game studio and using it to harm competition in multiple dynamic and fast-growing gaming markets.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FTC&rsquo;s job is to preserve competition for consumers, and the agency said that it has a reason to believe that competition would be harmed if the deal proceeds. The FTC said that the complaint itself would be released soon.</p>\n\nGaming</div>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1429957/chromes-memory-hog-is-going-on-a-diet.html", "title": "Google Chrome is a memory hog, but it\u2019s going on a diet", "date_published": "2022-12-08 20:03:18+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Google Chrome has long had a reputation of being fast, secure&hellip; and ravenous for memory like a starving teenager at an all-you-can-eat buffet. But finally, Chrome is going to slim down right in time for the new year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the next few weeks, Chrome will be adding two new features, Memory Saver and Battery Saver, on Windows, Macs and Chromebooks alike, Google said Tuesday. Google <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> say when exactly when these new features will show up in your browser, just that they will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The features work pretty much as advertised. Memory Saver is being pitched as a &ldquo;smoother-running browser experience,&rdquo; promising to save up to 30 percent more memory when running Chrome. How? By freeing up memory from tabs that you aren&rsquo;t actively using. If a tab is idling, it will essentially be put into a static mode where its resources will be available elsewhere, then reloaded if needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is especially useful if you&rsquo;re running other intensive applications, like editing family videos or playing games,&rdquo; Google said in a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.google/products/chrome/new-chrome-features-to-save-battery-and-make-browsing-smoother/&amp;xcust=2-1-1429957-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post</a> announcing the new feature. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Google Chrome Memory Saver\" class=\"wp-image-1429980\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Memory-Saver_mode-Chrome.gif\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption>Google Chrome&rsquo;s Memory Saver is designed to limit its memory intake.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Google</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If this seems somewhat familiar, it should. Microsoft Edge already can put tabs to sleep to save resources. If you have dozens of tabs open in Edge, several probably won&rsquo;t be in active use. You&rsquo;ll see the tabbed icons along the top of the browser window visually faded out, to indicate their status. Hover over them, and Edge will tell you that the tab is sleeping, as well as how much memory that&rsquo;s saving. In Chrome, Google plans to put controls for this feature in the &ldquo;ellipsis&rdquo; menu to the upper right, though it will be on by default. (Why turn it off? If you have a frequently-updated tab like Twitter, you might want to keep it active.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Energy Saver acts in a similar manner. If your laptop&rsquo;s battery level drops to 20 percent, Google Chrome will enter Energy Saver mode and start conserving power: limiting background activity and visual effects for those sites which use them. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Microsoft Edge Efficiency Mode\" class=\"wp-image-1429990\" height=\"731\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Edge-efficiency-mode.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>You can find  Edge&rsquo;s Efficiency Mode in its Settings menu.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, Microsoft was first to announce a similar battery-saving mode, which it announced in October in conjunction with Edge 106. (The current version at press time is version 107.) Edge&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/efficiency-mode-in-microsoft-edge-save-even-more-battery-life/m-p/3651853&amp;xcust=2-1-1429957-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">efficiency mode</a>&rdquo; is a bit more sophisticated: it offers various tradeoffs to preserve battery life in various states, such as being unplugged as well as in a low-power state. For example, when your device is unplugged <em>and</em> low on battery, it will have a visual impact on your browsing experience, making videos less smooth, for example. You can enter the Edge Settings menu to adjust it, if you wish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Edge and Chrome are built on Chromium, though, so it seems natural that they&rsquo;d share some features. Whichever browser you choose, though, you&rsquo;ll benefit.</p>\n\nBrowsers</div>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1421782/how-to-add-check-boxes-to-microsoft-word-documents.html", "title": "How to add check boxes to Microsoft Word documents", "date_published": "2022-12-08 15:30:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re writing the next greatest novel or a simple grocery list, Microsoft Word is used for all types of things.

Well, let&rsquo;s dive in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Razer Viper wireless gaming mouse has eight programmable buttons, a maximum sensitivity of 20,000 DPI, and colorful RGB lighting. 20,000 DPI is extremely fast and responsive, which is great for competitive gamers. That said, if you&rsquo;re new to gaming mice, take some time to work up to the maximum DPI. The mouse also has an ambidextrous design and a claw grip/fingertip grip mouse grip style. The included charging dock really ups the value of this particular deal.

I&rsquo;m something of a Chromebook stan, as I dig the barebones nature of them. This is the first Chromebook in the manufacturer&rsquo;s eco-friendly Vero line, which is exciting news for eco-conscious buyers. Not only are you reducing your e-waste with this machine, as it&rsquo;s made of recycled materials, but you&rsquo;re also getting pretty good hardware for the price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From strong CPU performance to a bright 1080p display, the Acer Chromebook Vero 514 has a lot to offer. Battery life is good and the unpainted exterior is totally unique. Even the packaging it comes in consists of mostly recycled paper and cardboard. However, audio quality is underwhelming and you&rsquo;re stuck using ChromeOS. If you can live with those nitpicks, then this machine is well worth considering. It&rsquo;s affordable, sustainable, and a reliable performer.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Note: This review is part of our ongoing roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/608636/best-chromebooks.html\">best Chromebooks</a>.

It&rsquo;s packing an Intel Core i5-1235U CPU, Intel Iris Xe graphics, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of SSD storage. The 14-inch display has a resolution of 1920&times;1080 and a refresh rate of 60Hz. An alternate configuration has an Intel Core i3-1215U CPU, Intel Iris Xe graphics, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of SSD storage. That one costs $499.99. For more details regarding our review unit, check out the bulleted list below:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5-1235U</li><li>Graphics: Intel Iris Xe</li><li>RAM: 8GB</li><li>Storage: 256GB SSD</li><li>Display: 14-inch, 1920&times;1080</li><li>Ports: HDMI, USB 3.2 Type-A, USB 3.2 Type-C</li><li>Weight: 3.09 lbs</li><li>Color: Cobblestone gray</li><li>Battery capacity: 56Wh</li><li>Price: $599.99</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"acer-chromebook-vero-514-design-and-build\">Acer Chromebook Vero 514: Design and build</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Acer Chromebook Vero 514 exterior\" class=\"wp-image-1427137\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exterior-of-laptop.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Ashley Biancuzzo</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chromebook Vero has one of the most unique color schemes I&rsquo;ve ever seen and I&rsquo;m so here for it. The unassuming gray exterior is covered in yellow and dark blue flecks. It&rsquo;s not paint, but the colors of the recycled materials the laptop is made out of. Cool, right? I tend to prefer laptops with an unusual or eye-catching aesthetic and the Chromebook Vero definitely delivers here. It may not be for everyone, but I deeply appreciate the outside-the-box design. The banana yellow accents on the bottom and sides of the machine are really eye-catching, too.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Acer Chromebook Vero 514 back of laptop\" class=\"wp-image-1427138\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/back-of-laptop-flipped.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Ashley Biancuzzo</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a tactile person like me, the unusual texture of the recycled material might be different from what you&rsquo;re used to. Most laptops have a smooth plastic exterior. The Vero, by comparison, feels a little rough to the touch. That said, it&rsquo;s not unpleasant. I found myself rubbing the corners of the machine as I watched YouTube videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I expected the build quality to be subpar given the&nbsp;recycled materials, but I couldn&rsquo;t have been more wrong. The Vero feels both durable and solid overall. I didn&rsquo;t notice any bend in the keyboard tray and the display hardly twisted when I pushed and pulled on it with both hands. This Chromebook definitely feels like it could handle a good knock or two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chromebook Vero is pretty darn lightweight, too. It weighs just a little over three pounds. The weight surprised me, as the Vero has a box-like shape and looks heavier than it really is. The weight puts it in the ultraportable category, which is great news if you travel often. I also used this machine for hours on my lap and the underside never got uncomfortably warm.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"acer-chromebook-vero-514-keyboard-trackpad-and-webcam\">Acer Chromebook Vero 514: Keyboard, trackpad, and webcam</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Chromebook Vero 514 keyboard and trackpad\" class=\"wp-image-1427133\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Ashley Biancuzzo</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m a clumsy typist. Always have been. Always will be. Whenever I&rsquo;m working with a laptop, it takes me a good amount of time to get accustomed to the keyboard and trackpad. Fortunately, that wasn&rsquo;t the case with the Chromebook Vero. The backlit keyboard was comfortable to use for long periods and the keys were pleasantly springy under my fingertips. There were very few, if any, mistypes on my part. The E and R keys are also lime green in color, which I really like from an aesthetic standpoint.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The square-shaped trackpad sits directly in the center and is lovely to use. In terms of size, it&rsquo;s just right, not too big and not too small. The surface of the trackpad is smooth and responds well to scrolling and clicking. Multitouch gestures seem to work just fine as well. According to Acer, the surface of the trackpad is made entirely of ocean-bound plastics. Cool, right? It doesn&rsquo;t feel cheaply constructed, either.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Chromebook Vero 514 webcam pic\" class=\"wp-image-1427181\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/webcampic.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Ashley Biancuzzo</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I like the inclusion of a 1080p webcam, which is a step up from the usual 720p fare. As you can see in the still photo above, colors are relatively accurate and I don&rsquo;t look washed out or grainy. I look a little pale, but I&rsquo;m part vampire so that&rsquo;s par for the course. With remote work becoming more and more common these days, investing in a higher-quality webcam is key, especially if your job involves a great deal of videoconferencing. Having worked from home the past three years, I can&rsquo;t imagine doing my job without a 1080p webcam.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"acer-chromebook-vero-514-display-audio\">Acer Chromebook Vero 514: Display, audio</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Chromebook Vero 513 display\" class=\"wp-image-1427131\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Ashley Biancuzzo</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14-inch 1080p non-touch display is bright and colorful, especially for a sub-$600 laptop. When I watched an episode of <em>Children of the Whales</em>, an anime about a community living atop a moving island, the protagonist&rsquo;s emerald-green tunic was vivid and bright. It&rsquo;s a lovely display for watching Netflix, web surfing, writing, and so on.&nbsp; The bezels are also quite skinny, which means you&rsquo;re getting a good amount of screen. The display never felt cramped as a result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t love the audio quality and I suspect the downward-firing speakers are to blame. When my husband and I were watching <em>The Great British Bake Off</em>, the most wholesome baking competition around, the contestant&rsquo;s voices sounded weirdly tinny at times. I also had to turn the volume up higher than I normally would to hear the rapport between the contestants and judges. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s a deal-breaker, though, as you can always plug in a pair of headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"acer-chromebook-vero-514-connectivity\">Acer Chromebook Vero 514: Connectivity</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Chromebook Vero 514 ports 1\" class=\"wp-image-1427127\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ports-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Ashley Biancuzzo</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Acer Chromebook Vero 514 ports 2\" class=\"wp-image-1427128\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ports-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Ashley Biancuzzo</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chromebook Vero has a nice collection of ports. Flanking the right side is one USB 3.2 Type-A, one USB 3.2 Type-C, and one Kensington lock. On the left, you&rsquo;ll find one HDMI, one USB 3.2 Type-C, and one headphone jack. I like the inclusion of old and new USB ports as well as the full-sized HDMI. This eliminates the need for an adapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"acer-chromebook-vero-514-performance\">Acer Chromebook Vero 514: Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m something of a serial multitasker, which means I regularly operate in a sea of open tabs. It may look chaotic to some, but it&rsquo;s how I work and I won&rsquo;t be shamed for it. Fortunately, the Chromebook Vero 514 keeps pace with someone like me thanks to its Core i5 CPU. I was able to watch a three-part documentary on Peacock while having a myriad of tabs open in the background. You&rsquo;ll often find me jumping back and forth between YouTube videos and Discord messages. Even when I had about 15 tabs open, this laptop handled everything with ease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how the Chromebook Vero performed in various web-based benchmarks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>CrXPRT 2</strong>: 150</li><li><strong>Speedometer</strong>: 250</li><li><strong>Basemark Web 3.0</strong>: 1289.54</li><li><strong>Kraken</strong>: 484.7ms</li><li><strong>Jetstream 2</strong>: 236.57</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The CrXPRT 2 performance benchmark measures a Chromebook&rsquo;s speed and is a good indication of how it handles day-to-day tasks like watching videos, playing games, surfing the web, and so on. Equipped with a 12th-gen Intel Core i5 CPU, the Vero&rsquo;s performance score was 150. The <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/626194/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-an-inexpensive-workhorse-for-the-everyday-person.html\">Acer Chromebook Spin 713</a>, by comparison, has an 11th-gen Intel Core i5 CPU and received a slightly higher performance score of 164. Although there isn&rsquo;t much difference between the two machines as far as performance score goes, I expected the Vero to score higher, especially with the latest-generation CPU. That said, the Vero is still a strong performer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"acer-chromebook-vero-514-battery-life\">Acer Chromebook Vero 514: Battery life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When we ran the CrXPRT 2&nbsp;battery benchmark, which cycles through videos and various tasks until the laptop dies, the Vero lasted about a whopping 14 hours on a single charge. That&rsquo;s a phenomenal result right there, as it far exceeds a typical workday. The phenomenal battery life plus the lightweight form factor make the Vero a solid option for the frequent traveler.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"should-you-buy-the-acer-chromebook-vero-514\">Should you buy the Acer Chromebook Vero 514?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Acer Chromebook Vero 514 is a phenomenal pick for those who want an eco-friendly everyday laptop. The hardware inside promises strong performance and the exterior is both rugged and uniquely designed. In terms of aesthetic and sustainability, it&rsquo;s definitely a welcome change from your typical run-of-the-mill Chromebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are only a couple of downsides to the Vero. The audio is lacking, but that&rsquo;s not too surprising. Laptops aren&rsquo;t known for the best audio. You&rsquo;re also stuck using ChromeOS, which means your apps and game options are limited. If you don&rsquo;t mind those miniscule nitpicks, then the Chromebook Vero 514 is definitely worth considering.</p>\n\nLaptops</div>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1418025/order-this-33g-mini-mouse-by-december-8-and-get-it-by-christmas.html", "title": "Order this 33g Mini Mouse by December 8 and get it by Christmas", "date_published": "2022-12-08 08:00:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s a mouse for every purpose, whether that&rsquo;s gaming or <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/804794/save-half-off-this-beginner-friendly-video-editing-software.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">video editing</a>.
