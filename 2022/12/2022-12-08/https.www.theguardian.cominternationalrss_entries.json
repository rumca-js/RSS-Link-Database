Duras often plundered her own life for subject matter: in The Easy Life she turns to the remote village in south-east France from which her father had come and which she had visited as a teenager. And it features one of the compelling themes of Duras\u2019s own life: her passionate attachment to a brother who died young, a year before she wrote the novel.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/08/the-easy-life-by-marguerite-duras-review-experiments-of-youth\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/dec/08/best-video-games-to-play-in-goblin-mode", "title": "Unsocial hours: the best video games to play in \u2018goblin mode\u2019", "date_published": "2022-12-08 09:00:49+00:00", "description": "<p>Draw the curtains, pull up your weighted blanket and hunker down with these cosy sims, expansive fantasies or, for actual goblins, subterranean dungeon crawlers</p><p>Earlier this week, \u201cgoblin mode\u201d was announced as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/dec/05/goblin-mode-new-oxford-word-of-the-year\">Oxford\u2019s word of the year</a>, bringing a new level of awareness \u2013 and hopefully acceptance \u2013 to this previously misunderstood and maligned lifestyle choice.

She says she has never felt stronger.</p><p>Resistance training, to use the catch-all term for any sort of exercise where you\u2019re working against weight, whether it\u2019s using dumbbells, exercise bands or just your own body weight, has a lot to recommend it. It makes you stronger and more injury-resistant by increasing bone density and strengthening the muscles, ligaments and tendons around your joints. It mitigates the risk of everything from falls to osteoporosis as you age. It can burn calories and reduce body fat more efficiently than cardio, by keeping your metabolism elevated for days after each workout. Plus, it\u2019s more effective for flexibility than certain styles of stretching.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/08/strengthen-your-heart-bones-and-maybe-even-your-brain-a-beginners-guide-to-weight-training-at-any-age\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-us-denounces-putins-loose-talk-on-nuclear-weapons-zelenskiy-reports-fierce-fighting-in-bakhmut", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war live news: US denounces Putin\u2019s \u2018loose talk\u2019 on nuclear weapons; Zelenskiy reports fierce fighting in Bakhmut", "date_published": "2022-12-08 05:36:53+00:00", "description": "<p>US responds to Vladimir Putin\u2019s musing on risks of nuclear war; Ukrainian president says \u2018every metre counts\u2019 defending city in Donetsk region</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/08/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-288-of-the-invasion\">At a glance: what we know on day 288 of the invasion</a></li></ul><p>Vladimir Putin has admitted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/07/russia-ukraine-war-live-blinken-says-us-did-not-enable-ukraine-strikes-inside-russia\">Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine</a> could turn into a \u201clong-term process\u201d as he sought to defend an invasion in which Russian troops have been forced to retreat and even airbases deep inside Russia have come under attack.</p><p>Speaking to members of his personal human rights council on Wednesday, Putin claimed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> would not use nuclear weapons first in any conflict, denied that Russian troops were deserting en masse from the field of battle, and claimed he would not need to mobilise more troops, a process that has caused considerable upheaval in Russia.</p><p>As for the slow process of the special military operation, then, of course, it can be a long-term process,\u201d Putin said.</p><p>But then you mentioned that new territories had appeared.
