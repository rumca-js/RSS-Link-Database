Over the past few days, some cities in China have eased restrictions on epidemic prevention and control, but the road to reopening will be long and bumpy. If infection rates rise further this winter, Communist authorities may tighten controls again.
The three-year-long "zero-covid policy" has cost China dearly. In the time that follows, let's take stock of what it has brought to China. Simply put, it started with the closure of a massive number of small and medium-sized enterprises, the withdrawal of foreign capital, and the bursting of the real estate bubble. The zero-covid policy and lockdown measures first affected the service industry, then the manufacturing sector, and finally the high-end industries.
