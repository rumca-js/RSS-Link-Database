<p>Former striker discusses his World Cup triumphs and heartbreaks, and the current Argentina side’s chances against the Netherlands</p><p>Jorge Valdano should have been at the Monumental; instead he was standing alone in a bar. He can still remember its name: Rincón de la Victoria. Just him and a group of Dutch fans looking at the screen, wondering what might have been. Mention <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/08/netherlands-argentina-past-world-cup-meetings" title="">Argentina and the Netherlands</a>, who face each other on Friday night, and that’s the moment that comes to his mind. The 1978 final. Ticker tape, Mario Kempes and, clearest of all, Rob Rensenbrink hitting the post. “I watched with ‘long teeth’, envy,” he admits.</p><p>He was missing out on Argentina winning their first World Cup; he couldn’t know it then, but he wouldn’t miss out on the second. Thirty-six years on from Mexico 86, Valdano would love a third, a spectator again but in the stadium, not some bar. “I asked [the coach César Luis] Menotti. He said if the World Cup started that day, I’d be in the squad. ‘What I can’t promise,’ he said, ‘is that I’ll be coach tomorrow, given this chaos.’</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/08/jorge-valdano-interview-argentina-world-cup-messi-happiness-liberated">Continue reading...</a>

Sculptor whose largely abstract work drew on natural forms<p>Charlotte Mayer, who has died aged 93, belonged to the generation of Central European Jews who went to Britain as refugees from the Nazis and subsequently made a vital contribution to the country’s cultural life. Memories of the Holocaust, and especially of the murder of her maternal grandmother, Ružena, were translated by Mayer into the jagged, disturbing sculpture <a href="https://www.pangolinlondon.com/artists/40-charlotte-mayer/works/5677-charlotte-mayer-the-thornflower-2006/" title="">Thornflower</a> (2006). Yet even there, the spines at the heart of the composition are combined with more comforting organic shapes, as if to represent life’s “duality”, as Mayer herself put it.</p><p>The fact that this curving, floral imagery also has more than a passing resemblance to apple peel is not accidental. Mayer’s use of such natural forms and, sometimes, materials drew heavily on her childhood experiences in Prague, at her grandparents’ home Das Rosel Haus (The House of Roses). Although this villa functioned as a kind of salon for the city’s artists, Mayer herself recalled most vividly deshelling walnuts and making little baskets from horse chestnuts with the housekeeper, Máde.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/dec/08/charlotte-mayer-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

Russian delegate Denis Rebrikov responded by saying the subject should be outside the scope of the biodiversity summit. “It’s hard to avoid the impression that these countries are deliberately trying to sabotage the adoption of a global framework,” he said.</p><p>It’s currently 3C in Montreal and some delegates are struggling with the cold.

They are ruthlessly torn apart in Gelsenkirchen by the brilliant Johan Cruyff-inspired <em>Oranje</em>, whose collective vision, movement and passing patterns are complemented by steely tackling and defensive discipline. Cruyff dances around the goalkeeper Daniel Carnevali to roll in the first after latching on to Johan Neeskens’s chipped pass; it is the defender Wim Rijsbergen’s crunching challenge that sets the platform for the attack. Ruud Krol soon rockets in the second from the edge of the area after a corner. In the second half, Cruyff whips an immaculate cross to the far post where Johnny Rep’s bullet header makes it 3-0. On the sidelines, the Netherlands manager, Rinus Michels, laughs, claps and rubs his hands with glee. In the last minute, after yet another fluent passing move, Willem van Hanegem’s close-range shot is beaten out by Carnevali, only for Cruyff to audaciously volley in from an angle. For a proud footballing nation such as Argentina it is particularly painful to be taught a lesson in such emphatic fashion.

He talks about how he became a donkey whisperer to get the best performance, his career as a painter and playing a villain in The Avengers</p><p>In his rolling, sonorous, Polish-accented English, veteran director Jerzy Skolimowski explains how he became a donkey whisperer. “I make a very close bond with the animal,” he says. “Every time I was not doing anything else, I sit with donkey. I look very closely at him, eye to eye. I speak to donkey, talking in his ears gently. All my free time I spent with donkey.” There is a reason for describing this inter-species bonding: Skolimowski is about to release his amazing new film that features a donkey as the main – indeed, only significant – character; its title is simply<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19652910/"> EO</a>, designed to imitate a donkey’s bray.</p><p>Skolimowski, 84, obliges – “Ee-oh! Ee-oh!” – but seems unaware of the full extent of donkey-related sentiment that will undoubtedly be rolling his film’s way, in the UK at least. He and his wife – EO’s co-writer and producer Ewa Piaskowska – might know a little about the British adoration for donkeys, but they may be unaware that <a href="https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id=uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=2&amp;p_p_state=maximized&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_resource_id=%2Faccounts-resource&amp;p_p_cacheability=cacheLevelPage&amp;_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId=A12367023&amp;_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName=%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns&amp;_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber=264818">£60m (mostly in wills) was given to the Donkey Sanctuary in Devon last year</a>.

<p>Their album As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt 2 kicked-started the mashup phenomenon. As they prepare for an anniversary concert, the Dewaele brothers discuss bootlegs, brotherhood and looking back </p><p>In 2002, Belgian duo Stephen and David Dewaele released a mix album called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/treisiunsfert/2-many-djs-as-heard-on-radio">As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt 2</a> under the name <a href="https://www.2manydjs.com/">2ManyDJs</a>. It sold half a million copies, and its playful, hectic variety spoke to people who were equally excited by Daft Punk and the Velvet Underground, garage rock and electroclash. In many clubs, though, there was some initial resistance. “Half the people were like: ‘We’re here for house music, what are you playing?’” Stephen remembers. “A quarter were like: ‘OK, I’ll go with it.’ And 10% were like: ‘Oh my God, you played the Stooges!’ Those were the people we were doing it for. Gradually that room shifted to everyone going: ‘Give us the Stooges!’ The world had turned upside down.”</p><p>This month, as the album comes to streaming platforms for the first time, the brothers are throwing a 20th anniversary party at Brixton Academy, London, where they will play a souped-up audiovisual version of the mix.<strong> </strong>“We took a lot of convincing,” says David. “It’s not in our nature to look back. But that particular record still sounds fresh because we didn’t really know what we were doing. If listening to old records is like looking at old pictures of yourself, this is different. It’s like looking at a picture of yourself but you had no idea there was a camera. It was just us messing around.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/08/2manydjs-on-20-accidental-years-of-mashups-and-mayhem-its-more-fun-when-its-a-little-bit-naughty">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’ve been a Meghann Fahy fan for years! You think you can just waltz in now and claim to be one too? </p><p>There is something that is guaranteed to happen if an Australian sporting team begins to perform well in an international event like the World Cup, as we saw recently. I’m not talking about politicians putting on merch and Googling “soccer” in order to pretend they like sport, although that’s also true. It’s that with each passing match, more and more people will get excited and begin to join in on the action, tuning in to give their support. This, in turn, will cause some others to become irritated, as they start to accuse people of “jumping on the bandwagon” and not being “real” fans.</p><p>Of course, this is not limited to sport – accusations of bandwagoning are thrown around when musicians begin to get more popular, or when TV shows are discovered late. It is a complaint that has always annoyed me, and I’ve found it difficult to understand. Everyone is a new fan at some point! So were you – unless you had a flat screen TV set up in your mother’s uterus where you could watch your favourite team play before you were birthed.

<p>The mass-scale removal of resources is a key driver of biodiversity loss. Extractivism’s grip on the planet must be broken</p><p>At the biodiversity Cop taking place in Montreal, much attention will focus on a policy proposal calling for 30% of the planet’s land and oceans to be protected by 2030, known as 30x30. Protected areas have their place in addressing the biodiversity crisis, but we also know that they are insufficient. Since the 1970s, they have increased <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/conl.12748">fourfold</a> globally, expanding to about 17% of the planet, but extraction rates have more than <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/worldwide-extraction-materials-triples-four-decades-intensifying">tripled</a>. This unrelenting expansion of forestry, mining, monoculture farming and fossil fuel developments is a <a href="https://ipbes.net/global-assessment">central driver</a> of biodiversity loss. Ending or at least reducing “extractivism” must be front and centre at Cop15.</p><p>Extractivism is more than extraction. Extraction is the not inherently damaging removal of matter from nature and its transformation into things useful to humans. <a href="https://www.tni.org/files/download/beyonddevelopment_extractivism.pdf">Extractivism</a>, a term born of anti-colonial struggle and thought in the Americas, is a mode of accumulation based on hyper-extraction with lopsided benefits and costs: concentrated mass-scale removal of resources primarily for export, with benefits largely accumulating far from the sites of extraction. One <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095937802200005X">estimate</a> puts the drain south to north at a staggering $10tn (£8tn) a year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/08/extractivism-is-destroying-nature-to-tackle-it-cop15-must-go-beyond-simple-targets">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Although there are sweet moments alongside the vomit-inducing, the overriding message of this royal documentary is: the late Queen was right to keep stumm</p><p>Well, it’s Christmas for Netflix all right. The first gobbet of “educational or entertainment” material that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are contracted to create as part of their £112m deal with the streaming platform has been delivered. Six episodes of Harry &amp; Meghan, an up-close-and-personal documentary of their life together have been made. Divided into two “volumes” of three, the first volume has now dropped. Like a turd into a stocking, may be the royal family’s feeling – but for the rest of us it is entertainment, and indeed an education of sorts. Mainly in how right the late Queen was to keep stumm for her entire 70-year reign.</p><p>The Sussexes have clearly suffered, in ways most of us will not experience. Whether they have suffered quite as much as they think is another question. At one point, Harry says in wonder that his wife first sacrificed everything for him – by leaving her life in the US and joining him and the royal family in England – and then he in turn sacrificed everything for her by leaving the royal family and joining her in the US. Which is entirely true and yet not at all true at the same time. A feeling that persists throughout the three hours of insight/non-insight we have been gifted so far.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/08/harry-and-meghan-netflix-review-so-sickening-i-almost-brought-up-my-breakfast">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Top Dawg Entertainment/RCA)</strong><br />The US star’s follow-up to her groundbreaking debut ranges wildly, from pop-punk to traces of Radiohead and a Phoebe Bridgers feature. You’d give it a trim were the quality not so unerringly high</p><p>Last week, SZA released the cover of her second album, SOS. A photo of her perched on a long diving board in the middle of the ocean, it turned into a global news story, reported everywhere from the <a href="https://www.nhl.com/news/sza-rocks-st-louis-blues-jersey-on-new-album-cover/c-338235378">website of the National Hockey League</a>, which approved of the St Louis Blues jersey she was wearing, to the Daily Mail, which reacted very much as you might expect the Daily Mail to react when a Black artist appears in a photo apparently modelled on a paparazzo shot of Diana, Princess of Wales, taken days before her death.</p><p>If it all seemed a bit overheated, perhaps SZA’s second album was always bound to attract attention regardless of its sleeve, and not merely because it follows <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/11/sza-ctrl-review">Ctrl</a>, one of the most acclaimed debuts of the 2010s. That album announced the arrival of an artist willing to push at the boundaries of R&amp;B: defiantly experimental, it sold 3m copies in the US alone. It’s that SOS has been a very long time coming. Its lead single, Good Days, was released two years ago. A second, I Hate U, appeared on SoundCloud in the summer of 2021, apparently on the say-so of SZA’s astrologer. Potential release dates came and went. In May, she announced the album was “ready to go”, promising “a SZA summer”. Two months later, she suggested her label was withholding the album against her wishes, but more recently claimed to be “stressed” about meeting even a December deadline. Moreover, she keeps hinting that the album will be her last. She is “emotionally, energetically unequipped” for fame: “I could burst into tears … I am effectively falling apart,” she told a journalist last month, which hardly bodes well for the rest of the promotional cycle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/08/sza-sos-review-top-dawg-entertainment-rca">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After painful 2014 World Cup semi-final the manager wants relatively callow squad to puff out their chests in latest clash</p><p>On a gristly, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/09/argentina-holland-world-cup-semi-final-match-report">awkward night in São Paulo</a> eight years ago Louis van Gaal could pick from a list of regrets. There was the fact Lionel Messi had been rationed to scraps in a game almost bereft of clear chances; he could reflect that, when one did arrive, Javier Mascherano slid in with Arjen Robben poised to score; then came a shootout and, with it, the kicker. Van Gaal had made all his substitutions by the time penalties seemed nailed on and could not bring on Tim Krul, who had successfully been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/06/louis-van-gaal-tim-krul-holland-costa-rica-world-cup">deployed for exactly that</a> purpose against Costa Rica. Instead Jasper Cillessen was powerless to prevent Argentina scoring four times while Ron Vlaar and Wesley Sneijder fluffed their lines. A place in the final slipped away. “I don’t like to think about it,” Van Gaal admitted this week.</p><p>It means the Netherlands’ most recent memory of a glittering, glorious fixture is that of an achingly painful slog but Van Gaal has a chance to send those demons packing on Friday. Moreover, he does not mind who knows it. “We have a score to settle,” he said after both teams had passed their last-16 assignments. The statement was typically brusque and perhaps an insight into the reasons why the 71-year-old agreed to return for a third tenure last year. He will be replaced by Ronald Koeman in 2023: this is one last crack at the ultimate prize and the sense is he sees no value in playing things down.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/08/van-gaal-netherlands-argentina-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Black Americans spend billions on domestic travel, but very few hotels are Black-owned. Here are some to support</p><p>Black travelers make up a robust segment of the US tourism economy. According to a 2019 <a href="https://www.mmgyglobal.com/news/black-u-s-leisure-travelers-spent-109-4-billion-on-travel-in-2019-according-to-new-report/">study</a> conducted by market research firm MMGY Global, Black Americans spent $109.4bn on domestic travel in 2019 – plus nearly $20bn more on travel abroad. That’s over 13% of the overall US leisure travel market, roughly the same percentage of Black people in the US. “What’s often perceived to be a ‘niche’ audience actually accounts for over 458m traveler stays each year,” says Chris Davidson, executive vice president of MMGY.</p><p>These healthy numbers don’t square with the travel industry’s entrenched problem of Black equity. While a number of hotels were founded by Black people in the half century following Emancipation – from the Wormley Hotel in Washington DC and the recently shuttered Eureka Inn in Jonesborough, Tennessee to the Julian Gold Rush Hotel, which still operating in the former mining town of Julian, California, the Black stake in the US travel economy is far from flourishing. According to the National Association of Black Hotel Owners, Operators and Developers, a mere 2% of US hotels are under Black ownership. Which means that travel dollars – no matter their source – rarely wind up in Black hands.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/08/us-travel-industry-racial-equity-problem-black-hotels">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Known for his arch humour, the comedian Tom Allen paints a moving portrait of his father and their relationship</p><p>When Tom Allen’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/nov/12/tom-allen-bake-off-extra-slice-interview-comedian-memoir-no-shame-homophobic" title="">first memoir, No Shame</a>, was published in 2020, he was 37, permanently single and living at home with his parents in Bromley. Two years on, circumstances have changed. Allen has a boyfriend and a house of his own, minutes away from the family home, but his dad died suddenly at the end of 2021. Too Much is his attempt to face that loss, come to terms with their imperfect relationship and learn how to be an adult now his much-loved role model is gone. Fans of his arch and cutting comedy might be surprised to find that the book is heartfelt, vulnerable and touchingly sincere.</p><p>Allen proceeds one snapshot at a time, each chapter opening with an aphorism from his dad. They include: “You can never have too much love”; “If you can’t improve on silence, keep your mouth shut”; “The world takes you at your own valuation”; and the baffling but catchy “It’s cold enough for a handbag”. Familial love glows from the page – not glibly, waving jazz hands, but gently and steadfastly, with each act of kindness and moment of exasperation. They show they care “by bickering senselessly over weatherproof cushions”. Bleeding radiators takes on a poignance that’s almost unbearable. This is the kind of parenting that doesn’t get written about in books.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/08/too-much-by-tom-allen-review-life-after-losing-dad">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I know its word of the year was put to a public vote, but the result smacks of a stunt trying too hard to go viral</p><p>Society has fallen. The nuclear alarm sounds. Fires rage across the face of the Earth as devastation is wreaked by earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis. A fleet of aliens has landed, from a distant and, apparently, far more evolved corner of the solar system. They understand not only our languages, but our thoughts. They roam our cities, huge tentacled beasts with endless teeth and eyes. All seeing, all knowing.</p><p>But they’re only the penultimate stage of a long coming decline. Society had already evolved itself out of fertility. Thanks to pollution, or an act of God. Who can say? The end, it seems, is in sight. And then, worst of it all: news reaches me, in my underground concrete bunker, that the Oxford English Dictionary has decided, after a public vote, that its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/dec/05/goblin-mode-new-oxford-word-of-the-year">word of the year will be “goblin mode”</a>.

<p>I have more stuff than I want, need or have room for. But still I cling on to that trouser press my dad gave me many years ago</p><p>Martin Lewis, the moneysaving expert and possibly the country’s most influential person right now, has had something to say about present-giving. Mindful of the cost of living crisis, he’s calling for us to sign up to what he’s calling pre-nups. Here Nups is an acronym for No Unnecessary Presents. As he puts it: “The best gift is the gift of releasing people from the obligation of having to buy for you.”</p><p>He’s undoubtedly right, but not in the case of those people who don’t want to be released from the obligation of buying presents. In my experience, there are many who feel this way. Giving is often more about the giver than the receiver, in that they will get more gratification from giving the gift than the giftee will get upon tearing open the wrapping paper.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/08/so-many-unwanted-christmas-gifts-remain-gathering-dust-but-binning-them-just-fills-me-with-guilt">Continue reading...</a>

The 30-year-old Catalan singer and producer, born Rosalía Vila Tobella, had spent four years working her way to the centre of the Latin pop world. Now she headed into the audience and started grinding on her boyfriend, the Puerto Rican singer Rauw Alejandro. Within seconds, clips of the moment were all over TikTok.

Rail workers deserve a fair deal, but it is not fair to let the trade unions undermine the livelihoods of others.”</p><p>We do have some areas where strikes are not allowed as part of the contract. So, for example, the military can’t go on strike and the police. There’s some people … as a matter of public safety, you can’t go on strike.</p><p>And what we’re looking at is, are there other areas that we should include in that?

<p>Family life is fraught with suspicion, sexual tension and betrayal in this early novel, translated into English for the first time</p><p>Marguerite Duras was a literary phenomenon. To scroll through her bibliography is to pull up a mass of novels, stories, plays, screenplays, in a creative lifespan from 1943 until her death in 1996. In The Easy Life, the first English translation of her second novel, published in France in 1944, the quintessential Duras tone is already here – stripped-down staccato sentences, remorseless introspection.</p><p>Duras is best known today for The Lover, a novel written when she was 70; a fictional version of her own youthful love affair in French Indochina (today’s Vietnam) with a Chinese Vietnamese man, it won the Prix Goncourt and was made into a successful film. Duras often plundered her own life for subject matter: in The Easy Life she turns to the remote village in south-east France from which her father had come and which she had visited as a teenager.

<p>Draw the curtains, pull up your weighted blanket and hunker down with these cosy sims, expansive fantasies or, for actual goblins, subterranean dungeon crawlers</p><p>Earlier this week, “goblin mode” was announced as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/dec/05/goblin-mode-new-oxford-word-of-the-year">Oxford’s word of the year</a>, bringing a new level of awareness – and hopefully acceptance – to this previously misunderstood and maligned lifestyle choice. It is defined as “a type of behaviour which is unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, slovenly, or greedy, typically in a way that rejects social norms or expectations” (also known, throughout lockdown, as simply “existing”), though the exact parameters of the term have been much discussed. But one thing is certain: video games are the perfect goblin mode entertainment. They can be enjoyed from bed, they require little energy and yet they simulate a lot of real-world activities so you can at least pretend to be a functioning member of the human race.</p><p>But not all games are suitable for goblin mode. Pokémon Go is an absolute no-go (you have to go outside) as are Just Dance (you have to stand up) and driving sims such as Gran Turismo 7 (waaaaay too intense). It is important to play games that complement your slovenly state of mind. Here, then, are some perfect picks for those dank, dungeon-dwelling days of duvet exile.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/dec/08/best-video-games-to-play-in-goblin-mode">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The reluctant superstar hasn’t scored but has made more key passes than anyone to make his team run more smoothly</p><p>“At least he’s not tired,” Didier Deschamps observed sardonically. It was September and Antoine Griezmann was in the latest circle of a recurring nightmare. Back at Atlético Madrid on loan after a gruesome two seasons at Barcelona, Griezmann found himself in the surreal position of being allowed to play only 30 minutes per game, lest an automatic buy clause in his deal be triggered. And so for several weeks, despite being fully fit, Griezmann would watch from the bench, before being wheeled out as a substitute on the hour mark.</p><p>Still, you could rely on the France manager to put a positive spin on things. Of all the stalwarts of the Deschamps era, it is Griezmann with whom he seems to have the closest bond of all, an almost paternal connection that has held firm through the toughest of times. Even as Griezmann withered away at Barcelona, even as he languished on the bench in Madrid, even when it seemed as though the peak years of this extraordinary footballer were winnowing away, Deschamps’ faith in his talismanic forward never wavered. Now, in their third World Cup together, we are seeing the results.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/08/antoine-griezmann-greases-the-wheels-to-get-best-out-of-france">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Alexandria to Oxford, a kaleidoscopic history of the written word</p><p>What do you give the queen who has everything? When Mark Antony was wondering how to impress Cleopatra in the run-up to the battle of Actium in 31BC, he knew that jewellery would hardly cut it. The queen of the Ptolemaic kingdom of Egypt had recently dissolved a giant pearl in vinegar and then proceeded to drink it, just because she could. In the face of such exhausted materialism, the Roman general knew that he would have to pull out the stops if he was to win over the woman with whom he was madly in love. So he arrived bearing 200,000 scrolls for the great library at Alexandria.</p><p>On a logistical level this worked well: since the library was the biggest storehouse of books in the world, Cleopatra almost certainly had the shelf space. As a romantic gesture, it was equally provocative. Within weeks the middle-aged lovers were embarked on the final chapter of their erotic misadventure, the one which would mark the beginning of the end both for them and for Alexandria’s fabled library.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/08/papyrus-by-irene-vallejo-review-how-books-built-the-world">Continue reading...</a>

The father stalled for a moment. They’d already had too much sugary stuff that day, he said. “But it’s sugar-free,” replied one of the boys. That sealed the deal. The boys walked off happily into the cinema holding their drinks.</p><p>In an era when sugar is widely seen as enemy No 1, sugar-free drinks and treats, sweetened with low-calorie additives, promise guilt-free sweetness. Some people deliberately choose low-sugar options in the hope of losing weight or managing diabetes; others just enjoy the taste. But even if you aren’t seeking them out, it’s hard to avoid artificial sweeteners. In 2021, researchers looked at foods for sale in Hong Kong and found that sweeteners were present not just in products where you would expect them, such as sugarless chewing gum, but also in salad dressings, breads, instant noodles and many crisps. Sweeteners have become such a common part of our diet that environmental scientists have started looking for traces of them – particularly acesulfame potassium], which passes through the body largely undigested – as a marker for human waste in lakes and rivers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/08/artificial-sweeteners-price-of-sugar-free-are-they-as-harmless-as-we-thought">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A resistance workout is not just about adding muscle: it can bring a host of other proven benefits as well. So what is stopping you? </p><p>‘I got obsessed with watching Olympic weightlifting during London 2012,” says Fiona Clements, a software developer working in London. “I think it’s partly because the effort is so visible – you can see every flicker of doubt, pain and triumph on the athletes’ faces. I was 48 at the time. I thought I’d left it far too late to even consider trying it, but then I kept thinking about it. It took until September 2022, but I finally went for it.” Now 58, Clements can deadlift 50kg and push 21kg overhead. She says she has never felt stronger.</p><p>Resistance training, to use the catch-all term for any sort of exercise where you’re working against weight, whether it’s using dumbbells, exercise bands or just your own body weight, has a lot to recommend it. It makes you stronger and more injury-resistant by increasing bone density and strengthening the muscles, ligaments and tendons around your joints. It mitigates the risk of everything from falls to osteoporosis as you age. It can burn calories and reduce body fat more efficiently than cardio, by keeping your metabolism elevated for days after each workout. Plus, it’s more effective for flexibility than certain styles of stretching.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/08/strengthen-your-heart-bones-and-maybe-even-your-brain-a-beginners-guide-to-weight-training-at-any-age">Continue reading...</a>
