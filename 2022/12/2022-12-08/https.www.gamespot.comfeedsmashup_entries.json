While the company has not explicitly required working overtime, Blizzard has offered a variety of incentives to keep employees at their desks. These range from $25 Door Dash credit for employees who work over 10 hours a day to gaining company stock shares after the game ships.</p><p>These incentives have not been enough to keep all employees at the company, however. The Diablo 4 team has reportedly been consistently losing developers. One 20-person team lost half of its members over a year. Former employees interviewed by the Post alleged that when they asked for raises, some managers suggested they quit the company to look for a higher wage elsewhere, and only return to Blizzard when they have more experience. Many of the employees who do leave have multiple years of experience, while their replacements are inexperienced, entry-level hires. As a result of these issues, many quoted employees seem to doubt that the game will release in a completed state come June.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-development-mired-in-crunch-and-poor-leadership-according-to-new-report/1100-6509862/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-introduces-new-xxs-and-xxl-pokemon-variants/1100-6509653/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Pokemon Go Introduces New XXS And XXL Pokemon Variants", "date_published": "2022-12-08 20:39:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Pokemon Go players will soon have another way to catch unique Pokemon, as Niantic has announced the addition of XXS and XXL Pokemon to the mix.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The two new Pokemon sizes will be featured with three Pokemon to begin with: Poochyena, Mightyena, and Mawile.

With that growth, Disney is looking to shake things up, offering a new tier of the service which is ad supported. It's not actually a money-saving option, however.

So what is this new ad supported tier, how much does it cost, and what else do you need to know about it?</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Price:</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Disney+ with ads costs $8 a month. If you don't want ads, there is a little bit of a price hike, as the ad-free experience will cost $11 a month. Prior to the launch of Disney+ with ads, the service cost $8 a month, so users who have been paying the same amount for months with their ad-free Disney+ experience will now have to pay extra to avoid the newly-added advertisements.

Ramattra is an Omnic leader, one who is afraid to use violence to protect his people. As a tank, Ramattra can switch forms depending on the situation, making him a flexible pick for most game modes.

In this form Ramattra has the ability to create temporary shields and has access to his long-range weapon, the Void Accelerator. This weapon fires weak projectiles in a tight pattern over long distances. He can use ability to switch into his Nemesis form, where he has increased armor and access to his Pummel attack, which fires short range punch blasts. In this form Ramattra can also block his face, which reduces the amount of damage he takes from attacks to his front side. His ultimate ability puts him in Nemesis mode and creates a field around him, tethering enemies and dealing damage to them. As long as someone is taking damage, the ultimate will continue.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Ramattra abilities</h2><figure style=\"width: 1920px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4073978-ramattra2.jpg\"><img alt=\"Ramattra's Nemesis mode temporarily makes him a close-quarters threat.\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1599/15997278/4073978-ramattra2.jpg\" /></a><figcaption>Ramattra's Nemesis mode temporarily makes him a close-quarters threat.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Void Accelerator (Omnic): </strong>Fire a stream of projectiles.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-ramattra-hero-guide/1100-6509852/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-ftc-is-now-suing-microsoft-over-pending-activision-blizzard-merger/1100-6509849/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "The FTC Is Now Suing Microsoft Over Pending Activision Blizzard Merger", "date_published": "2022-12-08 19:31:00+00:00", "description": "<p>The Federal Trade Commission has <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/12/ftc-seeks-block-microsoft-corps-acquisition-activision-blizzard-inc\">officially sued</a> Microsoft in an attempt to stop the company's $69 billion acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard.

dir=\"ltr\">The long-rumored Rush Hour 4 is still very much a possibility, star Jackie Chan revealed at the Red Sea International Film Festival in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. According to <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2022/12/jackie-chan-says-rush-hour-4-is-in-the-works-red-sea-film-festival-1235193279/\">Deadline</a>, Chan told a festival crowd in an on-stage appearance that \"we're talking about Rush Hour 4 [happening] right now.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Chan didn't reveal who might direct the next film in the franchise, but Brett Ratner directed all three previous entries. Ratner stepping in to direct would be significant, both because he hasn't helmed a movie since 2014--and also because in 2017, during the Me Too movement, six women, including Olivia Munn and Natasha Henstridge, accused Ratner of sexual assault and harassment. Warner Bros. subsequently cut all ties with the producer-director.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Chan and Chris Tucker play mismatched police officers in the Rush Hour series. The first movie came out in 1998, with sequels following in 2001 and 2007. At the festival, Chan recalls how he was first drafted into the film series, initially thinking Rush Hour would flop. \"I got a phone call [after the first movie debuted],\" Chan said, \"Brett Ratner and Chris Tucker call me from New York. They're crazy. We were $70 million in the first weekend.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rush-hour-4-is-happening/1100-6509851/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-forge-map-turns-waffle-house-into-a-late-night-battleground/1100-6509850/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Halo Infinite Forge Map Turns Waffle House Into A Late-Night Battleground", "date_published": "2022-12-08 18:42:00+00:00", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/\">Halo Infinite</a> custom map creators continue to impress, as your local Waffle House is now a late-night battleground thanks to the power of the game's Forge toolset.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As shared by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1600579765257256996?s=20&amp;t=ArVKAH52c3lyfciepFccaA\">Rebs Gaming</a> on Twitter, someone has lovingly recreated a Waffle House in Halo Infinite using Forge.

Meanwhile, PDP's Victrix brand just released a modular controller called the Victrix Pro BFG for $180. Though it remains to be seen how the Wolverine V2 Pro stacks up against the DualSense Edge, I also took a look at PDP's officially licensed controller, so make sure to check out our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/victrix-pro-bfg-ps5-controller-review-ultimate-versatility/1100-6509840/\">Victrix Pro BFG review</a>, too.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Is that a mouse in your hands?</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">If you're unfamiliar with Razer's Wolverine line, the series is novel in its approach to button design. Mimicking the sound and feedback of a Razer gaming mouse, the face buttons, D-pad, and shoulder buttons use \"mecha-tactile\" switches to decrease response time, allowing you to trigger inputs faster. In addition to helping give you the edge in competitive multiplayer games, the switches simply feel better than ordinary controller inputs. To me, they are vastly superior, in fact, though there are people who don't like the sound or feel.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-wolverine-v2-pro-review-pricey-and-niche/1100-6509839/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/victrix-pro-bfg-ps5-controller-review-ultimate-versatility/1100-6509840/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Victrix Pro BFG PS5 Controller Review - Ultimate Versatility", "date_published": "2022-12-08 18:21:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">More than two years after the PlayStation 5\u2019s release, there are finally other controller options other than the DualSense.

It has all of those essential boxes checked, but it has far more customization features than you\u2019d expect from most controllers\u2013even high-end ones in this price range.

According to Thordansmash, each player's Common-tier body shield will stay common for the duration of the match, as the mode allegedly removes the EVO mechanic, along with all Rare, Epic, and Legendary shields. (The same presumably goes for helmets as well.) The only gold items on the field will be hop-ups like the Turbocharger. Additionally, players will have access to fewer health items. Though it's currently unclear how exactly this will be implemented, it likely means healing items will spawn less often, or players will be unable to carry as many of them as usual.</p><p>Legend abilities appear unchanged, but when it comes to weaponry, Thordansmash claims the new LTM contains no gold loot whatsoever, with the exception of hop-ups. Ammo spawns less frequently in this mode, but according to the dataminer, bullets will do more damage in this new mode than they do in standard matches.

NFL Blitz Legends is an awesome throwback with a solid build that'd be a nice addition to any game room.</p><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"6509832 - NFL Blitz Legends Review\">    <div class=\"buylink__container\">                                                                                                                                                                                               <div class=\"buylink__item\">                  <div class=\"buylink__image-container clickable\">                                            <img alt=\"\" class=\"buylink__image\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4073736-nflblitz.jpeg\" />                                 <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/arcade1up-nfl-blitz-arcade-console/6511265.p?skuId=6511265&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=__ARTICLE_NAME__&amp;article_url=__ARTICLE_URL__&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value\"></a>                              </div>                   <div class=\"buylink__text\">                      <p class=\"buylink__title text-bold\">                        <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/arcade1up-nfl-blitz-arcade-console/6511265.p?skuId=6511265&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=__ARTICLE_NAME__&amp;article_url=__ARTICLE_URL__&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value\">Arcade1Up NFL Blitz Legends</a>           </p>                                                       <p class=\"buylink__deck\">                          <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/arcade1up-nfl-blitz-arcade-console/6511265.p?skuId=6511265&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=__ARTICLE_NAME__&amp;article_url=__ARTICLE_URL__&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value\">Save $100 for a limited time</a>             </p>                                              </div>                  <div class=\"buylink__links\">                                                                                                                                                          <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/arcade1up-nfl-blitz-arcade-console/6511265.p?skuId=6511265&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=__ARTICLE_NAME__&amp;article_url=__ARTICLE_URL__&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value\">See at Best Buy</a>                     </div>                         </div>                     </div> </div><p dir=\"ltr\">Similar to Arcade1Up's NBA Jam cabinets, NFL Blitz Legends supports up to four players locally. It has a wider control deck that extends a fair amount beyond the width of the cabinet itself. This means that it does take up more space than the average Arcade1Up cabinet, despite having similar cabinet dimensions as the manufacturer's other three-quarter scale machines, including the familiar 17-inch display. That said, you will have to scrunch up very close to your buddies if four people are playing. It's more comfortable as a two-player machine, and it's also just more fun to have total control over your team instead of splitting it with someone else. Still, the option for four is there, which is a neat bonus so more people can play at the same time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Each player has three action buttons: jump/tackle, pass/change player on defense, and turbo--as well as a start button. If you have experience with Arcade1Up's other cabinets, these buttons will be familiar. They get the job done and feel pretty good, especially when you consider the price point.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcade1up-nfl-blitz-legends-review-a-timeless-classic-reborn/1100-6509832/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-dark-tower-adaption-back-at-amazon-with-mike-flanagan-and-trevor-macy-at-the-helm/1100-6509834/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "The Dark Tower Adaption Back At Amazon With Mike Flanagan And Trevor Macy At The Helm", "date_published": "2022-12-08 15:28:00+00:00", "description": "<p>It's been an interesting week for Mike Flanagan and his partner Trevor Macy.

In 2022, those ideas gave birth to a rich tapestry of fantasy, sci-fi, and superhero action that set the charts ablaze. There was no shortage of engrossing role-playing games to play on consoles and PC this year, which was certainly welcome during yet another year where escapist entertainment proved to be a great distraction.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Elden Ring is obviously the biggest and most mainstream example here, as From Software's grim and dark sandbox earned rave reviews on launch day and has been a monumental success in the sales department as well. Popular and critically acclaimed, Elden Ring still faced some stiff competition from a number of other great games available in the RPG space this year. For a more intimate experience, indie RPGs were an amazing exploration of alternate themes and experimental ideas.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is a surprisingly tender look at life and love when charting the stars for example, and on the more established side, Atelier Sophie 2: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream from Koei Tecmo is a delightfully cathartic romp through familiar territory. Remakes of cult-classics also arrived this year, shining a spotlight on forgotten gems from yesteryear. This year also brought an interesting departure from the norm for one of the biggest RPG franchises on the planet: Pokemon. Game Freak's Pokemon Legends: Arceus reinvigorated the long-running series with fresh ideas.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To find the best RPGs of the year, we crunched the numbers from GameSpot's sister site Metacritic and listed the best of the magical best below.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Elden Ring</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4072911-eldenring%285%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Though everyone starts out as a Tarnished punching bag in the opening minutes of Elden Ring, it's not long before the game opens up and introduces you to a rich selection of roles in which to define your journey through From Software's masterpiece. From Bandit and Astrologer to Vagabond and Samurai, Elden Ring's flexible system of choice is amplified by an absurd amount of additional content that makes inhabiting its staggeringly massive world that much more fascinating. Elegant, dangerous, and constantly exciting, there's never a dull moment in one of the best games of the year.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/elden-ring\">Metascore: 96</a> | Read our<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-review-death-of-the-wild/1900-6417832/\"> Elden Ring review</a></p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/elden-ring-xbox-one-xbox-series-x/6352382.p?skuId=6352382&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=__ARTICLE_NAME__&amp;article_url=__ARTICLE_URL__&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value\">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4072912-thelegendofheroestrailsfromzero.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">A number of old school games have made 2022 a delight for retro fans, and with The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero, this is the classic cherry on top of a nostalgic sundae.

Take that idea, sprinkle in the growing pains of puberty, toss in teenage romance, and serve it up in a bowl of cosmic worldbuilding, and you've got I Was a Teenage Exocolonist. A narrative deckbuilding RPG, I Was a Teenage Exocolonist follows you through the 10 most important years of your protagonist's life as you find danger, romance, and heartbreak amongst the stars. With multiple playthroughs, striking art direction, and dozens of endings, Northway Games' galactic odyssey is both epic in scale and tender in its more nuanced moments.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/i-was-a-teenage-exocolonist\">Metascore: 89</a> </p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1148760/I_Was_a_Teenage_Exocolonist/\">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Pentiment</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4072915-pentiment.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Stepping into a beautifully realized world of intricate art and complex manuscripts is an easy sell, but throwing in cleverly approachable systems and RPG ideas seals the deal on this masterpiece from Obsidian Entertainment. Pentiment is a game of humble beginnings and a strong creative vision within the confines of 16th century paintings and illustrations.

It's a fantastic mix of ambitious story ideas, novel gameplay elements, and graphics that were groundbreaking for its time, capped off with an elegant soundtrack that has stood the test of time. Fast forward to 2022, and Square Enix rolled out a vibrant pixel remaster of the game that courted some controversy with its font, but still proved to be an essential adventure for any RPG fan.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/final-fantasy-vi-pixel-remaster\">Metascore: 88</a> </p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1173820/FINAL_FANTASY_VI/\">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Tactics Ogre: Reborn</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4072918-tacticsogrereborn%281%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Technically, Tactics Ogre: Reborn is an updated version of the 2010 remake of 1995's Tactics Ogre, but one that gives the underrated classic a much wider audience with its rollout on PC and console. As deep with its rich gameplay systems and memorable cast of characters as it was all the way back in 1995, Tactics Ogre Reborn is a thoughtful remaster of a remake.

It has a grandiose story, warring kingdoms, and no shortage of characters who find themselves embroiled in political machinations. But that's just surface dressing for the game that lies beneath that fantasy setup, as Triangle Strategy is an approachable game that streamlines classic tactical-RPG systems and makes every battlefield decision carry substantial weight.

It's a rock-solid RPG with turn-based combat that is pure fantasy comfort food. It also excels at providing heartwarming and whimsical content.

The Megazord was incredibly rad--combining five Zords into one, giant robot. And the Megazord remained pretty good for a bit, up until the Dragonzord made its debut, which was later revealed to be the Green Ranger's Zord--which was later revealed to be Tommy, played by the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/power-rangers-star-jason-david-frank-dies-at-49-tributes-pour-in-from-around-the-world/1100-6509340/\">late Jason David Frank</a>. At first, the Dragonzord couldn't combine with the other Zords. It was just a badass robot that fired missiles from its fingers. But people still loved it.</p><p>As the show progressed, we saw it combine with the other Zords--once Tommy was released from Rita Repulsa's evil spell--and everything about the Dragonzord is just great. And now, it's available in toy form. Hasbro recently released the <a href=\"https://hasbropulse.com/collections/lightning-collection/products/power-rangers-lightning-collection-zord-ascension-project-mighty-morphin-dragonzord\">Power Rangers Lightning Collection Zord Ascension Project Mighty Morphin Dragonzord at Hasbro Pulse</a>. Yes, that's a mouthful. Coming in at $132, this is a pricey toy, but it does so much--especially when you already own the Lightning Collection Megazord. Hasbro sent us the Dragonzord, so we're checking it out.</p><p>Additionally, Hasbro sent us the <a href=\"https://hasbropulse.com/collections/lightning-collection/products/power-rangers-lightning-collection-mighty-morphin-blue-ranger-power-lance\">Lightning Collection Mighty Morphin Blue Ranger Power Lance</a>, and you can <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-green-rangers-new-dragonzord-toy-puts-all-other-zords-to-shame/2900-4499/\">click here to jump ahead to check that out</a>.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>An interesting unboxing experience, pricing, and release date</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4072209-pxl_20221202_142742382.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>As previously mentioned, the Dragonzord will cost $132--$30 cheaper than the Megazord we discussed earlier in the year. And there's no preorders for the Zord, as it is available right now.</p><p>The box art is fantastic, per usual.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Back of the box</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4072210-pxl_20221202_142754518.mp.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The back of the box shows the Dragonzord and how it combines with the Megazord to make Dragonzord Battle Mode and the Mega Dragonzord. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Inside the box</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4072211-pxl_20221202_143013150.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Obviously, my photo box isn't big enough for this experience, and I wasn't in the mood to spend too much time editing this photo, so you get to see this beautiful artwork with an unedited background. But seriously, the inside art is fantastic, and the best part is there's no plastic--which is just a pain when unboxing. It's a lot of cardboard, and it has beautiful designs on it.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Dragonzord</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4072212-pxl_20221202_143627563.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The figure is pretty at first glance and looks just like how it appeared on the live-action series back in the '90s. There is plenty of articulation, all while still giving it that stiff \"person in a costume that limits movement\" feeling.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Dragonzord</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4072213-pxl_20221202_143639633.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The mouth opens as well--just don't open it too much, as there is another face hiding in there for Battle Mode.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Inside its head</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4072214-pxl_20221202_143648120.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Like all of the other Zords, there is a movable piece in the head that reveals the Power Ranger, piloting the Zord from the inside.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Accesories</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4072215-pxl_20221202_143940087.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Zord comes with a few accessories as well, like missiles you can attach to the fingers, which give a feel of movement to the figure. There are also separate hands you can attach as well.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Tiny Green Rangers</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4072216-pxl_20221202_143952698.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Because this Zord is 1:144 scale, it's hard to understand just how big this is compared to the Power Rangers. While the toy stands just a few inches shorter than the Megazord--which is around a foot tall--you have two Green Rangers to compare the size to. And obviously, the Zord is massive compared to its pilot. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dragonzord: Battle Mode</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4072217-pxl_20221202_145311139.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Putting the Dragonzord into Battle Mode is so incredibly satisfying. All the pieces fit very well together. There was an issue getting the chest piece out when trying to transform it--mainly because the instructions weren't clear enough--but once I figured it out, it took seconds to change it between Battle Mode and the Dragonzord.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dragonzord: Battle Mode</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4072218-pxl_20221202_145609774.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Just to compare the size, here's Battle Mode next to the Tyrannosaurus and Pterodactyl Zords. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mega Dragonzord</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4072219-pxl_20221202_150858995.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>I remember seeing this for the first time on TV, and I lost my mind. Putting it together myself for the first time, I had to admit that the Mega Dragonzord looks kind of dumb. Battle Mode is a far superior-looking Zord. Anyway, getting the Dragonzord to stay on top of the Megazord for the first time was a bit of a pain. There's only two small connection points in the Megazord's neck to click it into. It took a while, and there was a lot of fidgeting with the Dragonzord and Megazord in order to get it to stick in.</p><p>Eventually, it all got clicked in, and that was that. It didn't stay in this form very long, as Battle Mode and the plain old Dragonzord looked the coolest.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Final thoughts</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4072220-pxl_20221202_151321781.portrait.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Personally, I was much more excited about the Dragonzord than the Megazord when it was announced. This is a pricey, but very cool collectible. It can hold up to play--or even a child playing with it, which was also tested--but the instructions were a tad confusing and lead to some frustration when trying to change it into its various forms. This Lightning Collection Zord is for the serious collector though and not really a casual purchase. Again, this is $132, and that seems a little overpriced for this collectible.</p><p>So Hasbro... let's talk about Titanus now... and then the White Tigerzord too.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Power Rangers Lightning Collection Mighty Morphin Blue Ranger Power Lance</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4072221-pxl_20221202_012952762.portrait.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Hasbro Pulse also has a few Mighty Morphin' weapons available. We talked about the Power Sword a few months back, which was fantastic. The newly-released Power Lance is a very well-designed toy for $132. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Blue Ranger Power Lance</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4072222-pxl_20221202_014441924.portrait.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>It comes with a base that can hold the Power Lance as one piece or separated. Much like the Power Sword, it lights up and makes noises, depending on what you're doing with it.</p><p>Sadly, it does not play the Power Rangers theme song, like the Power Sword did, which was a little bit of a disappointment. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Blue Ranger Power Lance</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4072223-pxl_20221202_014643273.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Connected and fully extended, it comes in at 54 inches long. It doesn't have the same bells and whistles as the Power Sword, but the Power Lance is pretty fantastic and feels very heavy duty.
