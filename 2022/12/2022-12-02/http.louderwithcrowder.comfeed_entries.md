Declaring that <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/12/01/elon-musk-twitter-republican-conservative-politics" target="_blank">Musk is totes a Republican now</a>. </p><p>It's not that Elon has come out and offered such shocking policy ideas like girls are girls and boys are boys, you shouldn't be allowed to enter this country illegally, or that maybe fifteen weeks is enough time to decide whether or not to abort your choice. Thought they did offer some examples of his Republicanness.</p><blockquote>[SCHMOVID] restrictions, high taxes and regulations in California also spurred an ideological shift right, and a physical move to Texas, now the home of Tesla's headquarters.</blockquote><p>Elon is hardly the only person who has fled the suckhole California has turned into. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mexico-americans-gentrification" target="_blank">Some are even crossing the border the other way</a>. Plus Elon moved to Austin. That's California Jr.</p><blockquote><span></span>The billionaire insists he is "neither conventionally right nor left" — but he also says the threat to free speech allegedly posed by Democrats has triggered a "battle for the future of civilization" that trumps all other policy issues</blockquote><p>Free speech has become a "Republican" issue, and the jornalismer in the journalisming-content industry acts as if that's a bad thing.</p><blockquote><span></span>"The woke mind virus has thoroughly penetrated entertainment and is pushing civilization towards suicide," Musk tweeted last week. "There needs to be a counter-narrative."</blockquote><p>That makes Elon Musk as much of a Republican <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-maher-joe-rogan" target="_blank">as Bill Maher</a>. </p><blockquote><span></span>Musk has cited criticism from progressive politicians like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a central factor in his political evolution — at one point calling Democrats "the party of division & hate."</blockquote><p>It's understandable that when people you thought were your friends turn on you and accuse you of white supremacy over having one or two opinions they disagree with, it might cause you not to want to play with them anymore. Though, in the case of AOC, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aoc-elon-musk-love-story" target="_blank">something else may be going on</a>.</p><p>Elon Musk didn't become a Republican. He's sure as hell not a conservative. Musk is as moderate as he's ever been. It just happened that while Elon stood still, Democrats went so radically left and batsh*t crazy, it left moderates to have more in common with Republicans. Plus we have punch and pie.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Ron DeSantis turns a question about a 'divided' GOP into one giant subtweet about you know who

As the saying goes, Big Dog doesn't acknowledge Little Dog. The media will try to start drama. I'd be disappointed if they didn't. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-responds" target="_blank">DeSantis doesn't have to take the bait</a>.</p><p>Another reporter tried on Thursday. They wanted America's Governor's thoughts on a "divided" GOP. Golly, I wonder who the reporter had in mind? </p><p>DeSantis started by pointing out the crooked media was lying when they said there was no "red wave" on Election Day. Then he realized they meant everywhere except for Florida. The crooked media had a point there.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">WATCH: Ron DeSantis responds to reporter asking about "divided" Republican Party<br /><br />"We assumed we were gonna end up with like 245 House members, we're at 222 it looks like [...] Why did that happen? [...] We really showed, I think, how it's done in the state of Florida." <a href="https://t.co/nkZewp5QFy">pic.twitter.com/nkZewp5QFy</a><br />— Florida’s Voice (@FLVoiceNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/FLVoiceNews/status/1598345291522088960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>DeSantis shared his thoughts on why he thought the GOP didn't do as well as he did in Florida. For some reason, a number of our candidates repelled voters even though Joe Biden and the Democrats have been an unmitigated disaster. The lack of the red wave on Election Night has caused a number of conservatives to say it's time to move on to new leaders. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-donald-trump" target="_blank">One leader in particular</a> keeps coming up as <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/donald-trump-desantis-rant" target="_blank">someone we should move on</a> from.</p><blockquote>Some of those voters throughout the country - not in Florida, throughout the country - even though they disapproved of Biden, even though they disapproved of the direction of the country, they still didn't want to vote for some of our candidates. Producing results and then that ends up attracting more people to wanna be on your team, and so, that was not something that was happening throughout the rest of the country.</blockquote><p>No names were mentioned. Though, the criticism others have tied to one specific name was echoed by DeSantis.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>As of this writing, the one person who has announced he's running for the Republican nomination has yet to respond. He's been a little tied up with other matters for the past week.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Obama warns Americans about letting their 'Uncle Joe' have any responsibilities. Their 'Uncle Joe.'

If you were to create a fictional uncle to make a point during a political speech, that's how many names to choose from.

<p>Now, before the "independent" "fact" checkers circle the wagons because -- heaven forbid -- conservatives are having too much fun, it's sus to think Obama was talking about Joe Biden. He was there to rally support for Democrats to get out the vote for the Georgia run-off election. Attacking members of his own party wouldn't help encourage members of that party to vote for his candidate. It would take a real nincompoop to discourage people from voting in the run-off. In Georgia. Seriously, who does that?</p><p>Though, critics <em>do say</em> Joe Biden says a lot of "crazy stuff" and is not someone who should be given any responsibilities. And it's not like Georgians doesn't have Joe Biden on theor mind He's on Georgia Democrats' minds because they're hoping he doesn't come to Georgia to say a lot of crazy stuff. And out of all the names in the world -- thousands on thousands on thousands -- Obama chose "Joe."</p><p>Not Uncle Zeke or Uncle John or Uncle Willard. "Uncle Joe." It makes you think.</p><p><p>
