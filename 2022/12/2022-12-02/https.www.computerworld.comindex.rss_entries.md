<p>Look, it's no big secret that I'm a fan of Google's Pixel program.</p><p>I've personally owned Pixel phones since the first-gen model graced our gunk-filled pockets way back in 2016. And Pixels have been the only Android devices I've wholeheartedly recommended for most folks ever since.</p><p>There's a reason. And more than anything, it comes down to the software and the overall <em>experience </em>Google's Pixel approach provides.</p><ul>
<li>Part of that is the Pixel's interface and the lack of any unnecessary meddling and complication — including the absence of confusing (and <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3514999/samsung-selling-data.html">often privacy-compromising</a>) duplicative apps and services larded onto the phone for the manufacturer's business benefit and at the <em>expense </em>of your user experience.</li>
<li>Part of it is the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3649001/pixel-phone-assistant.html">unmatched integration of exceptional Google services</a> and <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3614863/pixel-features-calling.html">exclusive Google intelligence</a> that puts genuinely useful stuff you'll actually benefit from front and center and makes it an integrated part of the Pixel package.</li>
<li>And, yes, part of it is the Pixel upgrade promise and the fact that Pixel phones are still the only Android devices where both timely and reliable software updates are a built-in <em>feature</em> and guarantee.</li>
