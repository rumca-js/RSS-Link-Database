<p dir="ltr">Magic The Gathering's Secret Lair drops allow players to pick up specialty cards at a premium. Many times, they are reprints of older cards with new art, and other times, they are entirely brand-new cards. However, launching on the <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us">Secret Lair site</a>, beginning on December 5, is a brand-new Secret Lair set that feels like an extension of variant cards from the recent set The Brothers' War. That's right, Magic is dipping back into Transformers, and here's everything in the new Secret Lair drop.</p><p dir="ltr">The Superdrop consists of three Secret Lair drops: One Shall Stand, One Shall Fall; Optimus Prime vs. Megatron; and Roll Out or Rise Up. Individually, these packs cost $30 for regular and $40 for foil. You can also buy all three together for $89 for normal or $119 for foil.</p><p dir="ltr">But it's all about what's inside the box, right? Like typical Secret Lair drops, the Magic the Gathering cards contained in the drop are separated into the three previously mentioned sets. First up is the land cards, and a quick look at the packaging inside..</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-transformers-secret-lair-superdrop-heres-whats-inside/1100-6509683/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Warhammer 40K Darktide Review - Left To Shred

<p dir="ltr">When I spoke to several teams making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-made-left-4-dead-special-according-to-the-devs-making-games-like-it/1100-6503996/">games in the Left 4 Dead lineage</a>, they each had some unique thoughts on why the game, and its resulting genre, works. But they also each echoed one similar thought: Pacing reigns supreme. Horde shooters, like Warhammer 40K Darktide, can live or die on the flow of its co-op missions. Aided by an AI director, missions must be tuned to reliably challenge, but not necessarily overwhelm the player. Impressively, Darktide gets this aspect of its grimdark missions exactly right, though the ways in which the game adds new layers don't work quite as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Darktide is not just a Left 4 Dead-like, it's also the spiritual successor to Fatshark's previous series in the genre, Vermintide. Moving the experience out of the base Warhammer world and into the far-flung and grimdark future of Warhammer 40K comes with a major makeover both cosmetically and mechanically. The biggest new addition comes in the form of an arsenal of firearms that have no place in the hard fantasy of traditional Warhammer. But in the 40K era, things like hand cannons, assault rifles, and electricity-infused projectiles not only fit right in, but also dramatically alter the flow of combat by adding more range-based considerations.</p><p dir="ltr">This massive shift is well-implemented, as enemies will match you blow for blow. Fighting from a distance will see them trading shots and taking cover, and if you--or they--are able to close the gap, they'll quickly swap to melee combat. When this happens, Darktide leans into the still-great crowd-control elements first seen in Vermintide, where both nuanced swordfighting and mindless hacking and slashing are usually viable techniques--though on higher difficulties, the former naturally becomes more crucial.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40k-darktide-review-left-to-shred/1900-6418008/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4027937-fighting-games.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>As long as PlayStation has been around, it has been seen as one of the best consoles to have for fighting game fans. A rock-solid line-up of games, legacy franchises, and one of the best controller D-pads for multiple generations has made Sony's gaming hardware the default choice for some of the greatest fighting games of the era, and right now, not much has changed on that front. We've rounded up the best PlayStation fighting games for PS5 and PS4.</p><p>With the PS4 being a hub for fighting games during their renaissance in the 2010s and the PS5 being backwards compatible with the vast majority of that library, we've slipped into our most comfortable Walmart-sourced karate gi and stepped into the ring to face off with the best that the PlayStation has to offer. Below, you'll find our picks for the best PlayStation fighting games to play on PS5 and PS4. Instead of ranking these fighters, we've listed our choices in alphabetical order.</p><p>For more lists, you can check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-playstation-rpgs-for-ps5-and-ps4/2900-4148/">best RPGs for PS4 and PS5</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-free-ps5-games-to-play-in-2022/2900-3961/">best free PS5 games</a> available right now, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-games-must-play-playstation-5-games/2900-3832/">must-play PS5 titles</a> for the system.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4027901-blazbluecrosstagbattle.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>You could fill this entire list with games from renowned developer Arc System Works--and trust us, they're here in force--but some of its lesser-known properties are worth looking at. BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle looks and feels like the perfect template for an Arc game, a flashy anime brawler with ultimate attacks that can melt your retinas if you stare too long. Beyond that initial snazzy impression, Cross Tag is a standout title in the 2D anime fighting game genre thanks to its dynamic tag system, fascinating mechanics, and a versatile selection of characters to choose from.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blazblue-cross-tag-battle-review-the-tag-team-drea/1900-6416926/">BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle review</a>.</em></p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Blazblue-Cross-Battle-Special-playstation-4/dp/B07YM2VCCF?tag=gamespotdeals-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp">See on Amazon</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Capcom Fighting Collection</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4027900-capcomfightingcollection.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>It's a slight cheat, but we're hellbent on getting Darkstalkers on this list and can do so thanks to the release of the Capcom Fighting Collection.It's full of Darkstalkers titles that prove just how important this series is to the history of fighting games. It's not just Darkstalkers being represented with a loving approach in this collection though, as you can also go hands on with the superb Street Fighter Alpha series in a presentation that goes all in on its arcade heritage.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/capcom-fighting-collection-review-family-feud/1900-6417898/">Capcom Fighting Collection review</a>.</em></p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Capcom-Fighting-Collection-PlayStation-4/dp/B09T5WW1YD?tag=gamespotdeals-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp">See on Amazon</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dead or Alive 6</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4027899-deadoralive5lastround.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The best entry in the long-running Dead or Alive series, DOA 6 perfects its trademark formula by making every single jab, roundhouse kick, and grapple feel like it genuinely matters.

Another knockout from Arc System Works, DNF Duel is set in the world of Dungeon Fighter Online and gives players an experience that's easy to pick up but rewarding to invest time and effort into as they master its systems. It's Arc System Works once again delivering a wonderfully complex fighting game, adapting an established IP into a title that's fun in online or offline play.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dnf-duel/">DNF Duel review</a>.</em></p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/DNF-Duel-PlayStation-4/dp/B09WG76XBJ?tag=gamespotdeals-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp">See on Amazon</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dragon Ball FighterZ</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4027897-dragonballfighterz.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>One of the best fighting games of the last generation, Dragon Ball FighterZ hits every beat for what a Dragon Ball game should be.

It's a Newtonian law put into effect inside of the famed octagon, because for every snapkick action there's an equal and opposing reaction waiting to be pulled off in this polished heavyweight contender. The mat game has vastly improved submissions, the strikes land with brutal efficiency, and a gentle learning curve helps newcomers perfect their own skills on the mat.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/EA-SPORTS-UFC-4-PlayStation/dp/B08BTD27T4?tag=gamespotdeals-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp">See on Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Garou - Mark of the Wolves</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4027895-garou-markofthewolves.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Fatal Fury doesn't get nearly enough love for its influence on the fighting game genre. If you missed out on the superb series during its heyday, then the school of hard knocks is in session with this updated gem. Originally released in 1999 and then regularly released onto more modern platforms every couple of years, Garou: Mark of the Wolves can still land a stylish knockout blow with its fast-paced action, colorful characters, and rollback netcode that makes it a cult-classic with fans.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fatal-fury-mark-of-the-wolves-review/1900-2822675/">Fatal Fury: Garou - Mark of the Wolves review</a>.</em></p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0576-CUSA06000_00-GAROUMOW00000001">See on PlayStation Network</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Granblue Fantasy: Versus</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4027894-granbluefantasyversus.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/granblue-fantasy-versus-review-fighting-fantasy/1900-6417420/">Granblue Fantasy: Versus review</a>.</em></p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Granblue-Fantasy-Versus-PlayStation-4/dp/B018F6NVFQ?tag=gamespotdeals-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp">See on Amazon</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Guilty Gear Strive</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4027893-guiltygearstrive.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Before it was producing the best adaptations of Dragon Ball, Granblue, and Dungeon Fighter Online, Arc System Works was making a name for itself with Guilty Gear. Transitioning from its 2D anime fighter roots to a more modern design in Unreal Engine, Guilty Gear Strive is heavy metal melee action that's perfect for newcomers and fighting game veterans. It's welcoming to rookies, rewarding for experts, and everyone can have a great time when they throw down in this stylish genre gold standard.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/guilty-gear-strive-review-burning-like-a-roman-cancel/1900-6417688/">Guilty Gear Strive review</a>.</em></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/BANDAI-NAMCO-Entertainment-193773-Guilty/dp/B08MRGH7X4?tag=gamespotdeals-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp">See on Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Injustice 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4027892-injustice2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Could Batman beat Superman in a fight? If you want to end that debate once and for all by taking matters into your own hands, then you should grab Injustice 2 for a super-powered showdown. From Mortal Kombat studio NetherRealm, Injustice 2 is a hard-hitting and good-looking fighting game that stars the greatest heroes and villains of DC Comics and smashes them together into a clash of titans. It has its own distinct feel, one of the best loot systems in the genre, and a story that makes the superhero civil war hit you right in the emotion organs with every cataclysmic haymaker.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/injustice-2-review/1900-6416680/">Injustice 2 review</a>.</em></p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Injustice-2-Legendary-PlayStation-4-PS4/dp/B07L9KQCC1?tag=gamespotdeals-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp">See on Amazon</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The King of Fighters XV</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4027891-thekingoffightersxv.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>SNK's long-running King of Fighters franchise has struggled to find a mainstream audience over the decades, but if one game was to find a dedicated global player base, then it was this splendid redemption story. With KOF 14 receiving a tepid response when it first launched, SNK went back to the drawing board for KOF 15 and turned it into a serious contender. Gameplay was tightened up, the cast was as impressively massive as usual, and it had more personality in every pixel than ever before. It may not be a fighting game paradigm shift, but KOF 15 is still a satisfying return to form for the veteran franchise.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-king-of-fighters-xv-review-wanna-play-some-kof/1900-6417830/">The King of Fighters XV review</a>.</em></p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/King-Fighters-XV-PlayStation-4/dp/B09F1CZPDZ?tag=gamespotdeals-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp">See on Amazon</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate Edition</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4027890-mortalkombat11.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>While there's no telling just how long it'll be before Mortal Kombat returns with a bloody uppercut and outrageous Fatalities, the latest mainline entry remains a popular game in the community--and for good reason. It has a story mode that puts most other fighting games to shame, it spills more blood than a busy abattoir before a beef festival kicks off down the road, and it's a technical marvel of gory graphics. Even better, Mortal Kombat 11 has some of the best guest stars in its roster, so if you've ever wanted to see if the Joker could beat Robocop in a fight, this is the game for you.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mortal-kombat-11-review/1900-6417127/">Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate Edition review</a>.</em></p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Mortal-Kombat-Ultimate-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B08KVFZQPL?tag=gamespotdeals-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp">See on Amazon</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Multiversus</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4027889-multiversus.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Having just released this year, Multiversus is already making waves with its Smash-like gameplay that gives Nintendo's premier fighting game series a run for its money.

<p>With the news breaking earlier this week that Mike Flanagan, along with partner Trevor Macy, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prolific-netflix-horror-creator-mike-flanagan-leaves-for-new-deal-at-amazon/1100-6509650/">leaving Netflix for Amazon Studios</a>, a shadow of doubt was cast over the fate of their freshman series The Midnight Club. Today the news was confirmed that a second season of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mike-flanagans-the-midnight-club-is-looking-for-members-in-first-trailer/1100-6507672/">Christopher Pike adaptations</a> won't come to fruition, but Flanagan wanted to give fans some closure.</p><p>Over at his <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/flanaganfilm/702543785726558208/the-midnight-club-season-two?source=share&amp;_branch_match_id=938463624314515798&amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAAwXBWxKAIAgAwBMp/90GnzAJVmKOnb5dMrvGAYDmbUpoj49doDRUrKiFm4BRdsJJuZK52GZwI+Po6mx1uM+PdtrrjSw/eFZK4kwAAAA=">Tumblr</a> page, the horror creator talked about the things that were left on the table and the future he had planned for the series and the characters that would have played out for the second season, and maybe even after that.</p><p>"I'm very disappointed that Netflix has decided not to pursue a second season of The Midnight Club," Flanagan posted. "My biggest disappointment is that we left so many story threads open, holding them back for the hypothetical second season, which is always a gamble. So I'm writing this blog as our official second season, so you can know what might have been, learn the fates of your favorite characters, and know the answers to those dangling story threads from the first season.

<p>Netflix is one of the biggest and most popular streaming services in the world, known for hits shows like Stranger Things and The Witcher and original movies like Extraction, The Irishman, and many more. From time to time, though, Netflix removes content from its library--but why?</p><p>The answer is pretty simple. Netflix pays movie and TV studios to license their content around the world, and those deals aren't good forever. Netflix would presumably want to keep as much content available for as long as possible, but this isn't always possible due licensing arrangements. As such, some titles have to leave the Netflix library.</p><p><a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/60541">In a post on its website</a>, Netflix explained that when a licensing contract for a film or TV show is coming up on its expiration date, the company considers a variety of elements. First off, Netflix needs to determine if the rights remain available. If they are available for extension, Netflix considers the popularity of a show, region-by-region, along with what a new licensing arrangement might cost.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-does-netflix-remove-movies-and-tv-shows/1100-6509663/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-callisto-protocol/">The Callisto Protocol</a> isn't an easy game--it can pose quite the challenge even on its easiest difficulty, actually. As such, you'll want to have as many weapons as possible at your disposal as you make your way through hoards of enemies, which means exploring for missable schematics that can let you craft new guns. One early game schematic is for the Skunk Gun, and missing this one could have a detrimental effect on your survivability. We'll tell you where to find it below.</p><h2>How to get the Skunk Gun</h2><p>The Skunk Gun Schematic is found in <strong>Chapter 3: Aftermath</strong>. During this chapter, you will experience an elevator crash that will lead to you exploring a dark and horror-filled basement. In this new section, you'll <strong>notice a door with a fuse box</strong> that you can't use yet. <strong>Remember this location.</strong></p><p>Make your way through the basement until you stumble upon a group of four foes that you'll have to take out. Make quick work of them and look around this area for the fuse and pick it up. Instead of using it on the nearby fuse box, <strong>head all the way back to that box mentioned above and use it there first.</strong></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-how-to-get-the-skunk-gun/1100-6509665/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Game Freak is famous for its best-selling Pokemon games, but back in 2013, the studio released Pocket Card Jockey on the 3DS in Japan.

<p><h2>Big Deals.</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4070420-2022headers%284%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Most mature industries eventually undergo consolidation, and 2022 was a monumental year for big buyouts in the video game business. Going into the year, experts predicted that 2022 would be the biggest on record for gaming deals--<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/red-hot-gaming-market-breach-150-billion-deals-fundraising-report-2022-01-31/">amounting to $150 billion</a>--and the prediction held up.</p><p dir="ltr">In this gallery, we're running through some of the biggest gaming buyouts of 2022, including Take-Two's acquisition of Zynga, Microsoft's bid to purchase Activision Blizzard (and the ensuing drama), Sony buying Bungie, and more. The mobile sector drove a lot of growth in 2022, as the platform continues to see gains ahead of levels seen by PC and console platforms. Take-Two, for example, already owns Grand Theft Auto but went after Zynga to help expand its mobile portfolio. Microsoft, meanwhile, has said its pursuit of Activision Blizzard was focused more around establishing a mobile footprint than trying to make Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox.</p><p dir="ltr">This gallery is not an exhaustive list of all the acquisitions in the video game space in 2022, but is meant to highlight some of the biggest.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2022s-biggest-gaming-news-huge-gta-6-leak-ps5-price-hike-e3-returns/2900-4486/">GameSpot's rundown of 2022's biggest gaming news stories.</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Take-Two Buys Zynga</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1576/15769789/3248156-5a2f971493f5860f2fcc3cd0d18fa20cf1b2b731.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">2022 started out with a bang when GTA parent company Take-Two announced it would spend $12.7 billion to acquire FarmVille company Zynga. Take-Two bought Zynga for more than the purchase prices of Star Wars (Disney) and Bethesda (Microsoft) combined because mobile is the fastest growing segment in the video game industry and Take-Two wanted a bigger piece. This was the biggest deal in the history of video games by a wide margin when it was announced, but that record quickly fell.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Microsoft Bids For Activision Blizzard</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4070401-screenshot2022-11-30at3.16.09pm.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">In February, Microsoft shocked the gaming world when it announceda proposal to buy Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion. This purchase price makes it Microsoft's biggest acquisition in its history (LinkedIn ranks No. 2 at $26.2 billion) and the biggest ever in the video game business. Microsoft is seeking to buy Activision Blizzard and all of its franchises and studios, including behemoths like Call of Duty, Diablo, Warcraft, Overwatch, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Given the size and scale of the deal, it continues to face regulatory challenges and isn't expected to be complete until 2023, if all goes to plan. Sony has protested Microsoft's bid, citing Call of Duty potentially going exclusive to Xbox as a key point of concern, but Microsoft has maintained that Call of Duty will continue to be released on PlayStation consoles for years to come. Beyond that, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has said the deal is more about helping Microsoft get a foothold in the mobile gaming market with Activision Blizzard's Candy Crush franchise and others.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sony Buys Bungie</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1593/15930215/3611178-s9_screenshots_6.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Sony wants to have 10 live-service games in the market by 2026, and it picked up a big one earlier this year when it acquired Destiny developer Bungie for $3.6 billion. The Destiny series will remain multiplatform going forward, but it will become a PlayStation property. Bungie is developing other upcoming games, too, including a mobile project, and these will be PlayStation games as well. Bungie boss Pete Parsons said of the deal, "Our original universes have immense potential and, with SIE's support, we will propel Bungie into becoming a global multimedia entertainment company dedicated to delivering on our creative vision."</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>New York Times Buys Wordle</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4070402-wordle.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The viral word game Wordle became a bonafide phenomenon in 2022, so naturally it attracted acquisition interest. Creator Josh Wardle sold the game to The New York Times for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wordle-creator-explains-why-he-sold-to-the-new-york-times/1100-6501982/">reported seven-figure fee</a>. The game remains free under its new owner, but whether or not that continues to be the case going forward remains to be seen.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Netflix Gets Serious About Games</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4070403-netflix.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Netflix is pushing into the world of video games with its Netflix Games label, and 2022 was a big year for the company for buyouts. As of November 2022, Netflix has six internal game studios, five of which it acquired or started in 2022.

<p>The Callisto Protocol, the next game from Dead Space and Call of Duty veteran Glen Schofield and the debut offering from Striking Distance Studios, launches today, December 2. Reviews for the game are now online as well, painting a picture of what critics are saying about the long-awaited gruesome horror game.</p><p>Here at GameSpot, reviewer Jordan Ramee's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-callisto-protocol-review-i-dont-belong-here/1900-6418007/">Callisto Protocol review</a> scored the game a 5/10. Ramee wrote, "Some genuine horror might have improved the experience of this survival-action game, but The Callisto Protocol instead leans too far into absurd high-octane spectacle, dampening the tension and adulterating the narrative core of the experience."</p><p>The Callisto Protocol is a spiritual successor, of sorts, to Dead Space. It is Striking Distance's first game and was originally meant to be a game set in the PUBG universe (PUBG owner Krafton also owns Striking Distance), but it later shifted away from that ambition.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-the-callisto-protocol-heres-what-the-critics-think/1100-6509659/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Seasonal Artifacts are useful for the boost in power that they provide to players, but the real benefits come from the selection of unlockable perks that can be used in tandem with specific subclass builds to create devastating builds and a number of anti-Champion mods that come in handy for higher-level PvE activities.</p><p>For the next season, <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/51999">Bungie says</a> that the Seasonal Artifact will focus on the Stasis subclass and will feature some experimental mods that don't follow the usual formula. Next season will also see some tweaks to the Stasis subclass, so this artifact will come at a time when Bungie wants more players to experiment with a subclass that has largely been left aside in favor of the overhauled Solar, Void, and Arc skillsets.</p><p>Artifact mods for the chest and leg slots will grant bonuses to resilience and mobility, respectively, and there'll be a helmet mod that grants additional airborne effectiveness to your weapons. "The Monochromatic Maestro mod in the class item slot rewards you generously for using weapons and subclasses that match their damage types," Bungie added.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-19-artifact-will-make-solo-legend-lost-sector-activities-a-little-bit-easier/1100-6509657/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

In Trials of Osiris, the deadly PvP mode that runs every weekend, a trip to the Lighthouse after a flawless run will see some new gear unlocked.</p><p>Alongside regular rewards such as Burden of Guilt and The Inquisitor, players can earn the Exalted Truth hand cannon and the Unwavering Duty machine gun again.

## Destiny 2 Shotguns And Glaives Are Getting Big Changes In Season 19

<p>Season 18 of Destiny 2 introduced a number of small but substantial changes to almost every weapon archetype in the game, and for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-19-start-date-updates-and-everything-we-know/1100-6509329/">Season 19</a>, Bungie will be doing some more fine-tuning on its digital arsenal. One of the bigger changes being applied to all weapon types will be a Full Auto toggle, which players will be able to find in the gameplay section of the settings menu once Season 19 goes live, allowing for all weapons to become fully automatic tools.</p><p><a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/51999">Bungie explained in its weekly blog post</a> that it'll be looking into additional ways for players to pick which types of weapons this setting applies to after next year's Lightfall expansion launches, and certain melee weapon attacks are also being looked at for a similar modification in the future.</p><p>For the weapon archetypes that didn't get tweaked in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-patch-6-2-5-revamps-almost-every-weapon-archetype/1100-6508387/">mid-season patch</a>, Bungie will update them with more substantial changes when compared to previous patches. These are very granular changes, but in a nutshell, expect each archetype to lean harder into its core identity and to have more of a signature feel in combat. Shotguns will have a fixed spread pattern that changes based on the weapons manufacturer, and Bungie is expecting to revisit these changes in future seasons as it narrows down the right feel for each brand of close-range weapon.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-shotguns-and-glaives-are-getting-big-changes-in-season-19/1100-6509656/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2: Season 19 Will See Dozens Of Exotic Weapons Buffs And Nerfs

<p>With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-19-start-date-updates-and-everything-we-know/1100-6509329/">Season 19 around the corner</a>, Bungie has shared more details on how several of its Exotic weapons will be tweaked for the next period of activity. <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/51999">Bungie identified</a> a number of weapons to apply amplified traits to, with a specific subset of Exotic weapons receiving a buff to the Fundamentals perk. Borealis, Hard Light, and Dead Messenger, which feature the ability to cycle through different elements, will each receive increased handling, range, stability, and aim assist stats depending on which element is currently active.</p><p>Borealis, a sniper rifle that also falls into that category of Exotic weapons, will receive a more substantial buff that will make it even more powerful Breaking a matched enemy shield will refill the magazine from reserves and allows for your next five shots to deal bonus damage. Jade Rabbit, one of the more popular scout rifles, is also getting a big redesign. Bungie says that landing three critical hits will return a round to the magazine and increase the damage of the next body shot, and players will be able to stack up to three of these enhanced rounds.</p><p>While the Exotics above are getting some great buffs, a few other weapons are getting nerfs as well. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-controversial-divinity-will-be-getting-a-nerf-in-season-19/1100-6508098/">The Divinity trace rifle is one controversial weapon</a> that will see some of its power dialed back and will see its Weaken debuff effect reduced from 30% to 15%. Witherhoard has been one of the most popular grenade launchers due to its ability to deal high damage quickly, so for PvE, the Taken portal area of effect will have its time shortened from 7.5 seconds to 4.5 seconds.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-19-will-see-dozens-of-exotic-weapons-buffs-and-nerfs/1100-6509655/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-callisto-protocol/">The Callisto Protocol</a> is a survival horror game, so you'll be scrounging for ammo and supplies throughout the campaign. What you might not expect, though, is that a few of its weapons are actually completely missable if you aren't thorough in your exploration. This means that you could end the game with only two guns and a melee weapon--but that shouldn't be a problem, since we've got the locations of all story and optional weapons below.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Stun Batton</h2><p dir="ltr">The Stun Batton is automatically obtained during the Outbreak chapter and will be your melee weapon throughout the remainder of the game. You'll snag this after a room with two giant fans and a bunch of enemies. Just crawl through the nearby shaft and you'll get the weapon during a short cutscene.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Hand Cannon</h2><p dir="ltr">The Hand Cannon is automatically obtained during the Outbreak chapter and is the first ranged weapon you'll have access to. Late in the mission, you'll enter a room where Elias will toss you part of a pistol. Take this over to the Reforge nearby and purchase the Hand Cannon to move the story forward.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-where-to-find-all-weapons/1100-6509618/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Survival horror games are known to be a little slow for the sake of tension, but that's not really the case for Striking Distance Studios' action-packed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-callisto-protocol/">The Callisto Protocol</a>. This new game--which is heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-space-2008/">Dead Space</a>--keeps things moving at a pretty brisk pace with an onslaught of cinematic set piece moments and no shortage of grotesque monsters to kill in equally grotesque ways. If you're wondering how long it will take to complete The Callisto Protocol, we've got the answer for you.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How long to beat The Callisto Protocol</h2><p dir="ltr">The Callisto Protocol is a mostly linear survival horror experience with an average playtime of <strong>approximately 10 hours</strong> on its normal difficulty--and there is little to do beyond seeing its main story through. The majority of the levels are very straightforward and feature occasional optional paths that can be explored for resources or collectible implants and voice memos, though none of these detours are substantial enough to pad out the game's length by much.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're a completionist looking to finish the game's full Trophy or Achievement list, you won't find a lot that extends the playtime, either. The hardest and most time-consuming part simply requires you to beat it on Maximum Security (the hardest difficulty), which is available from the start and may increase the total playtime by a few hours. Still, the game remains a compact ride with the remainder of the Trophy or Achievement list consisting of things like finding collectibles or killing enemies in ways that are likely to come naturally as you play. Lastly, there are a few optional weapons to find along the way, but we've got you covered on that.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-long-is-the-callisto-protocol/1100-6509619/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Despite releasing a full 15 years later, you could argue that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-callisto-protocol/">The Callisto Protocol</a> is the spiritual predecessor to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-space-2008/">Dead Space</a>, given the original pitch from director Glen Schofield was for Visceral Games' survival-horror title to be set within a prison, not a mining vessel. And in a lot of ways, The Callisto Protocol similarly dazzles with its incredible art direction and sound design, even emulating Dead Space's over-the-shoulder third-person perspective and integrated HUD. However, The Callisto Protocol goes its own way by focusing on melee strikes and dodges, utilizing a combat system that feels great at first but isn't suitable for the game's more action-focused latter half. Plus, lengthy death animations compound the frustrations of surprise difficulty spikes, creating an experience that feels like an uneven mix of horror and action that fails to adequately commit to or excel at either.</p><p dir="ltr">In The Callisto Protocol, you play as Jacob Lee, a freight transporter contracted to ferry cargo for the United Jupiter Company, moving supplies from the UJC-operated Black Iron Prison on Callisto to the colony on Europa. On a routine trip back to Black Iron, Jacob's ship is boarded by Outer Way, a group blamed for a recent terrorist attack on Europa. In the ensuing struggle, Jacob and Outer Way leader Dani Nakamura are the only survivors, stranded on Callisto. They're both picked up by Black Iron security head Captain Leon Ferris and incarcerated in the prison on orders from warden Duncan Cole. Jacob awakes in Black Iron hours later, discovering a mysterious infection has been released into the prison, transforming the prisoners and guards into biophage monsters. Escaping from his cell, he teams up with fellow prisoner Elias Porter to find a way out.</p><p dir="ltr">The Callisto Protocol doesn't devote too much time to storytelling and worldbuilding. None of the characters (save for Elias) are especially likable, and though the main villain has an intriguing motivation--you can clearly see how The Callisto Protocol was originally intended to fit into the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a>' universe once you find out what the bad guy is up to--it's only revealed <em>right </em>as the game is concluding. I wish it had been revealed far sooner because, though the ramifications of it are interesting, there's not enough space in the plot for those ramifications to be explored. The game fleshes out the world up to that point with optional audio logs to discover, but most don't actually reveal all that much, and those that do aren't very interesting to listen to. It's ultimately not worth going off the path in pursuit of these collectibles.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-callisto-protocol-review-i-dont-belong-here/1900-6418007/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
