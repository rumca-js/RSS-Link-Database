Chisora should retire. He shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near the ring, let alone in there with Tyson.”</p><p>Only 11 months later, Warren is promoting the very fight that seemed such a shameful idea in January when Chisora was recovering from a second successive loss to Joseph Parker. Chisora, as always, had fought with great courage against Parker and there was no shame in him suffering his 12th defeat in 45 draining fights which stretched back to his professional debut in February 2007. Yet concern for Chisora intensified as he has endured far too many gruelling bouts in his long career. The damage he has already suffered is obvious and any additional bout could pose a serious threat to his health.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/02/tyson-fury-and-derek-chisora-bang-forlorn-drum-for-disturbing-rematch">Continue reading...</a>

There’s a reason politicians refer to “bread-and-butter issues”: because there is nothing abstract about food and what it costs.</p><p>Looking back, it was always a tell that leave campaigners sought to avoid the realm of the concrete, preferring to stick with intangible talk of “independence” or a regained mastery of our national destiny. They knew reality was a hostile environment for the Brexit project, one that would expose its folly. Remainers tried to resist, hoping not to fight on the battlefield of dreams but on the terrain of facts and figures, yet it never worked. It just made them sound boring, casting them as spoilsport bean-counters and, besides, all their numbers were themselves abstractions – projections of a hypothetical future. The forecasts of gloom could be, and were, swatted aside as “project fear”.</p><p>Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/02/brexit-poor-people-paying-eat-debate-human">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Son Heung-min was unmasked and South Korea were liberated from Group H. Eventually. Paulo Bento’s side left it until the 90th minute to secure the win they needed against Portugal and had to wait a further six minutes for confirmation that Uruguay had not pipped them to second place. A mass huddle gathered in the centre of the pitch erupted when their place in the last 16 was finally secured.</p><p>Son threw his mask into the air after creating Hwang Hee-chan’s late winner with a superb run and pass into the substitute’s path. The Tottenham striker had collected possession deep inside his own half from a Portugal corner before sprinting away and nut-megging Diogo Dalot for Hwang to send a cool finish past Diogo Costa.

<p>There are no winners in revenge missions. Sentiment demanded that Ghana should right the wrongs of the 2010 World Cup quarter-final against Uruguay and expiate the hurt of Luis Suárez’s last-minute handball on the line. But Uruguay, and Suárez in particular, have no time for such romantic notions of redemption. Ghana were again eliminated after missing a penalty but their only consolation was that, although Suárez set up two, it was South Korea who went through to the last 16 with Portugal.</p><p>It was a game haunted by the memory of events at Soccer City 12 years ago, and specifically by that one moment in the final minute of extra time. The image was always there, a perverse footballing pietà, flitting in the peripheral vision: Stephen Appiah in the foreground having had the initial blocked effort (which was probably offside, although nobody talks about that), John Mensah and the goalkeeper Fernando Muslera falling together with Andrés Scotti, Dominic Adiyah stretching having headed the loose ball goalwards, Diego Fucile with back arched and left fist thrust up having missed his attempt to handle, and Suárez, arms out, leaping to his right to claw the ball away. It is the Pisgah of African football, the moment when it saw the promised land of a World Cup semi-final, but was denied.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/02/ghana-uruguay-world-cup-group-h-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Ilkay Gündogan, his belongings wrapped in a bin bag, dragged himself through the mixed zone mumbling a few things about disappointment. Kai Havertz posed with his unwanted player-of-the-match award like a man clutching his divorce papers.</p><p>Others were simply mourning, wondering what more they could have done, what it all meant. “I joined in 2016,” Joshua Kimmich considered. “Before that Germany was always in the semi-finals. Then I come along and we are eliminated twice in the preliminary round, and last year in the round of 16. I’m personally connected to this failure.” The next few days will be the toughest. Germany will grieve. Germany will reflect. The really interesting part is what Germany does next.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/02/germany-latest-failure-is-mighty-but-cosmetic-problems-may-be-fixable">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s time to ditch the sharp tailoring and spiked heels. From fluffy handbags to squeezable coats, we don’t need to suffer for fashion right now</p><p>I was in the shops the other day, just looking. Except I wasn’t just looking, I was actually having a good feel. In Cos, I gave a surreptitious squeeze to a tasty-looking cosy puffer coat, as if testing a peach for ripeness. Taking a short cut through John Lewis, I was stopped in my tracks by a mouthwatering display of cashmere knits in juicy shades of orange and melon that were crying out for a stroke. Can anybody walk past a stack of fluffy sweaters without copping a quick feel? I definitely can’t be trusted to keep my hands to myself.</p><p>Then, as I bounced through H&amp;M – in my cloud-soft Ugg boots, obviously – it struck me that even the handbags were squishy. My favourite, light as air on its fine chain strap, was so cushioned and padded you could use it as a pillow, so I gave it a fondle. I used to behave like a kid in a sweet shop whenever I went into a fashion store; these days, I’m more like a fruit-addict in a greengrocer’s, squeezing everything in sight for what is not just in-season, but deliciously ripe.<br /><br />Fashion has gone soft. Sharp tailoring is out and soft edges are in. To see this shift at its most dramatic, just take a look at the coats around you next time you walk down the street. What I still think of as a Proper Coat – wool, a defined silhouette, button fastening – has become a minority choice, edged into obscurity by endless takes on padded outerwear.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/dec/02/fashion-has-gone-soft-and-squishy-which-is-a-comfort-in-hard-times">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The gift I’d like is a donation to my favourite charity. Tradition, though, I’m sticking in the shredder this year</p><p>Through headlines about sky-high heating bills and daily news of restaurant closures, the Christmas juggernaut thunders, parping its merry horn. In a land of uncertainty, here comes one definite: December and all its excess. Let’s be honest: Christmas is <em>all</em> about the “too much”. Its spurious charm is alive in abundance, in groaning fridges and in hands sore from carrying shopping bags. What heralds the little baby Jesus more than a vast, all-butter, ganache-smothered yule log going stale over Twixtmas, when the first pangs about over-expenditure kick in? Generally, this is when you find that a guest has forgotten to take that £20 bath cube assortment you bought them at a Christmas fayre. You resented paying for it at the time, and they forgot that you gave it to them. Happy bloody Christmas.</p><p>This year, though, I’ve sworn that things will be different. “Don’t buy me any gifts – I don’t need them. I just want to see you,” I told loved ones in October, hoping to save them from New Year debt, and the planet from choking on yet more plastic. I sounded like fanatical Puritan <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00f4f37">Lady Whiteadder from Blackadder</a>: “At our house, Nathaniel sits on a spike … I sit on Nathaniel. Two spikes would be an extravagance!” That’s the peril in calling time on Christmas. No one thanks you. And we are, as a country, far too wedded to the wastage, the swapping of jumpers that are too small and too scratchy to suffer, the hand creams that smell of fox urine and the three-jar dijon mustard sets, each more abrasive and inedible than the last.</p><p>Grace Dent is the patron of <a href="https://www.therockyouthproject.co.uk/">The Rock Youth Project</a> in Carlisle – if you would like to help kids in Currock celebrate Christmas, please donate at <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/therockyouthproject">www.justgiving.com/therockyouthproject</a></p><p>The next episode in the fourth series of Grace’s Comfort Eating podcast is released on Tuesday 6 December.

<p>Performers get the adoration, but where would they be without the crew toiling in pop’s engine room? Four backstage reveal all</p><p>Lester Smith is gatekeeper of the microphones at Abbey Road studios. He joined as a technical engineer in the early 70s; Paul McCartney was starting Wings, Pink Floyd would soon be in to record what would become one of the bestselling albums of all time, The Dark Side of the Moon, and the studio would later welcome a young Kate Bush. Throughout it all, Lester was in the technical room, learning how to engineer on EMI’s world-class recording equipment. He’s there to this day. Lester fell in love with microphones, and for decades has been developing and refining his skills in this corner of Abbey Road. These are the mics that have taken in the sounds – and spit – of the greatest singers in the world.</p><p>The music made inside those walls has changed, as have the faces coming in and out – even much of the building itself. But Lester has been through it all, working from his little office, building up stacks of carefully labelled valves and other skeletons of machinery around him. For all the years Lester’s been behind the mic, he and the other engineers and facilities staff have been keeping those studios alive. They tick away behind the scenes to give us the music that fills our ears every day. The music world is full of people like Lester. Although, more often than not, their contributions go largely unrecognised. Here are a few of the other unsung heroes who take the music from the studio to the stage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/02/unsung-heroes-music-tour-manager-producer-songwriter-venue-owner">Continue reading...</a>

It was a small room with a low stage against one wall, and because of the size we could never afford any bands that charged more than £30. One thing we liked about Chicken Shack was that they charged £30, so we booked them several times.

<p><strong>(Analog Africa) <br /></strong>A new compilation collects the fuzzed-out, jungle-born head-rush of wah wah and reverb that rethought a traditional folk music of Peru</p><p>Anchored in hip-swaying, syncopated clave rhythm and topped with bright flute melodies, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/sep/15/scene.and.heard.cumbia">cumbia</a> music has a centuries-old history. Originating from Colombia, its mid-tempo sound is now a staple in Latin America, and a new compilation from <a href="https://www.analogafrica.com/">Analog Africa</a> highlights an overlooked subgenre that flourished throughout 1970s and 80s Peru: cumbia Amazonica.</p><p>Amid the heat and humidity of the Peruvian jungle a group of bands developed their own psychedelic take on the folk tradition, gleaned from patchy radio broadcasts of popular cumbia music and black market vinyl imports, which featured fast-paced percussion, electric guitars and heady reverb. Across the 18 tracks of Perú Selvático, this frenetic dance music unfurls, bringing new life to a largely forgotten sound.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/02/peru-selvatico-sonic-expedition-into-the-peruvian-amazon-1972-1986-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I grew up loving Dutch football but from what I’ve seen so far in Qatar, the US are more than capable of making the last eight</p><p>The first time I realized that soccer was the world’s game was in 1978. I came home one day from playing soccer and I saw my father standing on the living room table and screaming at the television. He was wearing an orange shirt, drinking a bottle of something and eating what looked like herring in a jar. I realized he was watching the World Cup final, Argentina against his beloved Netherlands (we have Dutch roots). My father wasn’t a big drinker, but he was intoxicated both with what he was drinking and watching. My mother was in the other room shaking her head, as if to say, “I can’t condone this.”</p><p>In the course of the game, my father’s demeanor went from elation to sorrow to depression to “get away from me.” It wasn’t until a month later at dinner that my mother finally slammed her hand down on the table and said to my father: “David, talk to your son”, meaning my brother. See, the problem was my brother’s name is Brandt. And Ernie Brandts was the Dutch center-back responsible for one of Argentina’s goals. My father has not spoken to my brother for the entirety of that summer until my mother finally begged him. My brother smiled, my father realized his behavior was completely outlandish, he hugged my brother and it was over. But in that moment, I realized that this sport can touch people deeply, beyond reason and comprehension.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/02/usa-netherlands-world-cup-2022-qatar-soccer-eric-wynalda">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Domino) <br /></strong>The US punk band go full pelt for their final album, a set livid with worldly disgust and bitter humour</p><p>‘I’m on a date with God and he’s drunk,” Mish Barber-Way rasps on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uBFNx3IVMw">Date Night</a>. It’s the lead single from White Lung’s fifth and final album Premonition and one of the most incendiary songs to emerge from the last few years of turmoil. She goes on to imagine hurtling around Hollywood in a Cadillac, asking a fast-talking, bad boy God for his thoughts on the state of the world. “God would be drunk and laughing and smoking and telling me what a joke we all are and how we screwed it all up,” Barber-Way told author Melissa Broder <a href="https://whitelung.ca/about/">in a conversation</a> about Premonition, adding that “of course, God is hot.” At the end of the song the narrator strikes a match and tosses it towards LA, burning down the city and her old life along with it.</p><p>White Lung has been on accidental hiatus since 2017. The Canadian punk trio began work on Premonition late that year with a view to releasing it in 2019. Then everything changed. Barber-Way fell pregnant with her first child, then her second, entering a period of personal transformation against a backdrop of global chaos. Five years, two births and a pandemic later and Premonition captures the band in a final blaze of glory – after the foot presses flat on the gas pedal, but before the inevitable crash. Guitarist Kenneth William and drummer Anne-Marie Vassiliou are at their most wild and driving, packing every inch of space with hectic riffs and high-speed aggression; Barber-Way, writing sober for the first time, puts down lyrics about adjusting to motherhood. What emerges are anthems of rebirth at the necessary end, in which we can count the constants. In this instance: fury, hope and fierce maternal love.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/02/white-lung-premonition-review">Continue reading...</a>

Since the price cap is lower than what has previously been bandied around, it raises the spectre of some form of Russian supply retaliation which should lend support for oil prices.</p><p>However, oil prices retreated off the highs as the weaker US dollar-inspired oil rally gave way to reasons why the dollar is weakening. Specifically, weaker US economic data tempered the rally as the remarkably resilient US jobs market showed signs of cooling. Indeed, the one glaring problem the oil market faces is the anticipated run of weaker US economic data, which is the price to pay for aggressively fighting inflation. </p><p>“The European Union reportedly has cautiously agreed to a $60 price cap on Russian oil with plans to adjust the cap so that it remains at 5% below the oil price. The next step is for the proposals to be approved by all EU governments.</p><p>This week oil has been staging gains amid optimism towards the potential loosening of covid restrictions in China and the opening up of its economy at last, which could potentially unleash demand for crude oil from the world’s second largest economy.</p><p>EU nations sought to push the cap across the finish line after Poland held out to get as low a figure as possible, diplomats said Thursday. “Still waiting for white smoke from Warsaw,” said an EU diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were still ongoing.</p><p>The latest offer, confirmed by 3 EU diplomats, comes ahead of a deadline to set the price for discounted oil by Monday, when a European embargo on seaborne Russian crude and a ban on shipping insurance for those supplies take effect. The diplomats also spoke on condition of anonymity because the legal process was still not completed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/dec/02/eu-cap-russian-oil-pound-rally-dollar-us-jobs-report-business-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A young couple end up with each other’s family for Christmas in a middling assortment of sitcom cliches and laboured farce</p><p>In what feels like a record year for the number of new Christmas movies being unwrapped on the big and mostly small screens, it takes a certain extra sparkle to make one feel worthy of our time.

In Amazon’s exhaustingly eager Britcom Your Christmas or Mine?, one might struggle to see why our time is even half-demanded here rather than elsewhere, a hackneyed grab-bag of sitcom cliches that ends up feeling more like tired pantomime.</p><p>After we follow a distractingly ugly CG snowflake glide through some even uglier CG clouds, we land at Marylebone station and on a young student couple James (Sex Education’s Asa Butterfield, flatter than the film requires) and Hayley (Cora Kirk, fizzier than the film deserves) as they face being away from each other for Christmas. They prepare for their respective train journeys but a sudden burst of romance has them deciding to surprise the other and they end up finding themselves alone with a family they’ve never met before for the big day while keeping their relationship secret.

<p>For a fan, interviewing the late musician was like a surreal dream.

But it was stranger still <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/12/fleetwood-mac-stevie-nicks-christine-mcvie-nuns">hearing what she had to say</a>. As we sat together on her light grey sofa in December 2013, McVie told me how she had left Fleetwood Mac in 1998 thinking that she wanted a quiet life in the Kent countryside with her dogs and Hunter wellies. But that hadn’t been what she had wanted at all. Fifteen years on, McVie was restless, isolated, a little lonely … and wouldn’t it be nice if she could be back playing with the band? “If they were to ask me, I would probably be very delighted,” she ventured nervously.</p><p>What was I supposed to say to this? It seemed obvious to me that they would take her back in a flash. Earlier that year, Stevie Nicks had said she’d “beg, borrow and scrape together $5m and give it to her in cash if she would come back. That’s how much I miss her!” And just two months before, McVie had even appeared on stage with Fleetwood Mac to thrill the crowd with a surprise encore of her hit Don’t Stop.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/02/i-would-probably-be-delighted-how-christine-mcvie-opened-up-about-wanting-to-rejoin-fleetwood-mac">Continue reading...</a>
