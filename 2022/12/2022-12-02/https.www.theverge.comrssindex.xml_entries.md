  <p id="Wd1Qme">Wind power isn’t cleaning up as much pollution as it could, especially in communities of color and low-income neighborhoods, new research shows. The US’s wind energy boom has already led to billions of dollars of health benefits. But the majority of that hasn’t trickled into communities that have historically been burdened with the most air pollution, finds a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn8762">study</a> published today in the journal <em>Science Advances</em>. Fortunately, that could change if new wind energy projects are deployed more strategically.</p>

  <p id="esv8S5">Infowars founder Alex Jones has filed for personal bankruptcy in the wake of a billion-dollar defamation penalty. As reported by <em>Reuters </em>this morning, Jones <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txsb.459750/gov.uscourts.txsb.459750.1.0_3.pdf">filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> in a Houston court this morning. Jones’ company, Free Speech Systems, filed its own bankruptcy petition in July.</p>
<p id="F7OMWG">Today’s bankruptcy filing indicates that Jones has 50 to 99 creditors. That presumably includes over a dozen people who lost children at the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut, which Jones claimed for years had been faked — leading to a series of defamation suits that Jones lost by default. He estimated his assets to be worth between $1 million and $10 million and his liabilities between $1 billion and $10...</p>
