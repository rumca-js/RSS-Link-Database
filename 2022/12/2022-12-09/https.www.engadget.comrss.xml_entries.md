<p>Have you ever thought up an idea for a movie or play that you just know will be a smash hit, but haven't gotten around to writing the script? Alphabet's DeepMind has built an AI tool that can help get you started. <a href="https://deepmind.github.io/dramatron/"><ins>Dramatron</ins></a> is a so-called &quot;co-writing&quot; tool that can generate character descriptions, plot points, location descriptions and dialogue. The idea is that human writers will be able to compile, edit and rewrite what Dramatron comes up with into a proper script. Think of it like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-podcast-lensa-ai-avatar-images-chatgpt-133057497.html">ChatGPT</a>, but with output that you can edit into a blockbuster movie script.</p><p>To get started, you'll need <a href="https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys"><ins>an OpenAI API key</ins></a> and, if you want to reduce the risk of Dramatron outputting &quot;offensive text,&quot; a <a href="https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-enable-the-api"><ins>Perspective API key</ins></a>. To test out Dramatron, I fed in the log line for a movie idea I had when I was around 15 that <em>definitely</em> would have been a hit if <em>Kick-Ass</em> didn't beat me to the punch. Dramatron quickly whipped up a title that made sense, and character, scene and setting descriptions. The dialogue that the AI generated was logical but trite and on the nose. Otherwise, it was almost as if Dramatron pulled the descriptions straight out of my head, including one for a scene that I didn't touch on in the log line.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Playwrights seemed to agree, according to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14958.pdf"><ins>a paper</ins></a> that the team behind Dramatron <a href="https://twitter.com/DeepMind/status/1601237906894397440"><ins>presented today</ins></a>. To test the tool, the researchers brought in 15 playwrights and screenwriters to co-write scripts. According to the paper, playwrights said they wouldn't use the tool to craft a complete play and found that the AI's output can be formulaic. However, they suggested Dramatron would be useful for world building or to help them explore other approaches in terms of changing plot elements or characters. They noted that the AI could be handy for &quot;creative idea generation&quot; too.</p><div id="5e200aebdc6f47f18378153fcdfe16e3"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">✏️ We interviewed 15 industry experts including playwrights, screenwriters and actors who produced work using Dramatron.<br /><br />Canadian company <a href="https://twitter.com/theatresports?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TheatreSports</a> edited co-written theatre scripts and performed them on stage in Plays By Bots to positive reviews. <a href="https://t.co/FlGzIdCuqX">https://t.co/FlGzIdCuqX</a><a href="https://t.co/6gqnB8e1L9">pic.twitter.com/6gqnB8e1L9</a></p>— DeepMind (@DeepMind) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeepMind/status/1601237894941016066?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>That said, a playwright <a href="https://12thnight.ca/2022/08/13/oh-no-bots-have-invaded-theatre-and-they-can-do-it-plays-by-bots-a-fringe-review/"><ins>staged four plays</ins></a> that used &quot;heavily edited and rewritten scripts&quot; they wrote with the help of Dramatron.

DeepMind notes that Dramatron can output fragments of text that were used to train the language model, which, if used in a script that was produced, could lead to accusations of plagiarism. &quot;One possible mitigation is for the human co-writer to search for substrings from outputs to help to identify plagiarism,&quot; DeepMind said.</p><div id="cfd8e64ed93642089f2b0731ad0b63e3"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p>

## Self-driving electric tractor promises eco-friendly, hands-off farming

<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/john-deere-autonomous-tractor-203054726.html">autonomous tractor world</a> is heating up, apparently. CNH Industrial has <a href="https://media.cnhindustrial.com/NORTH-AMERICA/CNH-INDUSTRIAL-CORPORATE/ALL/cnh-industrial-presents-first-electric-tractor-prototype-with-autonomous-features/s/2ccdb427-427f-44bd-809c-0548d5db51c5">unveiled</a> what it says is the &quot;first&quot; electric light tractor prototype with self-driving features, the New Holland T4 Electric Power. The machine promises zero emissions, quieter operation than diesel models and (according to CNH) lower running costs while reducing the amount of time farmers spend behind the wheel. Sensors and cameras on the roof help the vehicle complete tasks, dodge obstacles and work in harmony with other equipment. You can even activate it from your phone.</p><p>The T4 Electric Power's 120HP motor produces a 25MPH top speed comparable to regular tractors. The battery is large enough to handle a day's work &quot;depending on the mission profile,&quot; CNH says. That suggests the tractor might need a mid-day top-up, but that might not necessarily be a problem when the T4 can reach a full battery in an hour using off-the-shelf fast chargers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Like Ford's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/f-150-lightning-electric-truck-013038952.html">F-150 Lightning</a>, this tractor can serve as a power pack on wheels. It has outlets to plug in common tools like drills, and it serves as a backup power source for emergencies. You can attach  hydraulic, mechanical and Power Take Off implements. Production of the completed T4 Electric Power is expected at the end of 2023, with more models on the way.</p><figure><img alt="CNH New Holland T7 Methane Power LNG tractor" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/3cda4750-77fe-11ed-9fdf-41871c7a6806" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CNH Industrial</div></figure><p>There's also an environmentally conscious option for farmers who prefer the familiarity of fuel. An <a href="https://media.cnhindustrial.com/North-America/CNH-INDUSTRIAL-CORPORATE/LATEST-NEWS/new-holland-agriculture-debuts-world-s-first-lng-tractor/s/68636ec4-451c-4e7b-8826-4e08d794dc68">equally new</a> T7 Methane Power LNG (shown at middle) is billed as the &quot;world's first&quot; liquid natural gas tractor. It can run on biomethane sourced from livestock manure — instead of letting methane <a href="https://www.engadget.com/un-global-methane-detection-system-070057307.html">slip directly into the atmosphere</a> and contribute to climate change, farmers can put the chemical to work powering their equipment. The CO2 emissions reduction for a 120-cow farm is supposedly equivalent to that of 100 &quot;western households&quot; without sacrificing diesel-like performance. The T7 LNG doesn't have a launch date, and is only characterized as a &quot;pre-production prototype.&quot;</p><p>Prices aren't available, and they may be important when farmers often have to work with tight budgets. However, CNH is betting that its technology will ultimately save money. The T4 Electric reportedly cuts operating costs by up to 90 percent thanks to the zero-fuel design and lower maintenance, and its hushed powerplant lets it work both at night and nearer to animals. The T7 LNG, meanwhile, lets farms make their own fuel, fertilizer and sellable excess electricity. Food growers could recoup at least some of their investment even as they reduce their impact on the planet.</p>

## Sam Bankman-Fried says he'll testify next week about FTX Collapse

<p>Embattled FTX co-founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said today that he will testify before Congress next week. After a Twitter back-and-forth with committee chair Rep. Maxine Waters, he agreed to testify about the crypto exchange’s sudden collapse. “I still do not have access to much of my data — professional or personal. So there is a limit to what I will be able to say, and I won’t be as helpful as I’d like,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1601186246990401537">tweeted</a> this morning. “But as the committee still thinks it would be useful, I am willing to testify on the 13th.” The House Committee on Financial Services will hold a hearing on Tuesday investigating FTX.</p><p>His agreement to testify is an about-face from last week when he tweeted that he only would appear after he finished “learning and reviewing” what led to the company’s rapid downfall. Waters replied, “Based on your role as CEO and your media interviews over the past few weeks, it’s clear to us that the information you have thus far is sufficient for testimony.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>He testimony for the House Committee will likely be remote, according to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3NhbS1iYW5rbWFuLWZyaWVkLXNldC10by10ZXN0aWZ5LXRvLWNvbmdyZXNzLWFib3V0LWZ0eC1jb2xsYXBzZS0xMTY3MDYwMzQxMD9tb2Q9cnNzX1RlY2hub2xvZ3kiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjVjY2E1ZTE2LTNiNzYtNDcwMS05ZGIyLTAyY2VhZTYzODdiOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcXnNpCFvdneY7qx1GPHTTsJXbx6JcO0LUBSFZ_39u-h&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fsam-bankman-fried-set-to-testify-to-congress-about-ftx-collapse-11670603410%3Fmod%3Drss_Technology"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>.

<p>Chevrolet has inadvertently offered a peek at its first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-corvette-ev-hybrid-142342494.html">electrified Corvette</a>. Fans on <a href="https://www.corvetteblogger.com/2022/12/08/breaking-2024-corvette-eray-leaks-on-the-visualizer-includes-new-exterior-and-interior-colors/"><em>CorvetteBlogger</em></a>, <a href="https://www.corvetteforum.com/forums/c8-eray-hybrid-ev-discussion/4693424-eray-visualizer-leak.html"><em>Corvette Forum</em></a> and elsewhere discovered that GM briefly made the 2024 Corvette E-Ray hybrid available through Chevy's online visualizer tool. The design mates the wide body of the C8 Z06 with the regular model's exhaust pipes, and introduces minor cosmetic tweaks like new colors (Cacti green, anyone?) and model-specific wheels. The biggest changes, as you might guess, sit inside.</p><p>Images of the engine bay suggest the E-Ray will use the regular C8 Corvette's LT2 V8 engine. As <em>Jalopnik</em><a href="https://jalopnik.com/2023-chevy-corvette-e-ray-hybrid-c8-leaks-online-1849873884">explains</a>, past reports have suggested this Vette will use an electric motor on the front axle to provide all-wheel drive. It might offer a combined 605HP. The absence of a charging port suggests this is a conventional hybrid rather than a plug-in, although a glimpse of the interior shows a button to control regenerative braking. You'd also see adaptive cruise control in the lineup for the first time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="a2df659a0cf54890bf11b3e38d70d976"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">C8 Corvette E-Ray, a new hybrid version with an expected total of 605 combined hp (490 engine, 115 electric) expected to be released in the next few months.. thoughts? <a href="https://t.co/8l4Wnxwgq3">pic.twitter.com/8l4Wnxwgq3</a></p>— Aaron (@aaron_g04xx) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaron_g04xx/status/1601178768860909568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>The slip-up hasn't revealed much about options.

There's no mention of pricing, but the visualizer said the hybrid would arrive in summer 2023. The brand previously said to expect the semi-electric Corvette next year, but didn't narrow the timeframe.</p><p>This is just the start of Chevy's plans to electrify its iconic sports car.

The Ronin has a low profile and large wheels, along with dihedral front doors that are open in the render, but there's no indication as to how the rear doors open just yet.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Henrik Fisker, the founder of the automaker, said earlier this year that the Ronin will have a 660-mile range under the WLTP testing standard used in Europe. The EPA range is likely to be lower, but all going to plan, Ronin drivers should be able to travel quite a distance before needing to recharge the EV.</p><p>As things stand, Fisker plans to show off a near-production-ready Ronin concept in August, with production slated to get underway in 2024. Fisker is said to be keeping the starting price under $200,000.</p><p>At the other end of the scale, Fisker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fisker-pear-ev-reservations-142030580.html"><ins>started taking reservations</ins></a> earlier this year for the five-passenger Pear, which starts at $29,900 before incentives.

Last month, Fisker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fisker-electric-ocean-suv-production-starts-173013409.html"><ins>began production</ins></a> of the Ocean SUV.

It uses Samsung's Tizen interface, allowing it to stream Netflix, HBO Max, Prime Video and similar apps even when it's not hooked up to a computer. It comes with a webcam, remote, microphone and built-in speakers, and it can double as a SmartThings hub for compatible smart home gear.

## Apple and Ericsson call truce in years-long fight over cellular patents

<p>Apple is ending another <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-01-qualcomm-reveals-revenue-from-apple-settlement.html">battle over wireless patents</a>. The iPhone maker and Ericsson <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/press-releases/2022/12/ericsson-and-apple-sign-global-patent-license-agreement">have struck</a> a licensing deal that settles all the legal disputes between the two companies, including civil lawsuits and a US International Trade Commission complaint. While the exact terms remain under wraps, the multi-year pact includes cross-licensing for &quot;standard-essential&quot; cellular technology as well as other patent rights.</p><p>The tech giants have a long history of fighting over cell tech. Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-01-14-apple-is-suing-another-tech-company-drink.html">sued Ericsson in 2015</a> to get more favorable terms for LTE patents, but Ericsson responded with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/27/ericsson-sues-apple-over-patent-licensing-seeks-to-block-iphone-and-ipad-sales/">lawsuit of its own</a> claiming that the iPhone and iPad infringed on its patented ideas.  The two achieved peace with a seven-year agreement. As that arrangement neared its renewal time, however, the animosity returned. Ericsson sued in October 2021 over Apple's attempts to shrink royalty rates, while Apple countersued in December that year over allegations Ericsson was using unfair pressure tactics for the renewal. Ericsson filed <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ericsson-sues-apple-again-over-5g-patent-licensing-2022-01-18/">another lawsuit</a> this January over 5G licenses.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We've asked Apple for comment. In announcing the deal, Ericsson's IP chief Christina Petersson said the ceasefire would let the two companies &quot;focus on bringing the best technology&quot; to the world. Ericsson is one of the world's largest wireless patent holders, and said the Apple agreement would help boost its licensing revenue for the fourth quarter to the equivalent of $532 million or more.</p><p>The timing may be significant. Apple is reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-5g-iphone-chips-2023-kuo-080605379.html">developing 5G iPhone modems</a> to replace Qualcomm's chips, having bought <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-25-apple-buys-intel-smartphone-modem-business.html">most of Intel's modem business</a> and even launching not-so-subtle recruitment efforts <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-06-apple-san-diego-qualcomm.html">in Qualcomm's backyard</a>. The Ericsson truce may help clear the path for those modems by reducing the chances of legal dust-ups over whatever Apple builds. And time might be in short supply — rumors have circulated that Apple could use its own components as soon as 2023.</p>

<p>My best headphones aren’t always the best headphones for every situation.

When you see an amusing video online but you aren’t sure if it’ll be appropriate to blare over your speakers, you use the beaters to be safe. If, like me, you need to listen to something in bed before drifting to sleep, the beaters are the headphones that won’t get in the way but will survive your tossing and turning if you pass out with them still on. And if they don’t, who cares? They’re just your beaters.</p><p>There are a million different headphones that could make for good beaters, but when most people talk about them, they think of in-ear headphones that are cheap and durable. You can toss them in a bag or (larger) pocket and know they’re likely to survive. You never have to be delicate or deliberate with them the way you would with a good set of over-ears. You don’t <em>want </em>to accidentally step on them or leave them on the train, but it won’t ruin your day if you do, because buying a new pair won't bite a hole in your paycheck. They don’t sound as nice as your good headphones, but when you can’t sit and listen for a long stretch or truly savor a recording’s details, they’re there, and they work.</p><figure><img alt="Panasonic's RP-TCM125 ErgoFit earbuds." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/13706be0-6441-11ed-9bdf-b05989581ec8" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn/Engadget</div></figure><p>The ErgoFit earphones fit this description more or less exactly. Everyone takes to in-ear headphones differently, but the ErgoFit’s earpieces are small and noticeably lightweight, with soft silicone ear tips that, for me, don’t grate over time. Panasonic includes three different sizes of tips in the box, and with the right fit they seal a decent if not amazing amount of noise. (Voices are still likely to get through if they’re loud enough, though.) They come in a variety of colors, if that matters to you. And while there’s a bit of cable noise when they rustle against your chest — which can be irritating — I’ve never had to worry about them coming loose, either.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike many earphones in this price range, there’s also an in-line remote and mic for pausing tracks and taking calls. The quality of that mic isn’t anything better than “usable,” but that it’s even there is a plus at this price. (If you don’t need a mic, Panasonic sells a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwN0o0V0hORkM_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby00eC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTMxZjgwM2UtZTc2Mi00YmM3LWFiNjItODg0NGQ4M2UxZTNlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfSfnK_h0A6ANzJZn_7qtZ7u5ux9vS9XOigNxu6u2SIj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07J4WHNFC%3Fth%3D1">variant without one</a> for $10.)&nbsp;</p><p>These are simple wired earphones made at a time when 3.5mm jacks were still common, so you need a dongle to use them with most phones and tablets today. That is annoying, but for “beater” purposes, I’ll take the trade-off of not worrying about battery life (and degradation) or having to take a beat to ensure everything's paired first. When my AirPods died on an eight-hour flight to Europe earlier this year, the ErgoFit slotted right in as backup.&nbsp;</p><p>Most importantly, they’ve lasted. I’ve carried these earphones on my person constantly over the past four-ish years and straight up fallen asleep on them more times than I can count, but in that span I’ve only had to outright replace them once due to a frayed wire. The plastic-heavy design looks and feels cheap, but it’s been enough to survive.</p><p>These things are still old and $15, so I can’t say they sound fantastic. You won’t hear the sort of detail or treble sparkle that you can get from better-sounding earphones in the $30 to $50 range, and the sound profile might be a bit too boosted in the mid- and upper-bass range for some. This isn’t a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/koss-ksc75-headphones-irl-143533671.html">Koss KSC75 deal</a> where the ErgoFit outperforms earphones five times their price.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, what's here isn't bad. The low-end is emphasized but not overly boomy, and higher-frequency sounds aren’t piercing. The profile misses finer details, but it's usually smooth. With less intricate hip-hop and rock tracks, it’s fine. For $15 beater earphones, it’s good.</p><p>Really, any cheap set of headphones you like could work as good set of beaters. The general sound quality of inexpensive earphones has risen over the years, with sub-$40 pairs like the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Nb29uZHJvcC1QZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1EeW5hbWljLUVhcnBob25lLVdpdGhvdXQvZHAvQjA5WEhWM1RDNj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby00eC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTMxZjgwM2UtZTc2Mi00YmM3LWFiNjItODg0NGQ4M2UxZTNlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAV5E9FZKfpKpatWwyPrSogD61isyqaYXRsOA8_Gttu4N&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMoondrop-Performance-Dynamic-Earphone-Without%2Fdp%2FB09XHV3TC6">Moondrop Chu</a> and <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9MaW5zb3VsLURpYXBocmFnbS1EeW5hbWljLUVhcnBob25lLURldGFjaGFibGUvZHAvQjA3WEtUUjg0OT90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTR4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlMzFmODAzZS1lNzYyLTRiYzctYWI2Mi04ODQ0ZDgzZTFlM2UifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdaz03r_JfjLJrgP9k83odXaXabUPmiUa75rCteO_zZU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLinsoul-Diaphragm-Dynamic-Earphone-Detachable%2Fdp%2FB07XKTR849%3Fth%3D1">BLON BL-03</a> earning <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/moondrop-chu-review-79486/">praise</a> from <a href="https://crinacle.com/2020/01/16/blon-bl03-review-beyond-the-hype/">reviewers</a> as of late.

## The Evercade EXP handheld brings key improvements but it's still a curious concept

<p>When we tried the original <a href="https://www.engadget.com/evercade-retro-handheld-hands-on-133010341.html"><ins>Evercade handheld</ins></a>, it was a fun-but-curious concept. Old games on a new handheld with <em>cartridges</em>? Nostalgia squared, basically. Whether you thought it was a good idea or not, there are now almost 40 collections available totalling hundreds of games. There’s also the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/evercade-vs-retro-home-console-review-130025234.html"><ins>VS home-console</ins></a> for playing against friends on the big screen. Now, there’s the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/evercade-exp-annoucement-193151272.html"><ins>Evercade EXP</ins></a> ($130/£150), a revamped handheld that improves on the original in some key ways. Evercade’s wacky idea, then, seems to be working.</p><p>In a curious turn of events, and potential further proof of its popularity, it seems a literal truck-load of EXP consoles <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-500k-of-evercade-stock-reported-stolen-in-terrible-potentially-organised-attack"><ins>have been stolen</ins></a>. Blaze, the company behind Evercade, has stated that it's working to restart production to replace the missing handhelds, so if you preordered one, you might want to check the <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/important-annoucement-evercade-exp-limited-editon-units-stolen-in-robbery/"><ins>company website</ins></a> for more information.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The EXP brings with it an improved, 800×480 display - more than double the resolution of the original (480x272). Games look much sharper this time around, though it’s still 4.3-inches diagonally which feels a little undersized for really any type of handheld device in 2022. Though there literally is more actual power with a new 1.5Ghz processor and a larger battery that’s good for about five hours of play.</p><figure><img alt="Rear view of the Evercade EXP retro gaming handheld." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/dc3bcae0-77b7-11ed-9f5f-3a8ffdbfd1ad" style="height: 1333; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The new all-white design gives the EXP a bit more of a grown up vibe than the original which looked a little toyish. The D-pad is particularly eye-catching, as it’s a large disc and almost looks like it protrudes from the casing a little too much. In use it’s fine, but something a little smaller and lower profile might add to the quality feel. The buttons, for example, are nice and clicky and are just the right height. It’s a slightly mixed combo but functional though moves in fighting games can be a little tricky to pull off sometimes.</p><p>One of the main perks with the EXP are the built-in games from Capcom. The console also comes with the Irem Arcade 1 collection which features six games (including <em>R-Type</em>) but the real fun is among those Capcom classics such as <em>Street Fighter II Hyper Fighting</em>, <em>Mega Man</em>, <em>Ghouls and Ghosts</em> and <em>Breath of Fire</em> (among others). These are some solid titles that mean there are 24 games available to play right out of the box.</p><p>If that’s not enough for day one, there’s also a way to expand this number even further to 29 thanks to a large banner on the home screen titled “HIDDEN GAMES” (it’s in all caps yep). This is a carry over from the VS that introduced a “Secret” menu option – which, despite the name, is not hidden, it’s right there in the main menu and it’s literally called “Secret.” Here, you can enter some codes and unlock even more games. No spoilers here, but a bit of googling around might turn up some clues.</p><p>Unfortunately, even though you can connect the EXP to a TV over HDMI and there’s a USB-C port on the bottom, you can’t connect a controller – not even a VS controller – to enjoy two player mode on the built-in games. This is a real shame with <em>Street Fighter II </em>sitting right there, begging to be played as nature intended. Blaze told Engadget that it’s something being explored but there’s nothing immediate to share. Games on the VS console can all be played in 2-player mode, but the license with Capcom only really allowed the company to include the games on the EXP itself, not as cartridges.</p><figure><img alt="Evercade EXP retro gaming handheld" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/12db6790-77b8-11ed-b7fd-f7b787374b5b" style="height: 1333; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The final main update on the EXP over the original is the inclusion of “Tate” mode. Many of those early arcade games were played in portrait, rather than landscape mode and the EXP has a pair of extra buttons beside the D-pad so you can flip the console 90-degrees and play these titles vertically just like back when quarters were required. Some of the included Capcom titles, such as <em>1942 </em>and <em>Commando</em>, use this mode, as do many on the bundled Irem Arcade cartridge. It’s nice to see these games with the option to play them in the right orientation and will be of particular appeal to fans of vertical scrolling shooters (of which there are plenty on the Evercade platform).</p><p>Finally, the EXP sports a newer user interface than the original. In fact, it’s borrowed almost directly from the VS console. The original handheld was updated to bring a similar-looking interface, but it’s a little lacking compared to that on the VS and EXP. It’s simple and easy to navigate but also has some useful added data in each game’s menu where you can see the how often and for how long you’ve played a game among other information. You can also set a “coin” limit here for truly re-creating that ‘90s arcade experience where you only had seven quarters and had to use them wisely.</p><figure><img alt="Evercade EXP retro gaming handheld" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/25142b40-77b8-11ed-b6eb-8ef250e5fc52" style="height: 1235; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Most of all, the EXP maintains the same authenticity and nods to the retro era that made the original and the VS more fun. Things like secret games and things to unlock were a mainstay of that era, so combined with the nostalgia of cartridges it all goes a long way to making the Evercade platform something beyond just another way to play old titles. There’s even a “game of the month” program that offers the chance to play forthcoming releases for a limited time free of charge.</p><p>It’s not all about vintage games, though. Evercade already has an <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/cartridges/indie-heroes-collection-1-cartridge/"><ins>indie collection</ins></a> of modern retro games, including the very recommendable Game Boy game <a href="https://www.engadget.com/deadeus-original-horror-game-boy-150040973.html"><em><ins>Deadeus</ins></em></a>. There’s a <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/cartridges/indie-heroes-collection-2/"><ins>second collection</ins></a> on the way, too. Old classics are one thing, but there are many ways to play them. Evercade provides a nice, legal option and one that compensates the rights owners appropriately, but it’s also well positioned to become a destination for modern retro and lighter indie titles.</p><p>There are a lot of options for retro games, whether that’s other handhelds, things like Nintendo’s virtual console/Switch online or the semi-recent trend of “mini” consoles. Evercade’s approach is unique but obviously requires a bit of a collector’s itch or a penchant for the lesser-known gems for it to really make sense. One thing’s for sure, there’s already <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2d66651e-658e-4baa-bc4e-ded0c126e805&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Portal+from+Facebook&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZDY2NjUxZS02NThlLTRiYWEtYmM0ZS1kZWQwYzEyNmU4MDUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmFjZWJvb2suY29tL2V2ZXJjYWRlcmV0cm8vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMzkwNGE0Mi03ZjBjLTQ0NTYtYTU1ZS0xYjhhODcyNjkzNjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAV6NvhqUO772c6jZ36wEhMM4Hv0nLhA_PKSUKGFvczpu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fevercaderetro%2F"><ins>a community</ins></a> gathering around the platform and for them and the like, the EXP elevates the handheld experience nicely.</p>

## Square Enix's 'Forspoken' demo is now available on PlayStation Network

<p>You can now play Square Enix's action RPG <em>Forspoken</em> after several launch delays — as a demo, that is. The developer and publisher has released a demo for the PS5 game on the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi5jb20vZW4tdXMvZ2FtZXMvZm9yc3Bva2VuLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGU1NjlkYjMtZjg3MC00YzE2LWI3YTEtZmM5ZjE2ZTkzNjVkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcmgW6fIFALQa059uC_7upD9kmhwgKu2SxoYTgCpruLa&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fforspoken%2F">PlayStation Store</a> at this years Game Awards, where it also announced that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xvi-release-date-040342103.html"><em>Final Fantasy XVI</em></a> will be available for Sony's current-gen console on June 22nd, 2023.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Forspoken</em> was originally supposed to be released in May, but it got pushed back to October 11th and then <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-delays-forspoken-january-24-2023-pc-ps5-180706295.html">again to January 24th </a>next year. It looks like Square Enix truly is gearing up for the game's release this time, now that we're just a bit over a month before its latest launch schedule. The game puts you in control of Frey Holland, a woman from New York City who's transported to another world called "Athia," where she gains magical abilities. There, she must find her way home while battling monsters and the Tantas, who were once "benevolent matriarchs [that] now rule the lands as evil and maddened sorceresses."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Square Enix says the demo will give you a "deeper look at the devastating effects of the Break," which is the powerful force responsible for corrupting everything it touches, the Tantas included. <em>Forspoken</em> will also be available on PC via Steam, Epic Games and the Microsoft Store, but the demo only seems to be available for the PS5. If you don't have access to the console, you can also watch the game's new trailer below:</p><div id="2df97ee2500d48e89b44320aed41ea81"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p>

## DJI's Mini 3 drone is cheaper, but more limited than the Pro model it's based on

<p>You'd think that after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-avata-cinewhoop-drone-130014973.html">launching</a> a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/dji/">ton of products</a> in 2022, DJI would be finished for the year.

It's a stripped down version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-avata-cinewhoop-drone-130014973.html">Mini 3 Pro</a>, with no forward or rear obstacle detection, no <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmRqaS5jb20vZ3VpZGVzL2ZpbG0tbGlrZS1hLXByby13aXRoLWFjdGl2ZXRyYWNrLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGJhY2E0YjgtMDJkMS00MmFlLTg0NTMtMTQ2M2ZjZTVhMjc1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAUcmf6ChXM3e_8wnRi2m3gSqRx-Kfm5i8beBslIZjL_P&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.dji.com%2Fguides%2Ffilm-like-a-pro-with-activetrack%2F">ActiveTrack</a> and video that's limited to 4K 30p. Those compromises are reflected in the price, meaning you'll pay $469 for just the drone compared to $669 for the Mini 3 Pro.&nbsp;</p><p>The company believes the Mini 3 Pro is ideal for first time users, in scenarios like "suburban outings, holiday travel, and urban shooting/exploration with family and friends." In that sense, it's more a spiritual successor to the DJI Mini 2 than a Mini 3 Pro-lite. That said, it's nearly identical to the Mini 3 Pro, apart from the front sensors being removed and replaced with grills and smooth plastic where the rear sensors would be located on the Pro.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Mini 3 weighs less than 249 grams so it doesn't require a special permit to fly in many countries. It has the same <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/4159871805/making-sensor-sizes-less-misleading">Type 1/1.3 (9.6 x 7.2 mm)</a> f/1.7 sensor as the Mini 3 Pro, so you can film in 4K HDR and take 12-megapixel photos. However, video is limited to 4K 30p, rather than 4K 60p on the more expensive model. It also offers "true vertical" video and photo shooting, with the camera flips 90 degrees to allow for high quality social media content.&nbsp;</p><p>DJI has ensured 2.7K and full HD captures max out at 60fps, so there's no 120fps as found on the Mini 3 Pro. You can shoot HDR at up to 30fps, and it has dual native ISO for decent low-light performance in a relatively small sensor.&nbsp;</p><p>The Intelligent Flight Batteries provide long flight times, delivering up to 38 minutes with the standard and 51 minutes with the extended batteries (the latter are available in North America but not in Europe and other regions). Those times are under ideal conditions; you'll more likely see around 30-32 minutes. Still, that's excellent for this category and provides a cushion for beginners who may let the drone fly a bit too far away. Despite the small size it has "robust power," DJI says, which helps it handle reasonably stiff winds as well.</p><p>As with the Mini 3 Pro, you can get the Mini 3 with DJI's RC controller for an extra $230. That option is well worth it, because it's far more convenient than using a smartphone with the regular RC-N1 controller. It has a similar layout to DJI's other controllers, with the addition of photo and video triggers that automatically switch between those respective modes. The RC controller joysticks can be stowed underneath the controller chassis for travel and while the screen struggles a bit in bright sunlight, it is otherwise sharp and clear.</p><figure><img alt="DJI's Mini 3 drone is cheaper, but more limited than the Pro model it's based on" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/9aab8c80-77a0-11ed-b7fd-d4003b48802d" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Mini 3 has a key feature for social media users, namely DJI's QuickShots. That lets you take short and cute videos without the need to pilot, as the drone does all the work. Some of those include "Dronie" (starting tight on the subject and flying up and away to reveal the background) and "Circle," where the camera moves around the subject.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it lacks many of the AI features found on the Mini 3 Pro like ActiveTrack (following a subject), Timelapse and Mastershots. The fact that it can track a subject with QuickShots suggests that its capable of ActiveTrack, but that the functionality may simply be disabled.</p><p>It has other intelligent functions to help beginners. Those include Auto Takeoff, Return to Home (RTH) including Smart RTH, Low Battery RTH and Failsafe RTH, instructing the aircraft to return to its starting point if the battery is low or signal drops.&nbsp;</p><section><img alt="DJI's Mini 3 drone is cheaper, but more limited than the Pro model it's based on" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/ca812f50-77a0-11ed-bdee-68c398520f89" /></section><p>That brings us to one big issue with this drone. It does feature a downward vision system and infrared sensing for stable hovering, which is a big help for novice users. However, it lacks forward and rear obstacle detection sensors. That means a user can fly it directly into a tree or building more easily, and as it doesn't have DJI <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-avata-fpv-drone-review-133020277.html">Avata-like</a> propeller protection, you could end up with a broken drone. Even if you're careful, using the RTH function could be risky as the drone could automatically fly itself into an object when trying to navigate home. You'll also want to make sure the area is clear when doing a Dronie or other Quickshots maneuver.&nbsp;</p><p>I received the Mini 3 from DJI, but it was a bit too late to do a video (we'll release a full review soon). However, my drone pilot friend and I had a day to test it, and we found it just as stable and easy to fly as the Mini 3 Pro. The footage quality looks sharp and clear with accurate colors, and I didn't really miss the 4K 60p, as I don't often use that mode anyway.</p><p>We were acutely aware of the lack of obstacle sensors, though. We didn't dare wander too far away from base, as a loss of signal could be disastrous — particularly in Europe where laws restrict the transmission distance significantly compared to the US. The lack of sensors also limit what you can shoot, as it would be foolhardy to get it too close to obstacles or fly in tight spaces.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="DJI Mini 3 drone galler" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/db034ce0-77a1-11ed-97df-953d385b6a7b" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Lastly, I'm wondering about the Mini 3's pricing. If you don't already have a DJI drone, you'll need to pay $559 with the RC-N1 controller, compared to $759 for the Mini 3 Pro. The Fly More Combo (two extra batteries, RC-N1 controller, three-battery charger) costs $718, compared to $948 for the Mini 3 Pro. The Fly More Combo with the RC controller is $858, while the same kit for the Pro model is $1,098.</p><p>If you're just having fun or starting out and only need a battery, drone and controller, $559 might be a bit steep for many folks. For just a minor stepdown in capability, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ESkktTWluaS1VbHRyYWxpZ2h0LVF1YWRjb3B0ZXItVHJhbnNtaXNzaW9uL2RwL0IwOEpHWUY1VzE_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tYnctMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRiYWNhNGI4LTAyZDEtNDJhZS04NDUzLTE0NjNmY2U1YTI3NSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeRBSqiKAa_n1bm8R_w-CKudOzYEyspOjqPJTVuAofvD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDJI-Mini-Ultralight-Quadcopter-Transmission%2Fdp%2FB08JGYF5W1">Mini 2 is just $449</a> in the same configuration, for instance. And, if you want a more serious kit with more batteries and possibly the RC controller, it would make sense to cough up $240 more to get the Pro.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, the Mini 3 Pro is perpetually out of stock, so this one will probably sell like hotcakes regardless of my misgivings. So far it looks like an easy-to-fly drone that takes better video than anything else in this price range — just keep it it well away from obstacles.</p>

<p>The Game Awards gave us a busy night for gaming news.. First up, Idris Elba will star in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s first big DLC. <em>Phantom Liberty</em> is a spy thriller introducing a new character, FIA agent Solomon Reed, played by Elba. The DLC also includes new missions and a new district in Night City, all of it culminating in &quot;an impossible mission of espionage and survival,&quot; according to developer CD Projekt RED. I wonder if he’ll bump into Keanu Reeves’ character.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-dlc-2023-idris-elba-040650842.html"><figure><img alt="TMA" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/172f7c42-77b4-11ed-bff7-a06884963be8" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CD Projekt RED</div></figure></a><p>A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hades-ii-early-access-2023-supergiant-014058252.html"><em>Hades</em> sequel</a> might be the biggest reveal.

## Riot Games sues Chinese tech giant NetEase for making a 'copy' of Valorant

<p>Riot Games has sued Chinese tech giant NetEase, calling its mobile game <em>Hyper Front</em> &quot;a copy of substantial parts of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valorant-swiftplay-shorter-game-mode-145436893.html"><em>Valorant</em></a>,&quot; <a href="https://www.law360.com/ip/articles/1554118/riot-games-sues-china-tech-giant-over-video-game-copy-"><em>Law360</em></a> has reported. On top of matching the format, NetEase also replicated parts of its character designs, game maps, weapon designs and more, Riot claims. It brought the case to the high court of England and Wales, but is also launching complaints in Germany, Brazil and Singapore, according to<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23500704/riot-games-netease-lawsuit-valorant-hyper-front"><em>Polygon</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Like <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Hyper Front</em> is a free-to-play first-person shooter that pits teams of five against each other in different modes. In its claim, Riot noted that Hyper Front began development shortly after it revealed an early of Valorant dubbed &quot;Project A&quot; in October of 2019. NetEase, meanwhile, showed off a beta version of <em>Hyper Front</em> under the code name &quot;Project M.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The release of <em>Hyper Front </em>in Singapore and other countries prompted complaints from users that it was essentially a &quot;copy&quot; of <em>Valorant</em>. That led to NetEase making modifications to the games, but the level of infringement goes beyond that, Riot said. The modified version of <em>Hyper Front</em> is currently available on Android and iOS stores, boasting more than one million downloads and 48,000+ reviews on Google Play.&nbsp;</p><p>NetEase is currently involved in a dispute with Korea's PUBG corp. over two NetEase mobile games. Earlier this year, two California judges said NetEase faced an &quot;<a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1482884/netease-faces-uphill-battle-in-gaming-ip-appeal-judges-say">uphill battle</a>&quot; in challenging a settlement agreement with PUBG. Meanwhile, Riot Games <a href="https://www.engadget.com/riot-games-settles-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-100049078.html">recently settled</a> a class-action gender discrimination lawsuit for $100 million.&nbsp;</p>

## SpaceX's first civilian lunar mission will take BIGBANG'S T.O.P and DJ Steve Aoki to the Moon

<p>Japanese billionaire <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-18-who-is-yusaku-maezawa-spacexs-first-lunar-tourist.html">Yusaku Maezawa</a> has picked his companions for SpaceX's first all-civilian mission to the Moon over a year after he <a href="https://www.engadget.com/yusaku-maezawa-open-invite-to-the-moon-043940638.html">put out a call</a> for potential private astronauts. He <a href="https://dearmoon.earth/">chose eight crew members</a> and two backups from various backgrounds to be part of the mission called &quot;dearMoon,&quot; and while application was open to everyone, some of the names will likely stand out when you review the list. One of the people flying with Maezawa on SpaceX's Starship spacecraft is Choi Seung Hyun, better known as T.O.P. from the Korean boy band BIGBANG.&nbsp;</p><p>DJ Steve Aoki is also part of the crew, as well as Tim Dodd, who's known for creating space-themed content as a photographer and host of YouTube channel <em>Everyday Astronaut</em>. The other crew members include Rhiannon Adam, a photographic artist from Ireland who now works in London and the US, and Yemi A.D., a designer, director, choreographer and non-profit org founder from the Czech Republic. Brendan Hall, a filmmaker who directed projects for <em>National Geographic</em>, Karim Iliya, a filmmaker who documents whales, birds and other threatened species, and Dev D. Joshi, an actor from India, round up the main crew list. Meanwhile, snowboarding Olympic gold medalist Kaitlyn Farrington and Japanese dancer Miyu were named as backup crew.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Maezawa said the project received about a million applications from interested individuals around the world who went through a strict selection process. The inclusion of musicians and other creatives doesn't come as a surprise, since the billionaire originally intended to bring artists with him on the trip in hopes that it would inspire them to create something that promotes world peace. He didn't say why he chose T.O.P. specifically, but the rapper did don a spacesuit for one of BIGBANG's music videos.</p><div id="95f9d328a1634bde8f547da2c2844c80"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The dearMoon project was launched in 2018 after Maezawa purchased all the seats for a six-day trip to the Moon from SpaceX. It will fly a single circumlunar trajectory around Earth's faithful companion and is expected to take place sometime next year, though the actual date depends on Starship's development. To prepare for the dearMoon mission, Maezawa <a href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-iss-space-tourist-yusaku-maezawa-223016577.html">flew to the ISS</a> last year and spent 12 days on the flying lab shooting videos about life in space.&nbsp;</p><div id="b5833f2e796a456b972bbaa3531b800d"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p>

<p>Although <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/The%20Game%20Awards/">The Game Awards</a> didn't bring news of a major <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/elden%20ring/"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> expansion, there was another juicy announcement for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/fromsoftware/">FromSoftware</a> fans. The revered studio is bringing back the Armored Core series after a decade of dormancy. Best of all, you won't have to wait too long to get your hands on <em>Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon</em>. It's coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Steam in 2023.</p><p>From and publisher Bandai Namco announced the game with a trailer that shows mechs emerging from the embers of an apocalyptic event. The clip doesn't offer a ton of story details, but it doesn't have to. The footage is gorgeously detailed and richly rendered enough that the plot can easily take a back seat for now.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>What we do know is that you'll be able to assemble your own mech and freely explore the environment, seemingly with slow, steady movements. According to the Japanese version of the trailer's YouTube description, you'll be able to utilize more dynamic movements, fire weapons and engage in close combat when you battle enemies.&nbsp;</p><p>This will be the first mainline Armored Core game since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-01-12-armored-core-5-mechs-a-date-with-retail-march-20.html">2012's <em>Armored Core V</em></a> (a standalone expansion followed in 2013). After the mammoth success of <em>Elden Ring</em>, From has set its standards extremely high. But if any studio can clear that bar, it's probably this one.</p><div id="8121b31dea4540d49138b587270697ea"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p>

You can expect the usual round of new classes and some familiar game mechanics (such as <em>D2</em>'s skill trees), but the open world title now has more tactical depth, more experimentation and, crucially, a narrative that has a proper chance to unfold.

<p>At the Game Awards, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-game-studios-chief-mike-frazzini-is-stepping-down-120054965.html">Amazon Games</a> announced it will be publishing Bandai Namco’s forthcoming free-to-play online RPG, <em>Blue Protocol </em>in the west. A new teaser trailer offer views of the game's beautiful cel-shaded world, multiple character classes and weapons. It's an action RPG, with the ability to play both solo and cooperatively. You’ll apparently be able to participate in raids with up to 30 other players.</p><p>While the game will be coming to PC, Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, <em>Blue Protocol </em>is designed to be played on controllers, with aim-assist support for people not using a mouse and keyboard. In fact, each class will have different sliders to adjust controls for smoother playstyles. Talking of style, you’ll apparently be able to customize your character deeply, across hairstyles, clothing accessories and even mounts – yes you’ll have your own fantasy steed a little like<em> Pokemon Legends Arceus</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ebb947d6ec4e4bccb58250a37b61f88c"></div><p>You’ll be able to pick from five classes at launch. The Blade Warden uses both a sword and shield, a Twin Striker that excels at short-range damage with double axes and the Keen Strider is an agile class with bow-based long-range attacks and area effects. Rounding out the lineup, the  Spell Weaver is your magic wielder, while Foe Breaker has a massive hammer and can even fire a short-range cannonball. <em>Somehow</em>.</p><p>It’s 2022, so while you will be able to play the whole story without spending, there will be cosmetic upgrades available to buy, as well as features that will apparently help play the game. I get the feeling there’s more than a little inspiration gleaned from <em>Genshin Impact</em>, the free-to-play action RPG that’s been extremely lucrative for its creators – and a huge global hit. It’ll be intriguing to see how Bandai Namco’s new game compares. It’s also an unusual team-up with Amazon Games.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the press release, <em>Blue Protocol</em> will be the “latest title in Amazon Games’ portfolio of high-quality live service games” including <em>New World, </em>an MMORPG – which makes some sense. Perhaps Amazon Games can offer some insight into ensuring <em>Blue Protocol</em> runs smoothly from a technical standpoint. The game is now set to launch in the second half of 2023, but expect a closed beta to run early next year. You’ll be able to sign up for that soon, online.</p>

In <em>Earthblade</em>, you'll play Névoa, which the developer describes as an &quot;enigmatic child of Fate&quot; (with horns) who's returning to Earth. The trailer shows you some of the obstacles you'll have to face and the foes you'll have to defeat while exploring the remnants of a ruined world. Extremely OK also says you'll be piecing together Earth's fractured history as you play.&nbsp;</p><p>We wouldn't be surprised if you have high expectations for <em>Earthblade</em>, seeing as <em>Celeste</em> had won several awards after it was launched. At The Game Awards in 2018, it won best independent release of the year.

<p>Hideo Kojima's next project is <em>Death Stranding 2</em>. The reveal trailer for the sequel shows Fragile, played by Léa Seydoux, and Sam, played by Norman Reedus, in a world still infested with lethal BTs. There's no word on a release date, but according to the trailer's YouTube description, it's heading to PlayStation 5.&nbsp;</p><p>Kojima took the stage during The Game Awards to introduce <em>Death Stranding 2</em>. Its cast is just as star-studded as the original, featuring Elle Fanning, Shioli Kutsuna and Troy Baker alongside Reedus and Seydoux.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="96a4aa8fb5e646678c022d2f533cfdc7"></div><p><em>Death Stranding</em> came out in 2019 and it steadily became the industry's favorite walking simulator (despite the fact that it may have been a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-death-stranding-is-a-great-movie.html">better movie than a video game</a>). By the end of 2022, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/death-stranding-10-million-players-231135533.html">more than 10 million people</a> had played <em>Death Stranding</em>. Its primary gameplay innovation was an online system that allowed players to communicate with each other, even though it was a single-player experience. <em>Death Stranding</em> was the first title out of Kojima Productions, the studio Kojima himself founded after parting ways with his longtime employer, Konami.&nbsp;</p><p>Ahead of The Game Awards on December 8th, Kojima <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1600596136632279040">tweeted</a> some teases for the show, including an image that <a href="https://twitter.com/CFCJoji/status/1600642556139814920">seemed to be</a> Fragile from <em>Death Stranding</em>. The tweet included the text, &quot;How come?&quot; and Kojima added, &quot;'WHO' 'WHERE' 'HOW' and now 'WHY'.&quot;</p><p>We now know <em>what</em> Kojima was talking about — not that he asked.</p><p>Footage of what appeared to be Kojima's next project leaked online in early November in the form of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hideo-kojima-overdose-leak-death-stranding-margaret-qualley-154257824.html">a super strange video</a>. It showed a character resembling Mama from <em>Death Stranding</em> traversing creepy corridors with a dark presence at her back, and ended with a title screen reading, &quot;Overdose.&quot; It also included the reflection of a lounging shirtless man recording the footage off-screen, but that's likely unrelated to any gameplay mechanics. Today at The Game Awards, Kojima said his studio is also working on a second, completely new project with an experimental edge, so there's still some hope for whatever this was.</p>

## Rocksteady's Suicide Squad game (hopefully) arrives May 26th, 2023

<p>Rocksteady's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rocksteady-suicide-squad-game-005154513.html">long-in-the-making</a><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> game finally has a firm release date. The studio has <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1601030711296724992">revealed</a> that its villains-doing-good title will be available on May 26th, 2023. And, as the trailer below shows, it will be memorable for more than just gameplay. This is the curtain call for one of voice acting's best-known stars.</p><p>The upcoming game will have the Suicide Squad take on Batman, voiced by none other than the late Kevin Conroy. This is his last turn as the iconic hero, and it's an interesting twist at that. Like Superman and other major DC Comics champions, Batman has gone bad — enough so that he's breaking one of his cardinal rules. Naturally, it's up to Harley Quinn, Deadshot, King Shark and Captain Boomerang to deal with the Dark Knight.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="9f12a72438bb48348816caa87dfa6cf3"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The game is headed to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. It's too early to say if this will live up to the reputation Rocksteady made for itself with the <em>Arkham</em> Batman games. However, <em>Suicide Squad</em> will have been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rocksteady-suicide-squad-video-game-delay-151834338.html">delayed three years</a> by the time it (presumably) arrives.

<p>Ghost Story Games has revealed its first title nearly six years after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/bioshock/">BioShock</a> creator Ken Levine founded the studio. A trailer for <em>Judas </em>debuted at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/The%20Game%20Awards/">The Game Awards</a> and while it's not an actual BioShock game, it draws from that series' art style.

According to a description on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/388860/Judas/">the game's Steam page</a>, &quot;your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="1ef3cd01dada406d94fac21393d7157a"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-03/bioshock-creator-s-next-game-and-its-narrative-legos-in-turmoil"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>reported earlier this year that the game had been stuck in development hell for several years amid multiple reboots and Levine changing the direction of the project multiple times. But Levine <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-01-28-ken-levine-hints-at-new-first-person-sci-fi-adventure.html">suggested back in 2015</a> that his next game would be a sci-fi first-person shooter, and <em>Judas</em> at least fits that bill.

Now, you'll no longer need a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-verified-5000-compatiblity-201412211.html">Steam Deck</a> or Xbox Cloud Gaming access to play it anywhere or at any time.&nbsp;</p><p>As spotted by <em>Polygon</em>, <em>Vampire Survivors </em>has suddenly arrived on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vampire-survivors/id6444525702">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.poncle.vampiresurvivors">Google Play Store</a>. Unlike the myriad clones that have popped up on both stores throughout the year, this is the real deal. What's more, the mobile versions are free — <em>Vampire Survivors</em> costs $5 on Steam and it's included with Game Pass.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The timing suggests that the mobile release was going to be a surprise announcement at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-watch-the-game-awards-stream-start-time-220021184.html">The Game Awards</a>. Perhaps we'll hear word of PlayStation and Nintendo Switch versions soon too.</p><p>For the uninitiated, <em>Vampire Survivors</em> asks you to choose a character with a locked starter weapon and perk, then sends you out into the <em>Castlevania</em>-inspired world to face an endless stream of enemies (but no vampires, oddly) and stay alive as long as you can. Your weapons auto-fire and all you have control over is your movement and the ability to choose a weapon, perk or upgrade when you level up. It's immensely enjoyable, and you can download it on your phone, <em>gratis,</em> right now. In addition, you can play the mobile versions in vertical or horizontal mode.</p><p>Meanwhile, developer Poncle will release the first paid <em>Vampire Survivors</em> expansion on December 15th. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vampire-survivors-dlc-legacy-of-moonspell-194536374.html"><em>Legacy of Moonspell</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>will cost $2 on Steam and Xbox. It wouldn't be a surprise to see the DLC pop up on the iOS and Android versions as well.</p>
