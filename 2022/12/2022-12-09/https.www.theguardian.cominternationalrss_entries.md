## Argentina edge Netherlands in shootout to win World Cup quarter-final thriller

<p>It was fiery, it was fractious, it descended into utter bedlam, simply a World Cup knockout tie for the ages. Argentina went to hell and back, collapsing deep into second-half stoppage time to squander a two-goal lead after Louis van Gaal’s substitutions combined to wreak havoc. But after a fraught period of extra time Argentina came out on top of a ludicrous bout, with Lautaro Martínez scoring the decisive spot-kick in a penalty shootout victory. Lionel Messi’s magical assist and penalty for his 10th World Cup goal, to equal Gabriel Batistuta’s record, finished as footnotes.</p><p>Argentina had to suffer and then some but Martínez kept his cool. Argentina had appeared in control but the arrival of Weghorst, a 6ft 6in striker who joined Besiktas on loan from Burnley in the summer, with 78 minutes on the clock undeniably changed the game. With seconds of 10 minutes of second-half stoppage time to play, two of Argentina’s substitutes, German Pezzella and Leandro Paredes, whose poor challenge on Nathan Aké brought a first melee approaching the end of normal time, were lured into sandwiching Weghorst on the edge of the box as the trio contested an aerial ball. And then the Dutch got inventive. Teun Koopmeiners, also a late substitute, shaped to shoot from the subsequent free-kick but instead cannoned the ball into the feet of Weghorst, who rolled his marker and promptly prodded the ball into the far corner.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/09/netherlands-argentina-world-cup-quarter-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Brazil have had their last dance.

Bruno Petkovic’s equaliser, as the clock ticked down, had not seemed likely but you can never write them off; penalties ensued and Dominik Livakovic, the hero against Japan, saved the first from Rodrygo. When Marquinhos hit the post, with Croatia having been on point four times, the outcome was settled. A side inspired by Luka Modric, who dragged them around the pitch during their eighth extra-time period in nine knockout ties, cannot be discounted from going all the way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/09/croatia-brazil-world-cup-quarter-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Project Mbappé: the making of France’s football superstar

<p>The plan was always to make Kylian Mbappé the world’s best player but it was done with warmth and good advice instead of pressure</p><p>There have been points this week when it has seemed that England were not about to face a team in the World Cup quarter-final on Saturday, but a single player. Kylian Mbappé has dominated the plotline like Diego Maradona did in the past and Cristiano Ronaldo wished he could do in the present.</p><p>The France forward already has five goals to his credit in this World Cup, to add to the four he scored in Russia four years ago. Nine in total – that’s one more than Maradona and the same as Ballon d’Or winners Eusébio and Paolo Rossi. He could still be on his way to becoming a double world champion before reaching his 24th birthday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/09/project-mbappe-the-making-of-frances-football-superstar">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Statistics show the effects of building pressure as the shootout goes on and pinpoint the one most likely to be missed</p><p>According to Maxime Bossis, it was an error that would never have been made these days. “No one told me he always dived on the same side. It was another world,” said the former France defender <a href="https://tribunenantaise.fr/actus-fcnantes/maxime-bossis-revient-avec-emotion-sur-lun-des-matchs-les-plus-dramatiques-du-football-francais/">in an interview</a> in July. “Today a coach or a player would have come to tell me: ‘Watch out, he always dives to his right!”</p><p>It is more than 40 years since Bossis entered the history books as the first player whose miss in a World Cup penalty shootout led – via an opponent’s successful spot-kick – to his country’s elimination. Introduced by Fifa for the 1982 tournament in Spain to replace the policy of replaying a drawn game, the first took place in Seville and saw – you guessed it – West Germany emerge victorious against France.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/09/world-cup-penalty-shootouts-by-numbers">Continue reading...</a>

The commissioner is of the opinion that such distortions of human rights as a zero-sum game between different groups must be vigorously rejected.</p><p>There is unanimity across the government in that it wants high inflation to be temporary, and I think there is understanding that that is essential for the very people who are feeling most angry about their situation.</p><p>We have to be really careful not to agree to pay demands that have the opposite of the intended effect because they lock in high inflation.</p><p>So if we make the wrong choices now, we won’t have that 3.7% of inflation in January or February of 2024 and this will change from being a one-off problem, to being a permanent problem, which will be the worst possible thing for people working in public services.

<p>Childcare in the UK is rising faster than inflation – so what’s going wrong? Economist Christine Farquharson explains</p><p>The UK has some of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/sep/12/how-do-uk-childcare-costs-stack-up-against-the-best" title="">highest childcare costs</a> in the world, increasingly forcing women out of the workplace. I asked Christine Farquharson, from the Institute of Fiscal Studies, why.</p><p><strong>Being a woman in her 30s, I’d rank childcare costs before bloating, but after climate</strong><strong> in the list of “routinely discussed horrors”. It’s hard to make sense of.</strong><br />Looking after young children is expensive. In the UK, we have a childcare ratio of one adult to a maximum of three under-twos. If you divide the minimum wage – £9.50 an hour for over-23s – by three, you’re looking at north of £3 an hour per child. It’s labour-intensive, and that makes it expensive. Then add rent, energy, etc.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/09/why-is-childcare-so-expensive-we-ask-an-expert">Continue reading...</a>

<p>By focusing on the near-future of the industry, the honours failed to adequately celebrate its present</p><p>The high point of the <a href="https://youtu.be/qVEgq182Eq0">ninth annual Game awards</a> arrived within its first 15 minutes. A charmingly unkempt Al Pacino arrived on stage to present the award for best performance, quickly admitting that he neither played “a whole lot of video games” nor could read the teleprompter especially well. Still, he managed to hand the gong out to actor Christopher Judge for his electrifying performance as Kratos in God of War Ragnarök. Dressed in a sparkling gold suit, Judge began his moment in the sun by hugging the Hollywood star. This was just the start of a further 10 heartfelt minutes on stage, the actor relaying the personal anguish he went through leading up to the game’s production. As the minutes wore on, the show’s producers seemingly began to fret about the night’s schedule, eventually playing orchestral music in an attempt to hurry him along. Yet this only made Judge’s words more epic – all the more affecting.</p><p>Judge’s time on stage was a rare moment of spontaneity and personality in a three-hour awards show otherwise sorely lacking these ingredients. Creator, host, and producer Geoff Keighley, had promised a “<a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1600888902033715200?s=20&amp;t=Y8XXvKkKf4zQ7esnLLGf3Q">streamlined</a>” runtime compared with its predecessors, and so Judge’s extended appearance left less time for other winners. However, this year’s glitzy event continued to show the extent to which the Game awards lack balance. The length of time given to the awards and their winners was dwarfed by that allocated for what the show calls “world premiere” trailers of new and announced games. The awards should be a celebration of the year’s interactive excellence yet the evening demonstrated the extent to which it remains fixated on a hype-filled future, often to the detriment of the creators it purports to recognise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/dec/09/the-game-awards-three-patience-testing-hours-of-video-game-advertorials">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From learning to flush loos in fake nails, to acting like her face was frozen by cosmetics, taking on the trial of the century wasn’t easy. Ex-Harry Potter actor and wildling Natalia Tena tells all</p><p></p><p>The Wagatha Christie trial was easily the most high-profile court case of 2022. You didn’t need to follow football to know who Rebekah Vardy was; you didn’t have to be on Instagram to know that Coleen Rooney, suspecting someone was selling nuggets from her personal life to the Sun, smoked out the culprit by fabricating a story, restricting her follower count to one person – Vardy – then waiting for it to hit the showbiz pages. The whole escapade had so many dimensions – suspense, panto, bitter enmity – and played so well in a culture that routinely pries into the lives of footballers’ wives and girlfriends, that by the time Vardy brought her astonishing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/29/rebekah-vardy-loses-libel-case-against-coleen-rooney-wagatha-christie">libel case against</a> Rooney, there can’t have been anyone in the country who wasn’t getting in the popcorn and waiting for the self-sabotage to play out.</p><p>Well, turns out there was one person: Natalia Tena, who now plays Vardy in Channel 4’s Vardy v Rooney: A Courtroom Drama with a self-respect that dignifies the whole saga. “I didn’t know who these women were at all,” the 38-year-old actor tells me in a restaurant in London’s King’s Cross. She’s openly vaping indoors so I already love her, but I don’t quite believe her. “Seriously?” I ask. “But they’re so famous.

<p>Tonally perfect, exquisitely funny and hugely moving, the final series of Lisa McGee’s comedy about growing up in 90s Northern Ireland was a masterpiece</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/02/the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2022">The 50 best TV shows of 2022</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/2022-in-culture">More of the best culture of 2022</a></li></ul><p>‘I’m so fucking sick of peace!” And so, another of Michelle’s banging lines launched the third and best series of Derry Girls. While a second ceasefire was called, the girls (and yes, James, that includes you) spent the summer of 1997 making a “really quite shite” documentary about growing up Catholic in Northern Ireland. Ah, well. Maybe it wasn’t too late to make “a couple of fake videos for You’ve Been Framed” instead. Anyway, on to more pressing matters: GCSE results! Cue Bizarre Inc screeching “Why waste your time? / You know you’re gonna be mine.” Let the final series of Lisa McGee’s masterpiece begin!</p><p>Derry Girls is so tonally perfect, its farce so exquisitely timed, the 90s nostalgia so flawlessly pitched, the essence of teenage girlhood so lovingly distilled, that the impulse to relay each scene line by line, in the merciful-Jesus-kill-me-now manner of Uncle Colm, is impossible to resist. My intro only covers the first 60 seconds of series three – <em>that’s</em> how high the gag rate is. One has to pay the kind of close attention previously reserved for Line of Duty interrogations to catch every joke. Laugh too hard at the chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (played by Liam Neeson!) telling the wains that there are in fact three Catholics in the force if you include the lovely Jewish fella down Ballymena station, and you’re in danger of missing the epiphany that Sister Michael’s full name is … Sister George Michael. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/09/the-top-50-tv-shows-of-2022-no-9-derry-girls">Continue reading...</a>

These are poems stuffed full of the ghostly voices and tangled detritus of the past, that watch as seemingly firm structures, concepts and lives melt and give way to inevitable entropy: “There is no home or resting place. / The broken ground will have us all / Indifferently back.” This mournful collection also engages, albeit obliquely, with the grief caused by planetary crisis, describing a natural world that has lost its ability to comfort, and become bleak and threatening: “When the rooks / perform their barebones offices / the flinty blackness of their chant / strikes sparks from the bitter air.” In this poetic vision, the human becomes a solitary, vulnerable figure in a harsh, uncaring world: “While we are labouring, the sun / in all his arctic splendour / passes over, casting our shadows / like graves on the iron fields.” As the final poem has it, “times are evil” – and O’Brien’s desolate poetic voice matches that grim intensity.</p><p><strong>Liquid Flesh: New and Selected Poems by Brenda Shaughnessy (<a href="https://www.guardianbookshop.com/liquid-flesh-9781780376295?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">Bloodaxe, £14.99</a>)</strong><strong><br /></strong>This collection showcases Okinawan-Irish American poet Brenda Shaughnessy as one of contemporary poetry’s most original and important voices.

<p>Games have always been a vital part of Christmas. And thanks to smartphones and Switches, they’ve never been more accessible – or enjoyable</p><p>Games have always been an important part of the Christmas experience – whether we like it or not. Back in the middle ages, households gathered together in the bleak midwinter to play versions of blind man’s buff and truth or dare; Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night was inspired by a game played in aristocratic households where the masters and servants swapped roles for a night on the last day of Christmas. The Victorians were famous for their parlour games with charades and twenty questions as important to the 19th century experience of Christmas as roasted goose and rampant diphtheria.</p><p>During my own childhood in the 1970s and 1980s, board games ruled the festive period. Frankly, was it even Christmas until someone (me) flipped the dining room table during a particularly sociopathic game of Monopoly? Did everyone have that one uncle who took Trivial Pursuit too seriously – lambasting his terrified teammates for not knowing the chemical formula of sulphuric acid, while claiming the opponents were getting all the easy questions? Did everyone else immediately break Hungry Hungry Hippos?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/dec/09/the-guide-video-games-christmas-gifts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The oldest artist ever to win the Turner spent years feeling as if she was invisible.

In some ways, she has also had the hardest path to get here. In her winner’s speech in the grandeur of Liverpool’s St George’s Hall on Wednesday night, she thanked and named three lost siblings, Patricia, Josephine and David. When I ask about them, she tells me baldly: “They committed suicide.” There have been years of trauma and grief for the bereaved family to cope with. And other losses, too. Ryan’s career had a promising start, with plenty of opportunities and shows when she graduated from the Slade School of Fine Art. But that ground to a halt. It was almost as if she was swept away by the incoming tide of the Young British Artists, who were a few years younger than her. “There was a whole period,” she says, “when people wouldn’t show my work and wouldn’t even reply when I sent them images.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/dec/09/veronica-ryan-on-winning-the-turner-prize">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The midterms have been an endorsement of Biden’s formula: appeal to the middle by hammering at Republicans’ extremism</p><p>For the third time in a row, Democrats have won a Senate election in Georgia. Raphael Warnock’s victory makes it clear that the party’s gains in the state in 2020 were not an anomaly.

But in order for that to happen – and to build on their victories elsewhere – Democrats have to make the right choices.</p><p>Taken as a whole, the midterms have provided a ringing endorsement of the approach to politics favored by President Joe Biden.

<p>In an extract from his forthcoming book, Unkrich explains how, aged 13, he first saw the film which would inspire a lifelong passion</p><p>‘Are you OK? Is it too scary? We can leave if you need to …” It was May 1980. I was nearly 13 years old, sitting in an Ohio movie theatre with my mother watching Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining. She was right to be concerned; exactly two years earlier she had taken me to see Larry Cohen’s horror film It Lives Again – his sequel to It’s Alive – and the experience had caused more than a year of traumatic, recurring nightmares. As a result, I had since avoided any scary movies (or even their trailers). So it was risky for her to take me to see another horror film that early summer evening.</p><p>Little did she know that she was changing the course of my life. The Shining penetrated my psyche in a way I had never experienced, and it was intoxicating. Like Danny Torrance, I was an only child whose parents were entangled in a dysfunctional marriage. I also spent many hours home alone, my house filled with rich fodder for my imagination: a shadowy crawlspace, a statue of a little girl that I was certain was alive, and the insecurity and numb terror that comes from watching your parents’ marriage unravel.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/09/i-got-a-bit-drunk-with-the-twins-toy-story-2s-lee-unkrich-on-his-obsession-with-the-shining">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We pick five tactical areas key to the outcome, including Gareth Southgate’s choice of shape and France’s defensive weak spots</p><p>The pattern under Gareth Southgate has been that England play a back four when confident of dominating the ball and a back three when they expect possession to be more contested. In four games at this tournament so far, England have played 4-3-3. The question is whether, against France, they stick to the shape that has been effective or whether, mindful of the threat posed by, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/08/kyle-walker-warned-there-is-no-proven-formula-to-stop-frances-kylian-mbappe">particularly, Kylian Mbappé</a>, they opt for a back three. In September, Southgate spoke of how he had allowed himself in June to be lured away from his principles, leading to four winless Nations League games, which might suggest conservatism will reign and he will opt for the back three. But this week his assistant Steve Holland spoke of how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/06/england-steve-holland-assistant-coach-mbappe-france-world-cup-quarter-final">deploying a “soldier” to combat Mbappé</a> effectively removed a player from your own side, suggesting a back four.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/09/france-v-england-where-world-cup-quarter-final-could-be-won-and-lost-tactics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The author on identifying with Holden Caulfield and how Margaret Atwood made her a feminist writer</p><p><strong>My earliest reading memory<br /></strong>In order to check out books at the local library you had to be able to sign your name in cursive. I practised obsessively, grateful that my mother had opted for a short name, as writing has always been difficult. I am dyslexic, a fact that gave me an early (and unresolved) case of impostor syndrome. Each time we went to the library, I stocked up. The formative books of my childhood were all set in New York City: EB White’s Stuart Little, the story of a small mouse who lived a seemingly regular life with his adoptive human family, who made him, clothing and his own canoe. Kay Thompson’s Eloise, of the famed Plaza hotel, and Bernard Waber’s Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile, about a toothy character who lived with the Primm family in the house on East 88th Street.</p><p><strong>The book that changed me as a teenager<br /></strong>In the summer of 1972, my parents, who were philosophically and economically opposed to vacations, rented a house in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, for two weeks. The house turned out to have only one bedroom, with five twin beds. Everyone was miserable except me – I swam in the pool that belonged to the hotel next door. It was the summer of Watergate, the summer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jul/03/feminist-magazine-ms-turns-50-a-beacon-for-rights-sex-equality-and-roe-v-wade">Ms Magazine</a> launched, and I was 11 years old, reading the most amazing and horrifying books. The Terminal Man, Michael Crichton’s novel about mind control, was top of my list – a line describing the coarseness of a single male pubic hair still haunts me. Also that summer, I read Will There Really Be a Morning, the autobiography of Frances Farmer. The book is the brutal story of Farmer, an actor, who was committed to a psychiatric hospital. The fear of incarceration, of mental illness, of not being seen for who one is, of being so disappointing or frightening to one’s own family that they send you away, was terrifying. For me, something changed that summer: I went in as one person and came out as another.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/09/am-homes-richard-powers-is-the-american-novelist-for-the-21st-century">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Over the last few years, Gareth Southgate has been perfecting the style that secured the World Cup for Didier Deschamps</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/ericdevin_?lang=en">Eric Devin</a> for <a href="http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/">Get French Football News</a></p><p>“It felt like an Atlético Madrid match. It made me feel at home,” said Antoine Griezmann after France’s semi-final triumph over Belgium at the 2018 World Cup. That 1-0 win against perhaps the most potent attacking team at the tournament – who were fresh from their thrilling quarter-final win over Brazil – summed up France under Didier Deschamps. The team that would go on to become world champions resembled an international version of Diego Simeone’s famously combative Atlético team: conservative and rigid but also boasting supreme quality in forward areas. It is a blueprint that Gareth Southgate has used to achieve England’s recent success.</p><p>Deschamps’ conservative team was designed to fit modern international football, knowing the attacking fluidity achieved by club managers is difficult to replicate in a national team given the minimal time coaches have to work with their players. Many recent successes in international football have been built on a considered style of play: stoic and well organised in defence, with moments of individual quality in attack. Portugal’s triumph at Euro 2016 and France’s win in 2018 are standout examples.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/09/england-tactics-france-world-champions-2018-world-cup-didier-deschamps-gareth-southgate">Continue reading...</a>

## Sam Ryder: There’s Nothing But Space, Man! review – unfortunately apt title for vapid debut album

<p><strong>(Parlophone)<br /></strong>Never mind his trademark vocal prowess: the TikTok and Eurovision star shines most strongly when he shows his vulnerability on the softer songs of this disappointing debut</p><p>Sam Ryder’s brief career has run on surprises: first, posting covers on TikTok, where this sweet, bearded hippie showcased a falsetto so astonishing it grabbed the attention of Alicia Keys. Then, at Eurovision this May, where he shocked a defeated nation by almost winning and, moreover, doing so with a brilliant song, Space Man. A cosmic ballad with touches of Elton and Bowie (and Harry Styles’s similarly inspired Sign of the Times) that made great use of Ryder’s vocal power, its clever, moving lyrics likened the isolation of heartbreak to being stuck in orbit. To boot, this effusively joyful former wedding singer was apparently entirely untouched by cynicism.</p><p>It’s a crushing inevitability, then, that Ryder’s debut album conveys all the limited imagination of the British pop industry trying to capitalise on a viral moment. Although Space Man’s co-writers contributed to several other tracks, that song’s elegance is nowhere to be found among a litany of cliches and self-help guff so toothless it makes Ed Sheeran look like Nick Cave. Even basic sense can be hard to come by: Tiny Riot, with its budget <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/may/09/rag-n-bone-man-life-by-misadventure-review-rory-graham">Rag’n’Bone Man</a> boom, advises us to “turn the pouring rain to the wave of a tiny riot” and suggests that “if butterflies can use their wings to turn the wind to hurricanes / You and I can break the chains”. More baffling still is the entirely out-of-character This Time, a bitter, jaunty up-yours to some big shot who “lost your trust fund and that trophy wife”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/09/sam-ryder-theres-nothing-but-space-man-review-parlophone-eurovision-tiktok">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Blurred lines between one government and the next happen quite often, but that doesn’t mean Starmer’s fight is over</p><p>The British political system likes to present itself as one where power shifts decisively from one party to another. The removal van arrives in Downing Street, and a very different government replaces the defeated one. These quick, dramatic switches are meant to be one of the good points of our system: the electorate’s wishes clearly enacted, in compensation for being kept at a distance from centralised Westminster the rest of the time.</p><p>It’s in the interests of the two big parties sustained by this system to say they offer a stark choice. And sometimes that’s true: Jeremy Corbyn’s loose socialism against Theresa May’s stern Conservatism; Keir Starmer’s self-conscious competence against Boris Johnson’s showy chaos. Since 2015 the gap between Labour and the Tories – in style, ideology and policies – has often been larger than ever.</p><p>Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2022/dec/09/fading-tories-stealing-ideas-labour-keir-starmer">Continue reading...</a>

But who’s reading them, where’s the quality control – and the diversity?</p><p>If it feels as though you can’t move for new music, then books about pop aren’t far behind.

Plus, “the calibre of music publishing has never been stronger than over the past 10 years – the bar is really high, which acts as its own self-fulfilling virtuous circle”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/09/music-books-memoirs-scene-histories-reading-diversity-rock">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Argentinian author explores domestic suspense and psychological imbalance in a disturbing and compelling collection</p><p>Samanta Schweblin is one of a generation of South American female writers whose willingness to experiment with language, content and form has made them some of the most interesting and necessarily provocative voices in literature today (other names include <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/12/paradais-by-fernanda-melchor-review-snakes-mexican-eden-hurricane-season" title="">Fernanda Melchor</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/01/portrait-of-an-unknown-lady-by-maria-gainza-review-bolano-esque-art-mystery" title="">Maria Gainza</a>, Ariana Harwicz and Pola Oloixarac). While their predominantly male forebears staked out the territory of magic realism, these newer writers have arguably shown themselves to be even more innovative, utilising elements of autofiction, reportage and literary postmodernism in their quest to create a literature that offers a uniquely critical perspective on our times.</p><p>With her predilection for the dark and discomfiting, Schweblin sits closest to fellow Argentinian Mariana Enríquez, whose stories also occupy a queasy interstitial realm in which reality and nightmare can be difficult to distinguish. Schweblin’s first work to be translated into English was the 2014 novella <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/24/fever-dream-by-samanta-schweblin-review" title="">Fever Dream</a>, which made the shortlist for the 2017 Booker International. Fever Dream uses the tools of psychological horror to tell a story about the destructive power of agricultural chemical companies, and the economic and political vested interests that afford them protection. She followed this with the 2018 science fiction novel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/25/little-eyes-by-samanta-schweblin-review-timely-visions-of-a-virtual-reality" title="">Little Eyes</a>, which employed a fractured narrative technique to create a highly engaging and thought-provoking commentary on the surveillance state and our willing participation in our own subjugation. In this new collection, winner in the US of a National book award, Schweblin steps back out on the shifting sands of literary horror that characterised Fever Dream, with seven stories of domestic suspense and psychological imbalance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/09/seven-empty-houses-by-samanta-schweblin-review-addictive-short-stories">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Poetry is fulfilling a very human need – to make sense of the senseless and tell their stories</p><p>“There is so much poetry coming out of Ukraine now that I’m barely keeping up with it,” the Ukrainian translator and scholar Oksana Maksymchuk tells me. It is hardly the first thing that one would expect of a country at war. But poetry’s ability to, as she says, “crystallise a particular moment in time, or an emotion that is fleeting”, has led to an outpouring of poems – not so much emotion recollected in tranquillity, as the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings. Often these poems are posted by their authors on social media; the literary journal <a href="https://chytomo.com/stan-z-kryvavoi-krapli-koralom-11-novykh-virshiv-vijny/?fbclid=IwAR2DFAXQsOXFbyLrV4_4W0hH4ca2LiiPLM5PsujNTAWq6qYWngI3wUqWD44">Chytomo</a> has been gathering up and publishing examples, some by established poets, many by those new to the form, including soldiers. There is even a <a href="https://warpoetry.mkip.gov.ua/">Ukrainian government website</a> that encourages members of the public to upload their work. “Every poem, every line, every word is part of Ukrainian history,” the site says. “We know for sure that wars end, but poetry does not.” At the time of writing, more than 24,000 poems had been added to the site.</p><p>“It is true that when Russia’s full-scale invasion started on 24 February, literature was the last thing on people’s minds – “you could not protect your family from a rifle with your poems”, as the writer Oleksandr Mykhed put it. But as the conflict has continued, the power of writing to record, to testify and to witness has seemed more and more important. Many Ukrainians started to keep diaries, the “first responder”, perhaps, among literary genres, able to gather experience and emotion in its rawest form. But in surprising numbers, Ukrainians are also turning to poetry, while setting aside for the time being that time-greedy literary form, the novel. “It’s the condensation, the density of it, the way that you can arrange words so that they carry a lot,” explains Max Rosochinsky who, with Maksymchuk, is co-editor of an anthology of Ukrainian poems, <a href="https://www.wordsforwar.com/">Words for War</a>, born from the conflict that began in 2014 with Russian annexations in the Donbas and Crimea.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/09/for-ukrainians-poetry-isnt-a-luxury-its-a-necessity-during-war">Continue reading...</a>

It’s been touted by celebrities such as Chance the Rapper, Tommy Dorfman, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Britney Spears’ husband, Sam Asghari. But for many women the app does more than just spit out a pretty picture: the final results are highly sexualized, padding women’s breasts and turning their bodies into hourglass physiques.</p><p>“Is it just me or are these AI selfie generator apps perpetuating misogyny?” tweeted Brandee Barker, a feminist and advocate who has worked in the tech industry. “Here are a few I got just based off of photos of my face.” One of Barker’s results showed her wearing supermodel-length hair extensions and a low-cut catsuit.

<p>The actor and director are joined by screenwriter Samuel D Hunter to discuss career comebacks, the hazards of Hollywood and the importance of human connection</p><p>The last time I met Brendan Fraser, he was bouncing off the walls of a Los Angeles hotel suite and looking every bit as popeyed, elastic-limbed and cartoonish as his animated co-stars in Looney Tunes: Back in Action. This was 2008. He was promoting the third Mummy film, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, and not merely answering questions but turning the replies into zany skits or wackadoodle monologues. A jangling desperation, though, lurked just below the surface. It was never more apparent than when he recounted what he had said to a businessman who buttonholed him about the prospect of another Mummy sequel: “I don’t know! Leave me alone!”</p><p>Now we know why. Injuries sustained on that third Mummy picture led to seven years of hospital visits; there were operations on his back, a partial knee replacement and surgery on his vocal cords. In 2009, he and the mother of his three sons divorced. Then, in a 2018 interview headlined “<a href="https://www.gq.com/story/what-ever-happened-to-brendan-fraser">Whatever happened to Brendan Fraser</a>?”, he alleged that he had been groped in 2003 by Philip Berk, a former president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which is responsible for the Golden Globes.

<p>Every scene in this series has a finesse of quality or invention. Full of lovely comedy and espionage antics, it gives stars like Kristin Scott Thomas plenty to relish</p><p>Spies never stop being spies, even when they’ve been out of the game for a while, and even when they know the game is up. Season two of Slow Horses (AppleTV+) starts with an old geezer standing behind the counter of a Soho sex shop, minding his own business – until he recognises a passerby and immediately sets off in pursuit, tailing the mystery man to a railway station, on to a train, then through the rain to catch a rail replacement bus bound for Oxford Parkway. On the bus, the sex shop proprietor begins to feel unwell, but before he drops dead, he types a single codeword into his phone and hides the device down the side of his seat. The man he was following gets away.</p><p>Much of what makes Slow Horses a tasty mis-shape of a drama can be found in that sequence, from the way it’s in bustling London one minute and an unglamorous provincial car park the next, to the fact that a bristly shambles of a man is the protagonist in an exciting chase. Star casting, too: the sex-shop guy, who is clearly a retired intelligence agent, has no lines and carks it before the opening credits, and yet he’s played by the great Phil Davis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/09/slow-horses-season-2-review-apple-tv-gary-oldman-kristin-scott-thomas">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Senior lawyer assisting coroner will not cross-examine police witnesses after bereaved families objected to her law firm’s work with the police</p><p>The coroner leading an inquiry into the 2019 terrorist attack on two Christchurch mosques has ruled a senior lawyer assisting her investigation will not cross-examine police witnesses or give advice on officers’ conduct, after bereaved families called for her removal over her law firm’s close work with the police.</p><p>But coroner Brigitte Windley said in a ruling published on Friday that there was no allegation of misconduct by the lawyer, Alysha McClintock, who is also a Crown prosecutor.

<p>I know what it is like to live in a country where there is no way to voice opposition</p><p>The case of climate protester Violet Coco, who was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/02/climate-activist-who-blocked-traffic-on-sydney-harbour-bridge-jailed-for-at-least-eight-months">sentenced to 15 months in prison</a> for briefly blocking a lane of traffic on the Sydney Harbour Bridge, is a frightening development. This was a peaceful protest, but the court refusing her bail until March is a condition usually imposed on violent criminals, according to her lawyer. A researcher from Human Rights Watch has called the sentence <a href="https://twitter.com/Sophiemcneill/status/1598513805855961088">“outrageous”</a>.</p><p>The escalation of this case to such a completely disproportionate punishment is a part of a trend of shrinking civic space that is being mirrored in other democratic societies. In the UK, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/01/peers-called-on-to-kill-public-order-bill-targeting-climate-activists">new legislation</a> is set to give the police unprecedented powers to shut down protests and punish protesters. New laws in New South Wales that Violet was convicted under were supported by both the Liberal government and Labor opposition, both of which take donations from the fossil fuel companies. These new laws mean that peaceful climate activists face far higher jail terms than serious criminals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/09/as-a-climate-activist-who-has-been-jailed-in-russia-im-concerned-about-australias-treatment-of-violet-coco">Continue reading...</a>
