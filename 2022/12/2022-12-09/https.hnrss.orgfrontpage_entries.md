<p>Hello all,<p>Very excited to share this project with you all!<p>Panoptisch scans your Python file or module to find it's imports (aka dependencies) and recursively does so for all dependencies and sub-dependencies. It then generates a dependency tree in JSON for you to parse and enforce import policies.<p>Supply chain attacks are no joke, and this is one way to transparently analyze your dependencies to see if any malicious imports are taking place. For example, your yaml parser, nor it's sub-dependencies should import socket, or sys.<p>Panoptisch is in early stages, with known limitations (for now). I welcome feedback, testing and contributions.<p>Also, happy to answer any questions!</p>

<p>Hello, we just launched the alpha release of Pynecone - a way to build full-stack web apps in pure Python. The framework is easy to get started with even without previous web dev experience and is completely open source / free to use.<p>We made Pynecone for Python devs who want to make web apps, but don’t want the overhead of having to learn or use Javascript. We wanted more flexibility than existing Python frameworks like Streamlit/Dash that don't allow the user to make real, customizable web apps.<p>With Pynecone, you can make anything from a small data science/python project to a full-scale, multi page web app.  We have over 60+ built-in components and are adding more.<p>We are actively trying to grow this project so no matter you skill level we welcome contributions! Open up an issue if you find missing features/bugs or contribute to existing issue.</p>

<p>I often have a thought or insight and I want to have a conversation about it with interested people. Usually the quality of discussion is best on HN. Sometimes you get a good response to an Ask HN, sometimes it doesn't feel like the right place to post it.<p>I always struggle to find the best place to generate the best discussion. It's like its spread across Reddit, Discord, Slack, HackerNews, Twitter, etc.<p>Anyone else struggle with this?</p>

<p>Considering how easy it is to generate a public/private key pair it's not that easy and not cheap to get an widely trusted document signing certificate. Especially one with LTV (longtime valid for verifying)<p>Is this just the market monopoly? If letsencrypt broke it for SSL, couldn't it be done for PDF signing also?</p>

## KaiPod Learning (YC S21) Is Hiring a Founding Engineer

<p>Hi everyone - we're hiring our first engineer for KaiPod Learning to power our new learning model.<p>A bit about us -
* Coming out of the pandemic, more parents than ever want to be in charge of their child's education. In fact, more than 5M will want their child to pursue alternatives (e.g., online schools, homeschooling) in the next 5 years.
* But if we don't solve for socialization, childcare, and academic support, most parents will give up and go back to the status quo.
* To solve this problem, we're building a network of in-person learning centers where students can come to do work, make friends, and get academic support.
* We launched on HN last year - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28346873" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28346873</a><p>In the last year:
* We have expanded from an idea to now supporting 200+ kids across 5 states. We're on track to get to 1,000 kids by the fall.
* We need to accelerate the build of our tech product so we can support students, parents, and educators.<p>We are hiring for a Founding Engineer.
* This job is for someone who likes wearing multiple hats and craves the chance to shape our product and tech stack. 
* This job is for someone who loves education but thinks there is a lot of room for improvement.
* This is a founding team role, so we also want to meet people who like the chance to shape company culture.<p>Just today, we got word that a student who started with us in August (and was reading at a 4th grade level) tested at the 7th grade reading level. That is 3 YEARS of progress in 3 MONTHS. We are quite literally changing lives and can't wait to reach millions of kids!<p>For more info on the job and to apply, please head to:

<p>Fellow members,<p>I'm curious to know what are some of the best prompts to use on ChatGPT to understand its full-fledged capability as a newbie developer.<p>One of the things I noticed, is that it produces the requested code in the cleanest manner but it's not complete. For instance, I tried the prompt - "give me the python code for TicTacToe Game" and the code produced was incomplete.<p>Have you all encountered the same or my prompt is inappropriate?</p>

## Ask HN: Developer abused “sign in with GitHub” and users are being punished

<p>The offending website "nopecha.com", which unfortunately i found about a week ago on HN itself appeared to be another captcha service but one that was offering "1 Sec" solve speed for text captchas. i was interested and by the looks of it, a lot of people. 
their webisite only had "sign in with google" so i didnt bother. The day before i check the website out of boredom and saw "sign in with github". i logged in, clicked through a bunch of pages because its the same drill everytime. 
i found out that i had "automatically starred their repos". by the looks of it, around 500 "stars", the last i saw.<p>suddenly i am unable to log in to my github and the page just says "account suspended."<p>contacted their support and the last response i got from them was "your ban should stay as you engaged in improper behavior of stars farming" or some other BS.<p>Here is my problem. I am not a part of nopecha. I just used their website once using "sign in with github" button. That is the extent of my involvement.<p>How can github allow the developer to use "sign in with" button to create a situation that they could LATER consider abusive but then go ahead and ban all the victims also?<p>i did not voluntarily want to join their abusive practice, i just wanted a log into the website. (There was no explicit mention of the stars farming practice on the website) Why is github allowing the developer to abuse their Oath in the first place?<p>If this is going to be a norm going forward, i do not see any hope of "sign in with" buttons for any service because then you could be banned from one service and suddenly everything connected to your account is also banned.<p>I honestly expect the "sign in with x" button to provide a frictionless access to a website, thats it. how could the developer abuse that process and the website, instead of acting on the developer alone, are causing trouble to unsuspecting victims?</p>

## Ask HN: My iOS app got stuck in review for a month. What should I do?

<p>Basically the title. Last month, I submitted an app to the App Store for review, and it's been stuck in review for over a month now. Any attempt to contact apple is met with "just wait" response. It's starting to feel like my app is stuck in limbo<p>I've searched the internet, and it seems like many people are experiencing the same problem. Any advice on how to get my app approved and out of review?<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

## What Is Going on with Neo4j?

<p>Neo4j Inc just laid off 10% of its employees.<p>The negative reviews in GlassDoor are piling up, and seem to share common themes - and it is not pretty.<p>There are accusations that management tried to lie to early investors about revenue sources.<p>Does anyone have any idea or insight into what is going on with them?</p>
