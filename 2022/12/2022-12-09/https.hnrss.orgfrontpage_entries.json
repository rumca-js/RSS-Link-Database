It then generates a dependency tree in JSON for you to parse and enforce import policies.<p>Supply chain attacks are no joke, and this is one way to transparently analyze your dependencies to see if any malicious imports are taking place. For example, your yaml parser, nor it's sub-dependencies should import socket, or sys.<p>Panoptisch is in early stages, with known limitations (for now). I welcome feedback, testing and contributions.<p>Also, happy to answer any questions!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33926782\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33926782</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/a-100mw-solar-farm-in-texas-will-mount-panels-directly-on-the-ground", "title": "A 100MW solar farm in Texas will mount panels directly on the ground", "date_published": "2022-12-09 21:33:46+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/a-100mw-solar-farm-in-texas-will-mount-panels-directly-on-the-ground\">https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/a-100mw-solar-farm-in-texas-will-mount-panels-directly-on-the-ground</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33926683\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33926683</a></p>\n<p>Points: 17</p>\n<p># Comments: 14</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://swr.vercel.app/blog/swr-v2", "title": "SWR 2.0", "date_published": "2022-12-09 21:29:57+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://swr.vercel.app/blog/swr-v2\">https://swr.vercel.app/blog/swr-v2</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33926652\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33926652</a></p>\n<p>Points: 15</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://blog.datawrapper.de/the-case-for-speed-limits/", "title": "Debunking common myths about the German Autobahn", "date_published": "2022-12-09 21:27:20+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/the-case-for-speed-limits/\">https://blog.datawrapper.de/the-case-for-speed-limits/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33926630\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33926630</a></p>\n<p>Points: 26</p>\n<p># Comments: 32</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html", "title": "Uxn is a virtual machine with 32 instructions", "date_published": "2022-12-09 21:23:39+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html\">https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33926600\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33926600</a></p>\n<p>Points: 29</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://twitter.com/torynski/status/1600968583055826944", "title": "The Tesla Semi cab from the practical POV of someone who drives trucks", "date_published": "2022-12-09 21:19:32+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/torynski/status/1600968583055826944\">https://twitter.com/torynski/status/1600968583055826944</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33926564\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33926564</a></p>\n<p>Points: 171</p>\n<p># Comments: 76</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/besanta-by-animato/id1658475271", "title": "Show HN: BeSanta, Real time Santa Claus AI avatars on your iPhone Ho-ho-ho", "date_published": "2022-12-09 21:10:09+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/besanta-by-animato/id1658475271\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/besanta-by-animato/id1658475271</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33926489\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33926489</a></p>\n<p>Points: 15</p>\n<p># Comments: 11</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2022/12/09/faster-horse/", "title": "A Faster Horse: Infrastructure was the cloud\u2019s first act.

The framework is easy to get started with even without previous web dev experience and is completely open source / free to use.<p>We made Pynecone for Python devs who want to make web apps, but don\u2019t want the overhead of having to learn or use Javascript. We wanted more flexibility than existing Python frameworks like Streamlit/Dash that don't allow the user to make real, customizable web apps.<p>With Pynecone, you can make anything from a small data science/python project to a full-scale, multi page web app.  We have over 60+ built-in components and are adding more.<p>We are actively trying to grow this project so no matter you skill level we welcome contributions!

In fact, more than 5M will want their child to pursue alternatives (e.g., online schools, homeschooling) in the next 5 years.\n* But if we don't solve for socialization, childcare, and academic support, most parents will give up and go back to the status quo.\n* To solve this problem, we're building a network of in-person learning centers where students can come to do work, make friends, and get academic support.\n* We launched on HN last year - <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28346873\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28346873</a><p>In the last year:\n* We have expanded from an idea to now supporting 200+ kids across 5 states. We're on track to get to 1,000 kids by the fall.\n* We need to accelerate the build of our tech product so we can support students, parents, and educators.<p>We are hiring for a Founding Engineer.\n* This job is for someone who likes wearing multiple hats and craves the chance to shape our product and tech stack. \n* This job is for someone who loves education but thinks there is a lot of room for improvement.\n* This is a founding team role, so we also want to meet people who like the chance to shape company culture.<p>Just today, we got word that a student who started with us in August (and was reading at a 4th grade level) tested at the 7th grade reading level. That is 3 YEARS of progress in 3 MONTHS. We are quite literally changing lives and can't wait to reach millions of kids!<p>For more info on the job and to apply, please head to:\n<a href=\"https://www.kaipodlearning.com/founding-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kaipodlearning.com/founding-engineer</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33920330\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33920330</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.iranintl.com/en/202212077198", "title": "Iranian Officials Asking Venezuela for Asylum in Case of Regime Change", "date_published": "2022-12-09 11:36:32+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.iranintl.com/en/202212077198\">https://www.iranintl.com/en/202212077198</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33920210\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33920210</a></p>\n<p>Points: 47</p>\n<p># Comments: 44</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzZC6aFsk3M", "title": "Is America Stealing TSMC?", "date_published": "2022-12-09 11:27:40+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzZC6aFsk3M\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzZC6aFsk3M</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33920166\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33920166</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/releases/0.3.62", "title": "PipeWire 0.3.62", "date_published": "2022-12-09 11:14:11+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/releases/0.3.62\">https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/releases/0.3.62</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33920086\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33920086</a></p>\n<p>Points: 28</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://github.com/getlago/lago/wiki/Stripe%27s-real-pricing:-a-primer", "title": "Stripe\u2019s Pricing Breakdown", "date_published": "2022-12-09 11:01:49+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/getlago/lago/wiki/Stripe%27s-real-pricing:-a-primer\">https://github.com/getlago/lago/wiki/Stripe%27s-real-pricing:-a-primer</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33920019\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33920019</a></p>\n<p>Points: 23</p>\n<p># Comments: 8</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://nuitka.net/posts/all-in-with-nuitka.html", "title": "All in with Nuitka", "date_published": "2022-12-09 10:36:03+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://nuitka.net/posts/all-in-with-nuitka.html\">https://nuitka.net/posts/all-in-with-nuitka.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33919830\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33919830</a></p>\n<p>Points: 54</p>\n<p># Comments: 8</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://scholar.archive.org/", "title": "Internet Archive Scholar", "date_published": "2022-12-09 10:35:25+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://scholar.archive.org/\">https://scholar.archive.org/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33919823\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33919823</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33919535", "title": "Ask HN: What are your technology trends predictions for 2023?", "date_published": "2022-12-09 09:53:24+00:00", "description": "<p>Apart from ChatGPT of course.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33919535\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33919535</a></p>\n<p>Points: 25</p>\n<p># Comments: 34</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33919451", "title": "Ask HN: Can ChatGPT generate fully functional code?", "date_published": "2022-12-09 09:38:20+00:00", "description": "<p>Fellow members,<p>I'm curious to know what are some of the best prompts to use on ChatGPT to understand its full-fledged capability as a newbie developer.<p>One of the things I noticed, is that it produces the requested code in the cleanest manner but it's not complete.

The day before i check the website out of boredom and saw \"sign in with github\". i logged in, clicked through a bunch of pages because its the same drill everytime. \ni found out that i had \"automatically starred their repos\". by the looks of it, around 500 \"stars\", the last i saw.<p>suddenly i am unable to log in to my github and the page just says \"account suspended.\"<p>contacted their support and the last response i got from them was \"your ban should stay as you engaged in improper behavior of stars farming\" or some other BS.<p>Here is my problem. I am not a part of nopecha. I just used their website once using \"sign in with github\" button. That is the extent of my involvement.<p>How can github allow the developer to use \"sign in with\" button to create a situation that they could LATER consider abusive but then go ahead and ban all the victims also?<p>i did not voluntarily want to join their abusive practice, i just wanted a log into the website.

Any advice on how to get my app approved and out of review?<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33917091\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33917091</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://blog.chromium.org/2022/12/introducing-passkeys-in-chrome.html", "title": "Introducing passkeys in Chrome", "date_published": "2022-12-09 03:28:25+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2022/12/introducing-passkeys-in-chrome.html\">https://blog.chromium.org/2022/12/introducing-passkeys-in-chrome.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33917070\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33917070</a></p>\n<p>Points: 52</p>\n<p># Comments: 38</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33916240", "title": "What Is Going on with Neo4j?", "date_published": "2022-12-09 01:31:26+00:00", "description": "<p>Neo4j Inc just laid off 10% of its employees.<p>The negative reviews in GlassDoor are piling up, and seem to share common themes - and it is not pretty.<p>There are accusations that management tried to lie to early investors about revenue sources.<p>Does anyone have any idea or insight into what is going on with them?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33916240\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33916240</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 6</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.noemamag.com/concrete-built-the-modern-world-now-its-destroying-it/", "title": "Concrete Built the Modern World.
