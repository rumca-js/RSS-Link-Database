Justin Murphy invited me to California for a weekend to do that interview that we've been meaning to do since 4 years ago! We talk about why I left academia, epistemological anarchism, Orthodoxy Christianity, the Enlightenment and lots of questions about lifestyles for people who are contemplating being future ex-"bugmen" and ex-academics.
