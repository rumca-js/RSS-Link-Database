<p>The Google Chrome browser now supports something new to secure your life: passkeys, a stronger, leak-proof version of a password that can use your phone as a token to authorize you to websites.</p>



<p>Passkeys can and will be stored inside the Google Password Manager, or inside apps that support passkeys within future versions of Android, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.chromium.org/2022/12/introducing-passkeys-in-chrome.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1431681-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Google said</a>. Passkeys are enabled in the lastest version of Chrome in both Windows 11, macOS, and Android.</p>



<p>Passkeys are surprisingly easy to understand. You&rsquo;re familiar with a username and password. The latter should be a complex series of letters and numbers &mdash; the longer the password<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393960/how-to-pick-the-perfect-password.html"> the more secure it is, in general</a>. But once they&rsquo;re exposed in a breach, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394029/how-to-create-strong-secure-passwords.html">they can be surprisingly easy to crack</a>. It&rsquo;s why a password manager, even a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394076/best-free-password-managers.html">free password manager</a>, is the ideal solution &mdash; a password manager can generate pseudo-random passwords <em>and </em>store them securely.</p>



<p>But a passkey isn&rsquo;t a password at all. It&rsquo;s simply a token that&rsquo;s stored on your phone. When asked to authenticate you, the token on your phone communicates with the site or app in question. No password is ever used, so no password is ever exchanged or stored. </p>



<p>&ldquo;A passkey doesn&rsquo;t leave your mobile device when signing in like this,&rdquo; Google said. &ldquo;Only a securely generated code is exchanged with the site so, unlike a password, there&rsquo;s nothing that could be leaked.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s part of an <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://fidoalliance.org/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard-to-accelerate-availability-of-passwordless-sign-ins/&amp;xcust=2-1-1431681-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">agreement</a> Apple, Google, and Microsoft made in May. </p>



<p>In the real world, then, here&rsquo;s an example of what you might see:</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google Chrome passkey" class="wp-image-1431692" height="1199" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Passkey-1.gif?w=568" width="568" /><figcaption>Passkeys will be stored in password managers, but they don&rsquo;t actually use passwords to authenticate you.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Google</p></div>



<p>In the example (a fictional bank illustrated by Google), you have the choice of entering a stored password, or using a passkey instead. The user is asked to authenticate the password by simply using their screen lock, presumably a fingerprint reader. One difference here is that some mobile banking apps already allow you to do this. Here, the user is accessing the website itself and is using the same biometric login.</p>



<p>Naturally, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t use your bank&rsquo;s website when you could use the (presumably safer) app. But this new capability in Chrome will allow you to replace passwords with passkeys on theoretically any website, provided the site supports them.</p>



<p>On a desktop PC, the process would work in a similar manner. A passkey could presumably replace any site&rsquo;s password. Here, you would have three options: log in with Windows Hello via your face or fingerprint; log in with your nearby smartphone, much as you would on mobile; or use a USB security key. All three are viable options.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Google Chrome passkey PC" class="wp-image-1431693" height="450" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Passkey-PC.gif" width="800" /><figcaption>A user uses their smartphone to authenticate with a passkey while accessing a site on their PC, in this example.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Google</p></div>



<p>Replacing passwords with passkeys won&rsquo;t happen overnight. But as more sites sign on to using them, passkeys will become more important &mdash; and so will your phone, as a digital &ldquo;wallet&rdquo; for storing them.</p>

## Hades II will resurrect one of the best roguelikes ever

<p>Developer Supergiant Games is known as one of the best indie developers out there, packing incredible art, polish, and storytelling into games like <em>Bastion </em>and <em>Transistor</em>. Even so, gamers everywhere were blown away by <em>Hades</em>, the studio&rsquo;s combat-heavy roguelike from 2020. Well offer up sacrifices to the cthonic gods, because <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/&amp;xcust=2-3-1431277-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Hades II</em> was announced</a> at last night&rsquo;s game awards. Not only is it a welcome news for players of the original, it&rsquo;s a bit of a surprise: Supergiant has never made a direct sequel before. </p>



<p>If you haven&rsquo;t played the original, <em>Hades </em>is a top-down combat game of randomized arenas and setpiece boss battles. But that&rsquo;s selling the game short. You play Zagreus, son of Hades, as he battles his way out of the levels of the mythical Greek underworld to find his mother Persephone. (Their relationship status is officially Complicated, if you remember your mythical history.) On the way, he powers up with boons from the Olympian gods, underworld pomegranates, hammers from Daedalus, and the occasional helping hand from mythical VIPs like Sisyphus, Eurydice, and Patroclus. When you die &mdash; and you die <em>a lot</em>, it&rsquo;s the underworld after all &mdash; you go back to your dad&rsquo;s house to unlock more permanent power-ups and try, try again. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Hades II gameplay gif" class="wp-image-1431422" height="338" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/221130_IRIS_REVEAL_TRAILER_V14_forGIF_C.gif" width="600" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Supergiant Games</p></div>



<p><em>Hades</em>&lsquo; buttery-smooth combat is a definite highlight. It takes notes from roguelikes like <em>Dead Cells</em>, with its randomized battle rooms and weapons and strategies that can shift radically based on which power-ups you find on your run. It helps that the animation and art for the game is gorgeous (and full to bursting with impossibly attractive gods and humans). But the really engaging part of the game is its story, unlocked with hundreds of interactions with the gods, members of the house of Hades, and the famous residents of the underworld. Incredible voice acting from a huge cast fleshes out the myth of Hades and Persephone in a shockingly human, down-to-earth way. </p>

<p>Hades II will give players control of Melino&euml; who, like her brother Zagreus, is a real character from Greek myth. She doesn&rsquo;t have much in the way of actual story about her, though. Presumably that will give Supergiant some breathing room in fleshing out the game&rsquo;s narrative, which has you killing Cronos, the Titanic father of Zeus and the other first-generation Olympians like Hera, Hades, and Poseidon. (Whom he once ate like a bunch of godly Cheetos. Greek myth is, again, Complicated.) The one-two punch of speedy combat and character interactions looks unchanged, though we do see glimpses of newcomers Apollo and Nemesis. </p>



<p><em>Hades II</em> has no official launch date at the moment, but like the original game, it will be available in Early Access at some point. Speaking of which, <em>Hades </em>is available on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/&amp;xcust=2-3-1431277-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">every major platform and console</a>, including MacOS and Switch, and it should play just fine <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/557177/the-best-pc-games-of-2021-that-dont-need-a-graphics-card.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">even without a discrete graphics card</a>. So you don&rsquo;t have an excuse for missing one of the best games to come out in the last few years. </p>

<p>Both Intel and AMD launched heavy hitters this year, with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357979/intel-core-i9-13900k-review.html">13th-generation Raptor Lake</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1074246/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-review.html">Ryzen 7000</a> blowing past their predecessors on benchmark charts. With how much raw power they offer, you&rsquo;d think that the top dog Core i9-13900K would have been a shoo-in for this pick. Gordon, our resident CPU reviewer, certainly did.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for Gordon, democracy prevailed. The rest of the crew much preferred the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/701130/tested-the-ryzen-7-5800x3ds-astonishing-performance-shows-how-far-amds-ryzen-has-come.html">Ryzen 7 5800X3D</a>, AMD&rsquo;s superb bookend to the AM4 era. Given the 5800X3D&rsquo;s current street prices, the majority felt this chip offers <em>excellent</em> performance in the areas most people care about&mdash;gaming and streaming&mdash;while also showcasing <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394653/amd-v-cache-for-ryzen-everything-you-need-to-know.html">AMD&rsquo;s impressive new V-Cache tech</a>. It also didn&rsquo;t hurt that this ultra-powerful CPU can slip into your existing motherboard as a fairly easy and low-cost upgrade.</p>



<p>One big thing that came out of this discussion: Each person defining what makes a product a <em>favorite</em> of the year, rather than the best (a shift in theme for these 2022 Nerdies). This becomes very relevant in the next topic, GPUs.</p>

<p>Poor Brad. On the one hand, 2022 saw the launch of new graphics cards, saving him from yet another year of enduring a win for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/403056/best-pc-hardware-2018-full-nerd-episode-79.html">integrated graphics</a> as our GPU pick. However, on the other hand, he had to spend a lot of effort for the majority to agree on the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090</a> as the favorite.</p>



<p>Despite clear evidence of the 4090&rsquo;s futuristically fast performance, Adam and Keith countered hard with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341464/intel-arc-a770-a750-graphics-card-xe-hpg-review.html">Intel&rsquo;s new Arc graphics cards</a> as their favorite of the year&mdash;despite the A770 and A750 showing up to the table with issues (like drivers). The pair defended Intel passionately, touting the effort (and the attention paid to the mid-range) as worthy of favorite status. Perhaps not <em>best</em>, but favorite.</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s just say the conversation got downright emotional fast, lasting nearly twice as long as the CPU discussion and reaching an intense fever point before Adam and Keith finally cracked. (At Alaina&rsquo;s instigation.) In the end, the GeForce RTX 4090&rsquo;s face-melting speed and unlocking of all-new gaming experiences&mdash;no-compromises ray tracing and 120Hz+ 4K gaming, along with the introduction of AI-powered DLSS Frame Generation&mdash;earned this brutal graphics card a hard-won crown. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1375901/tested-nvidias-geforce-rtx-4090-is-a-content-creation-monster.html">It&rsquo;s a beast for content creation</a>, too.</p>

<p>Like 2021, a ton of great new cases came available in 2022&mdash;and at all sizes. Whether you wanted something small and modular like the Phanteks Evolv Shift XT, a tidy case that supports optical drives like the Fractal Design Pop Mini Air, or a pretty yet meaty box like the Lian Li Lancool III, everyone got something novel and new.</p>



<p>But none were as fresh as the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*l6kYCuH720&amp;mid=44583&amp;ul=2-3-1430365-1-0-0&amp;murl=https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16811352205?Item=N82E16811352205" rel="nofollow">Fractal Design North</a>, a mid-tower airflow case with typical proportions but an original take on a slatted front panel. Rather than plastic or metal, Fractal used <em>wood</em>, with your choice of stain colors. It&rsquo;ll blend in with most of today&rsquo;s current home decor, too, given how popular mid-century modern is right now. The Fractal Design North also offers excellent airflow, cooling performance, and buildability. That&rsquo;s a word, right? </p>



<p>Our only complaint? There&rsquo;s not a smaller mini-ITX version available. Yet. (Ahem.)</p>

<p>Accessories are defined as items that add value or utility, or enhance the appearance of the primary item. Which means you can count a lot of things that aren&rsquo;t just keyboards, mice, headphones, and the like. For example: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/617378/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-the-steam-deck.html">The Steam Deck</a>. Actually, not just for example, given that we picked it as our favorite PC accessory.</p>



<p>Yes, it is a computer unto itself. But for how it&rsquo;s used in the real world&mdash;as a complement rather than replacement for a gaming rig&mdash;it&rsquo;s more an accessory than an independent device, allowing you to continue your games away from your desk (or your home all together). Adam and Keith couldn&rsquo;t stop speaking enthusiastically about their Steam Decks, and even those of us without one plan to eventually rectify that. Valve actually managed to make a portable gaming handheld a reality, and Linux gaming a reality, all for under $400. Bravo.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">Choosing a laptop</a> (much like a computer case) often boils down to your needs and personal taste. Which makes picking a consensus favorite <em>difficult</em>.</p>



<p>But Asus&rsquo;s improvements to its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/617171/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-2022-review.html">Zephyrus G14</a> (plus a hefty assist from AMD&rsquo;s excellent Ryzen 6900HS and Radeon RX 6800S) helped the company win this category twice with the same model. (Well, technically, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398953/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-the-first-ryzen-4000-laptop.html">2020</a> and 2022 models.) It&rsquo;s fast, powerful, lightweight, and even sports a futuristic mini-LED display on its exterior for showing notifications, battery life info, music visualizations, and more. At $2,500, this version of the ROG Zephyrus G14 isn&rsquo;t cheap, but you get a lot in this 3.8-lb notebook. And it&rsquo;s a fun machine. Seriously, look at that AniME Matrix display on its lid!</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dr Lisa Su holding 3D VCache prototype chip" class="wp-image-1430388" height="662" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/amd-computex-2021-3d-v-cache-up-close-chip-100890601-orig.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>AMD&rsquo;s Dr. Lisa Su holds up the prototype 3D V-Cache chip.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">YouTube / AMD</p></div>



<p>Behind every throne lies the true power, and that adage holds for our favorite CPU, the Ryzen 7 5800X3D. Without its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394653/amd-v-cache-for-ryzen-everything-you-need-to-know.html">revolutionary new 3D V-Cache technology</a>, this top-notch gaming chip wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;<em>couldn&rsquo;t</em>&mdash;exist. First announced mid-2021, AMD&rsquo;s brand-new tech adds L3 cache to a chip by stacking it atop the die itself, creating a silicon sandwich full of delicious high-performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the case of the 5800X3D, the use of 3D-VCache technology tripled the chip&rsquo;s amount of L3 cache compared to its siblings to give it a <em>huge</em> boost to gaming performance. Enough so that the 5800X3D could beat the then-flagship Intel Core i9-12900K&mdash;and both Intel and AMD were hesitant to compare their newest generations of processors against this stacked-cache stunner. At this point, the only question we have about 3D V-Cache is when it&rsquo;ll next appear. We can&rsquo;t wait to see what a Ryzen 7 7800X3D (or whatever chip appears with this kind of extra fat cache) can do.</p>

<p>We mean pricing on new hardware launched in 2022, but really, it&rsquo;s the cost of everything in 2022. MSRPs keep rising.</p>



<p>Unlike 2021, when prices ballooned due to mining, scalping, logistics woes, and general shortages on goods we all wanted, this year we had to stomach higher <em>list</em> prices for new launches. Of course, not all hardware bloated in price and dropped in value, but GPUs like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html">$1,200 RTX 4080</a> and the impending <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1370609/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-5-crucial-details-pc-gamers-need-to-know.html">$899 Radeon RX 7900 XT</a> sure feel overpriced relative to their specs. AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 7000 processors already received heavy criticism for their perceived high cost. Are we entitled to fast hardware at loss-leader prices? No. But it feels like the insanity will never end.</p>

<p>The Roccat Burst Pro Air occupies a comfortable niche in Roccat&rsquo;s line-up, being arguably the most aesthetically pleasing and an excellent performer in games. More precisely it packs four stellar RGB lighting zones as well as a precise 19,000 DPI sensor and dual wireless and wired connectivity.</p>



<p>That said, there are a few downsides: It&rsquo;s both heavier and pricier than rivals like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/792405/hyperx-pulsefire-haste-wireless-gaming-mouse-review.html">HyperX Pulsefire Haste Wireless</a> and the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro. But as I found out, these compromises are worth weighing for a gaming mouse that performs so well and offers as much versatility as the Burst Air Pro does.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>This review is part of our ongoing roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/452384/best-gaming-mice.html">best gaming mice</a>. Go there to learn about competing products, what to look for in a gaming mouse, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>



<h3 id="roccat-burst-pro-air-design-and-build">Roccat Burst Pro Air: Design and build</h3>



<p>Unboxing the Burst Pro Air revealed what looked like a straightforward symmetrical, six-button, FPS-style gaming mouse. However, its &ldquo;special something&rdquo; soon burst into view&mdash;literally&mdash;in the form of its stunning RGB lighting.</p>



<p>Roccat buried a honeycomb grid just below the surface of the mouse&rsquo;s semi-transparent plastic outer layer&mdash;a design that creates a dazzling RGB glow that&rsquo;s mesmerizing from every angle. But once you switch off the RGB, it&rsquo;s all black again&mdash;the Pro Air will fit in just as easily next to your office PC as it will your gaming rig.</p>



<p>The four independent Roccat AIMO RGB lighting zones consist of two at the back and one under each of the main clicks. Consequently, you can light up the whole thing spectacularly or have fun changing up which zones are illuminated and how. There are 16.8 million programmable RGB colors to play with too, as well as some neat visual effects available in the Swarm software app.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1418487" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221130_195220.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>By customizing the Pro Air&rsquo;s RGB in the Swarm app you can get some stunning visual effects.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>While the fashion among gaming mice tends to be flared main buttons, by contrast the Pro Air&rsquo;s two main clicks are tight rectangles. They stretch from the front all the way to its midsection. This makes it very easy to use if you&rsquo;re a claw griper, since you can grip as far back as the center and your clicks will still register. Apart from the main clicks, you also get two left side buttons, a DPI button, and a mouse wheel in front of it&mdash;all of which seem ideally placed.</p>



<p>Palm gripping is super easy to do too since the Pro Air is nicely proportioned to rest against the top of your palm. Its 4.7 x 1.5 x 2.6-inch body fits snugly into your hand&rsquo;s contours, feeling neither too small nor too big. The left-hand side buttons deserve a special mention, too, for being just the right size and shape for your thumb.</p>



<p>Two large, heat-treated PTFE glide skates make any movements across your mouse pad very smooth and effortless, and there are hexagonal grids flanking each side that serve as useful grips to prevent your fingers slipping&mdash;a bonus when your hand gets sweaty.</p>



<p>That said, the Pro Air&rsquo;s design isn&rsquo;t perfect. While it scores marks for size, it loses a few points for its 81-gram weight. Just last year 81 grams would have been considered quite light for an FPS gaming mouse, but releases like the 62-gram Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro and the 63-gram Logitech G Pro X Superlight have set a new benchmark for what constitutes lightweight.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1418447" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Hand.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>RGB lighting zones beneath each of the Pro Air&rsquo;s main buttons illumiate your fingers as you use it.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>In general, this advance has been reflected in prices, with mice that exceed the 70-gram mark being some of the more affordable now. This makes the Pro Air&rsquo;s $79.95 shelf price look a little high. That point really hits home when you compare it to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/792405/hyperx-pulsefire-haste-wireless-gaming-mouse-review.html">HyperX Pulsefire Haste Wireless</a>, an excellent FPS gaming mouse that weighs just 61 grams and costs only $50 USD.</p>



<p>Despite this, most rivals lack at least one of the Pro Air&rsquo;s features: The V3 Pro, for instance, has no RGB lighting, whereas the HyperX Pulsefire Haste Wireless doesn&rsquo;t offer as many connectivity options. So while the Pro Air might not be the cheapest or lightest gaming mouse you can buy, it certainly is an all-rounder that goes the extra mile.</p>

<h3 id="roccat-burst-pro-air-connectivity">Roccat Burst Pro Air: Connectivity</h3>



<p>The Burst Pro Air differentiates itself from its near sibling, the Roccat Burst Pro, by sporting wireless as well as wired connectivity, which means it&rsquo;s a go-anywhere mouse that you can just as easily use plugged into your home gaming rig as you can unplugged on a laptop you take to your friend&rsquo;s house.</p>



<p>Additionally, you get not one, but two wireless options&mdash;Bluetooth 5.2 as well as low-latency 2.4GHz Wi-Fi&mdash;which adds to its versatility as a mouse that you can use for work as well as play. By comparison, the HyperX Pulsefire Haste Wireless offers only a low-latency 2.4GHz Wi-Fi option as well as wired connectivity.</p>



<p>Switching between connectivity modes is simple, requiring just the flick of a switch on the underside. In these unplugged modes, the Pro Air is rated for 100 hours battery life, which is more than enough to get you through a handful of gaming sessions, or even a midweek work trip.</p>



<p>For a wired connection, Roccat provides you with a long 1.8-meter, flexible USB-C to USB-A cable that should service even the hardest to reach PCs. This cable also doubles as a fast-charging cable when you&rsquo;re out of battery, and it comes with a neat plastic protector to keep the USB-A side free of water or dust.</p>



<p>A discrete dongle storage port on the underside of the mouse is also a nifty inclusion that makes losing your USB-A receiver a little harder to do.</p>



<h3 id="roccat-burst-pro-air-software">ROCCAT Burst Pro Air: Software</h3>



<p>The Burst Pro Air makes use of ROCCAT&rsquo;s Swarm app, which is where you&rsquo;ll need to go to assign commands, create the five on-board profiles and customize the RGB lighting colors or effects. ROCCAT have made this fairly easy to do with submenus that you can easily navigate through, and thanks to a recent update the app looks modern and more visually appealing than before.</p>



<p>In Swarm I was delighted to see that you can adjust the Pro Air&rsquo;s debounce time, which is a feature you won&rsquo;t see in all gaming mice. This makes the Pro Air a good option for Sandbox-style games where debounce rates are particularly useful. Or if you&rsquo;re into spreadsheeting, you may even find a use for this feature for rote productivity tasks like filling out columns in half the time.</p>

<h3 id="roccat-burst-pro-air-performance">ROCCAT Burst Pro Air: Performance</h3>



<p>The Pro Air packs a Roccat Owl-Eye optical sensor which tracks movement at 19,000 DPI and at 400 IPS (inches per second). It&rsquo;s based on the PixArt PAW3370 sensor, which for your reference, is considered an excellent option for FPS gamers.</p>



<p>To test it out, I fired up the PC and sunk a decent amount of time into <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em>. No matter what kind of action I faced, the Pro Air kept me competitive. Thankfully, I didn&rsquo;t notice any lag, even while pulling off large sweeping movements or spinning to face foes, and it just as easily handled the short, sharp flicks I needed to pull off to precisely target foes from far away.</p>



<p>The Pro Air&rsquo;s symmetrical shape gave it a very predictable feel and made it super easy to judge how far to move my crosshairs. The mouse wheel was also a pleasure to use, proving wobble free and highly responsive. It gives you three commands&mdash;a forwards and backwards scroll function, and a downwards click, which were ideal for changing weapons or tossing grenades and flashbangs.</p>



<p>I did at times find myself wishing it also had left and right tilt functionality which would have been highly useful in games like <em>Rainbow Six Siege, </em>where peeking around corners is easier to do with a four directional wheel. Still, it was easy enough to assign extra commands to my keyboard, and gamers who need the left and right lateral wheel inputs, or otherwise more commands, can always opt for the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/833406/roccat-kone-xp-gaming-mouse-review.html">Roccat Kone XP</a> instead, a mouse which does both of these things extremely well.</p>



<p>The buttons also deserve solid praise. They felt soft and light to press, and their low-latency optical switches, which are rated for 100 million clicks, actuated my clicks instantly. I also attribute the Pro Air&rsquo;s low latency response, to some degree, to its support for the Nvidia Reflex technology, which may have done a lot to optimize my click-to-display latency also.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1418531" height="742" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Swarm-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Button assignment in the ROCCAT Swarm app.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>My only nit-pick about the Pro Air, if I had to name one, is that it can very rarely overshoot the mark when carrying out super precise maneuvers. This doesn&rsquo;t happen a lot, but the one time in one thousand when it does, can be a little off-putting.</p>



<p>This could have been due to the inertia of its 81-gram weight or the fact that I had become accustomed to the much lighter HyperX Pulsefire Haste Wireless, so I may have been pushing it a little over-enthusiastically to compensate. Regardless, it&rsquo;s worth noting, nonetheless.</p>



<h3 id="should-you-buy-the-roccat-burst-pro-air">Should you buy the Roccat Burst Pro Air?</h3>



<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for the lightest FPS gaming mouse at the cheapest price possible, then the Pro Air won&rsquo;t match the likes of the HyperX Pulsefire Haste Wireless, or some other rival FPS gaming mouse that may beat it on both of those fronts.</p>



<p>On the other hand, for just a bit more pocket change and a few extra grams weight, the Pro Air give you a mouse that has more dazzling RGB, more connectivity options, and performs equally as well in fast-paced games. Plus, it&rsquo;ll pass as an attractive work companion when you want it to, something that many FPS mice simply can&rsquo;t do&mdash;yet another reason this mouse should win tons of fans.</p>
