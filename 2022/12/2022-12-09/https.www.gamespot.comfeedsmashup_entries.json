From Software's latest title has been a chart-topping blockbuster for the studio, thanks in part to the refined soulslike action and polished combat that helps drive home some of the most thrilling encounters in gaming history. From the now-iconic battle with Melania to the intense blows traded with Starscourge Radahn, Elden Ring's action is a spectacle of near-impeccable design and gripping gameplay.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/elden-ring\">Metascore: 96</a> | Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-review-death-of-the-wild/1900-6417832/\">Elden Ring review</a></p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/elden-ring-playstation-5/6468170.p?skuId=6468170&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=__ARTICLE_NAME__&amp;article_url=__ARTICLE_URL__&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value\">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>God of War Ragnarok</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4072950-godofwarragnarok.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">God of War 2018's combat systems are a masterclass in satisfying brutality, but Ragnarok takes the thrilling action to the next level. Treating the 2018 game as a template, Ragnarok builds on those ideas with deeper combat mechanics, more variety, and deadlier weapons that turn every encounter into a savage tango of death. Walking a fine line between challenging and power fantasy, God of War Ragnarok delivers cataclysmic axe strikes and dazzling displays of strength in every battle.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/god-of-war-ragnarok\">Metascore: 94</a> | Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-blood-sweat-and-tyrs/1900-6417993/\">God of War Ragnarok review</a></p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/god-of-war-ragnarok-launch-edition-playstation-5/6513126.p?skuId=6513126&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=__ARTICLE_NAME__&amp;article_url=__ARTICLE_URL__&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value\">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Rogue Legacy 2</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4072951-roguelegacy2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">How do you even begin to live up to the legacy set by a game that helped revolutionize the roguelike genre back in 2013? The simple answer is that you don't, as Rogue Legacy 2 takes the ideas of its predecessor and doubles down on what works. That focus on being the best Rogue Legacy that it can be has worked wonders for the sequel, as each run in a dangerous dungeon is a thought-provoking learning experience. With more than a dozen classes, sharp gameplay, and rewarding combat to savor, Rogue Legacy 2 emphasizes fun over revolution, and the direction pays off brilliantly.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/rogue-legacy-2\">Metascore: 90</a> | Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rogue-legacy-2-review-grand-lineage/1900-6417870/\">Rogue Legacy 2 review</a></p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1253920/Rogue_Legacy_2/\">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Neon White</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4072952-neonwhite.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">A speedrunner's delight, Neon White mixes fast-paced combat with limited ammo, acrobatic feats of skill, and bite-sized levels to incredible effect. Once it sinks its fangs into you, this devilish action game runs on pure one-more-turn energy as you memorize a stage, gun for the best time possible, and reset your run to shave precious seconds off of the clock. With its visual novel appeal being a charming tale of saints and sinners battling for a chance at redemption, this fast-paced game is pure heavenly fun.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/neon-white\">Metascore: 90</a> | Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/neon-white-review-heavenly-sprint/1900-6417905/\">Neon White review</a></p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/neon-white-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-oled-model-nintendo-switch-lite-digital/6512654.p?skuId=6512654&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=__ARTICLE_NAME__&amp;article_url=__ARTICLE_URL__&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value\">See on Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4072953-cupheadthedeliciouslastcourse%281%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Some of the best action is brilliant for being both straightforward and nail-biting, two elements that Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course mixes into a scrumptious outing. Improving on the original game with thoughtful tweaks and the inclusion of Ms. Chalice as a playable character, Cuphead's rush of challenging boss fights feel better than ever. That combination of dodging, blasting, and parrying attacks is a treat for your thumbs, and with an art direction that makes the game look like it was pulled from a 1930s cartoon--and somehow even more scrumptiously detailed than the base game--it's pretty easy on your eyes as well.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/cuphead-in-the-delicious-last-course\">Metascore: 89</a> | Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cuphead-the-delicious-last-course-review-more-than-a-cherry-on-top/1900-6417904/\">Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course review</a></p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/cuphead-the-delicious-last-course-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-oled-model-nintendo-switch-lite-digital/6512712.p?skuId=6512712&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=__ARTICLE_NAME__&amp;article_url=__ARTICLE_URL__&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value\">See on Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Horizon Forbidden West</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4072954-horizonforbiddenwest.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">In a distant future where humanity has been replaced by hostile machines at the top of the food chain, you can bet that survivors have learned a few tricks to stay ahead of the mechanical menaces. With Horizon Forbidden West, those tricks include an expanded combat system that focuses on exposing weak points on machines and delivering killer blows.

On one side, you've got a chunky combination of micro-management and land development as you grow your heretical cult, and on the other side, a fun roguelite that hits the sweet spot for growth, violence, and a revolving arsenal. Cult of the Lamb emphasizes experimentation with its delightful inventory of melee and ranged weapons, with each slash and bludgeon of your tools delivering fatal blows and satisfying feedback.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/cult-of-the-lamb\">Metascore: 88</a> | Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cult-of-the-lamb-review-a-cult-classic/1900-6417933/\">Cult of the Lamb review</a></p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/cult-of-the-lamb-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-oled-model-nintendo-switch-lite-digital/6517473.p?skuId=6517473&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=__ARTICLE_NAME__&amp;article_url=__ARTICLE_URL__&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value\">See on Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4072956-unchartedlegacyofthievescollection.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Like the swashbuckling adventure films that it's inspired by, The Uncharted Collection is a two-fisted blast of fun set across a pair of PlayStation games that made their way to PC this year. There's nothing groundbreaking here, but what you will find is a blockbuster ride where bullets and hands regularly fly past you. Delivering some melee retaliation while dodging bullets and explosions looks better than ever on PC, creating a big-budget spectacle that's hard to beat.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection\">Metascore: 88</a> | Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-review-charted-again/1900-6417817/\">Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection review</a></p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection-playstation-5/6491840.p?skuId=6491840&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=__ARTICLE_NAME__&amp;article_url=__ARTICLE_URL__&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value\">See on Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4072957-teenagemutantninjaturtlesshredder%27srevenge1.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">A great game is eternally playable, and with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, DotEmu's pseudo-sequel to a Konami classic is a shell-raising example of how to update retro experiences for modern audiences. If you had any muscle memory in your digits earned through countless hours at the arcade, Shredder's Revenge will make you feel right at home as you start busting some Foot Clan heads. It's the clever enhancements to that gameplay formula where this game shines, as the ability to augment attacks, dodge out of harm's way, and unleash pure co-op carnage makes for a fantastic blend of old and new ideas.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge\">Metascore: 87</a> | Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge-review-turtle-power/1900-6417895/\">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge review</a></p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge-playstation-5/6528550.p?skuId=6528550&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=__ARTICLE_NAME__&amp;article_url=__ARTICLE_URL__&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value\">See on Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Tunic</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4072958-tunic%282%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Tunic definitely looks like a love letter to The Legend of Zelda with its charming isometric viewpoint, hero clad in green, and dungeons to explore, but when it comes to combat, it's a sharp departure from Nintendo's heavyweight franchise. Having more in common with Dark Souls, Tunic's stamina-based action has you juggling meters and well-timed attacks while avoiding devastating counterattacks. That delicate mix of systems and ideas makes you consider each move more carefully, leading to every encounter having a delightful edge to it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/tunic\">Metascore: 86</a> | Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tunic-review-fox-die/1900-6417845/\">Tunic review</a></p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/tunic-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-oled-model-nintendo-switch-lite-digital/6523311.p?skuId=6523311&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=__ARTICLE_NAME__&amp;article_url=__ARTICLE_URL__&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value\">See on Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4072959-monsterhunterrisesunbreak.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike other action games which quickly throw you into the thick of things, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak wants you to be patient. This massive expansion promises more of the same content that made Monster Hunter Rise a runaway success, and that includes deliberately slow grinds as you pursue challenging beasts and find that perfect moment to strike. In the end that's what makes the feel of this DLC so noteworthy, as pulling off a perfect execution of ideas and preparation inside of intense hunts makes for some golden gaming moments.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak\">Metascore: 86</a> | Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-review-sunrise-over-the-kingdom/1900-6417916/\">Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak review</a></p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-nintendo-switch/6505719.p?skuId=6505719&amp;publisher_slug=gamespot&amp;article_name=__ARTICLE_NAME__&amp;article_url=__ARTICLE_URL__&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value\">See on Best Buy</a> </div></div><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bayonetta 3</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4072960-bayonetta3.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The first two Bayonetta games were high-concept action titles that helped put developer Platinum Games on the map, and Bayonetta 3 takes those ideas and dials them up to 11.

Hitting the halfpipes and pulling off some gnarly tricks feels great, but whipping out a gun and firing a few rounds at the opposition helps you land with style and grace in this retro-futuristic world of blood-sports.

They include the return of a beloved mascot character--but in a whole new type of game--as well as a new crime game featuring the most eclectic list of actors we've ever seen. If you ever wonder what a game with Chuck Norris and Vanilla Ice would look like, then we definitely have some good news for you. </p><p>Announcements were varied, including a new Armored Core game, more news on Hideo Kojima's upcoming project, and the long-awaited look at Ken Levine's new project at Ghost Story Games. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Even if you were watching the show live, there is a good chance you didn't get to see everything announced. After all, everyone needs a bathroom break. To help you out, GameSpot rounded up the biggest and best announcements from The Game Awards 2022. Check them out below, and let us know what your favorite moment of the show was.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Final Fantasy XVI</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074261-2810028801-39708.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The show-stopper (except for the last award) of The Game Awards was Final Fantasy XVI, and the trailer focused on the high-octane real-time combat it will feature. Enormous ice meteors crash into the ground, characters wield enormous melee weapons, and others transform into terrifying monsters to battle in kaiju fights. Final Fantasy XVI certainly looks to be cranking everything up to 11, or maybe higher, and we finally know when we can play it. The game launches for PS5 on June 22, 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074264-9167556737-FjgcRFUVUAAH4cp.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>From Software was already up for a whole bunch of awards during The Game Awards, but it showed up with another announcement. <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-announced-at-the-game-awards/1100-6509913/\">Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon</a> was revealed in an exclusive world premiere during the presentation, and it looks quite different from the studio's most famous output--but not different from the studio's past work. In the trailer, we see an enormous wave of red energy soar over a forest, seemingly destroying it and much of the planet. Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is releasing in 2023, bringing its mech action to consoles and PC.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Diablo IV</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1593/15930215/3599656-scosglen_corbach_vista.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-june-2023-release-date-confirmed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6509853/\">Diablo IV</a> was finally given a release date during The Game Awards: June 6, 2023. The game was featured with a cinematic trailer featuring Lilith, who seemed to be putting some sort of enormous, dastardly plan into motion as a bunch of demons fought in a huge battle. Those who preorder Diablo IV will get early beta access. The game is coming to PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Crime Boss: Rockay City</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074270-crimebossthegang.png\" /><br /><h3><p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crime-boss-rockay-city-features-chuck-norris-danny-trejo-michael-rooker-and-more/1100-6509910/\">Crime Boss: Rockay City</a> sounds like a Mad Libs story, but it is definitely real. The cooperative crime first-person shooter features an absolutely absurd cast, including Michael Masden, Chuck Norris, and Vanilla Ice. Yes, we think we're living in a simulation, too. It's not a simulation, however, and we can't wait to see how it all shapes up--including how it will differentiate itself from the reigning champion of cooperative crime shooters, Payday.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074273-6514330315-40718.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-star-wars-jedi-survivor-gameplay-shows-dual-sabers-confirms-march-17-release/1100-6509864/\">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> is coming in 2023, and it was featured with a new trailer during The Game Awards. Cal Kestis is seen in the trailer examining a man suspended in a tube of liquid, who says he will \"not be imprisoned again\" before the trailer cuts to combat footage. Now a much-improved Jedi, Cal is capable of cutting Stormtroopers down to size, and he has plenty of new tricks up his sleeve. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor arrives, complete with Cal's beard, on March 17, 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Baldur's Gate 3</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1574/15746725/3639990-27.png\" /><br /><h3><p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-releases-in-full-in-august-2023-collectors-edition-detailed/1100-6509873/\">Baldur's Gate 3</a> is officially releasing in 2023, which will be nearly three years after it entered early access. In a new trailer, we were introduced to a couple of famous returning characters, and we got a look at the titular city of Baldur's Gate in between very Lovecraftian shots of monsters with far too many tentacles. If you are afraid of spiders or squids, this is not the game for you, but for everyone else, you won't have to wait too much longer to enter Baldur's Gate. The game releases for PC in August 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>After Us</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074274-9266567290-407409.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>A post-apocalyptic game from Piccolo and Private Division, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-us-tasks-you-with-reviving-life-on-a-decimated-earth/1100-6509872/\">After Us</a> isn't your typical brown-and-gray dystopic nightmare. Instead, you play as the last hope for life on Earth, attempting to revive creatures via their spirits. It's coming next spring to PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Hades 2</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074275-2333388388-40741.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Hades developer Supergiant is back with its next game, and it looks every bit as stylish and flat-out cool as its predecessor. <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-by-supergiant-games-announced-at-the-game-awards/1100-6509888/\">Hades 2</a>--yes, Supergiant made a sequel--was teased with an animated trailer that featured a spectral girl fighting against what first appeared to be an evil sorcerer, but then offers her services. The game itself appears to be very similar to the first game, but Kronos is the target this \"time\" around. Like the first one, it's coming first via early access in 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Judas</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074277-5815934355-40741.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">BioShock director Ken Levine is finally ready to share the project he has been working on with Ghost Story. Judas appears to be cut from the same sort of cloth as BioShock, featuring similar powers and weapons, as well as a similar art direction, but it also looks like it'll be taking us into space. The tagline \"Fix what you broke\" appeared at the end of the trailer. <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/judas-new-game-from-the-creators-of-bioshock-announced-at-the-game-awards/1100-6509890/\">Judas</a> is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074278-6804472185-40741.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Bayonetta is back\u2026 again, but this time with a very different sort of game. <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bayonetta-origins-is-an-isometric-storybook-spin-off-of-the-character-action-franchise/1100-6509889/\">Bayonetta Origins</a> is an isometric take on everyone's favorite heroic witch, this time with a little bit of Okami DNA. Taking place when Bayonetta was a child, the game features platforming puzzles and exploration, but it also has plenty of action. It appears Bayonetta, or the girl who would become Bayonetta, was kicking ass before she was out of elementary school. It's coming to Nintendo Switch on March 17.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074279-2299485324-39155.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Rocksteady's upcoming <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kevin-conroy-returns-as-batman-in-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-releasing-in-may/1100-6509892/\">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> was featured during The Game Awards, and it gave us a little tease of Batman. The collective baddies seem to be quite afraid of the Caped Crusader, but a little less afraid of The Flash--who also briefly makes an appearance. The late Kevin Conroy recorded his lines for Batman prior to his death, giving fans once last chance to spend some time with the legendary actor. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League releases on May 26.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Death Stranding 2</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074281-2637781152-FjgGltWXEAEY3gf.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Kojima Productions is back with another very strange game, and it got a sizable presentation during The Game Awards. Lea Seydoux is back as Fragile in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-officially-announced/1100-6509825/\">Death Stranding 2</a>, and in the trailer, we see her attempting to evade dangerous operatives while carrying a baby--who is not inside a tiny pod like the ones we saw in the first game. Riding on a motorcycle, she's quickly attacked and goes tumbling to the ground with her baby a few feet away. Norman Reedus and Troy Baker are also returning, and tehre is a giant robot that looks like a Metal Gear, for some reason. Death Stranding 2 is coming exclusively to PS5.</p></h3></p><br />", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/random-kid-arrested-after-appearing-on-stage-at-the-game-awards/1100-6509914/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Random Kid Arrested After Appearing On Stage At The Game Awards", "date_published": "2022-12-09 04:03:00+00:00", "description": "<p>The Game Awards went pretty much without a hiccup until the very bizarre end.
