Argentina went to hell and back, collapsing deep into second-half stoppage time to squander a two-goal lead after Louis van Gaal\u2019s substitutions combined to wreak havoc. But after a fraught period of extra time Argentina came out on top of a ludicrous bout, with Lautaro Mart\u00ednez scoring the decisive spot-kick in a penalty shootout victory. Lionel Messi\u2019s magical assist and penalty for his 10th World Cup goal, to equal Gabriel Batistuta\u2019s record, finished as footnotes.</p><p>Argentina had to suffer and then some but Mart\u00ednez kept his cool. Argentina had appeared in control but the arrival of Weghorst, a 6ft 6in striker who joined Besiktas on loan from Burnley in the summer, with 78 minutes on the clock undeniably changed the game. With seconds of 10 minutes of second-half stoppage time to play, two of Argentina\u2019s substitutes, German Pezzella and Leandro Paredes, whose poor challenge on Nathan Ak\u00e9 brought a first melee approaching the end of normal time, were lured into sandwiching Weghorst on the edge of the box as the trio contested an aerial ball. And then the Dutch got inventive. Teun Koopmeiners, also a late substitute, shaped to shoot from the subsequent free-kick but instead cannoned the ball into the feet of Weghorst, who rolled his marker and promptly prodded the ball into the far corner.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/09/netherlands-argentina-world-cup-quarter-final-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/09/gary-gold-us-eagles-coach-rugby-world-cup", "title": "Gary Gold steps down as US Eagles coach after Rugby World Cup failure", "date_published": "2022-12-09 21:22:44+00:00", "description": "<p>South African to support review of US high performance programmes as 2031 and 2033 World Cup host looks to rebuild</p><p>The former South Africa assistant coach Gary Gold will step down as head coach of the US Eagles, USA Rugby said on Friday, three weeks after the team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/19/us-rugby-in-despair-after-world-cup-flop-but-eagles-insist-on-signs-of-hope\">failed to qualify</a> for the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France.</p><p>In a statement, Ross Young, chief executive of USA Rugby, thanked Gold \u201cfor his dedication, passion and service\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/09/gary-gold-us-eagles-coach-rugby-world-cup\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/09/england-v-france-a-heavyweight-contest-to-define-the-southgate-era", "title": "England v France: a heavyweight contest to define the Southgate era", "date_published": "2022-12-09 21:00:44+00:00", "description": "<p>World Cup knockout games are devastatingly brutal in their finality but at least this showdown looks intriguingly poised</p><p>Darkness falls quickly in Qatar.

A charmingly unkempt Al Pacino arrived on stage to present the award for best performance, quickly admitting that he neither played \u201ca whole lot of video games\u201d nor could read the teleprompter especially well. Still, he managed to hand the gong out to actor Christopher Judge for his electrifying performance as Kratos in God of War Ragnar\u00f6k. Dressed in a sparkling gold suit, Judge began his moment in the sun by hugging the Hollywood star. This was just the start of a further 10 heartfelt minutes on stage, the actor relaying the personal anguish he went through leading up to the game\u2019s production. As the minutes wore on, the show\u2019s producers seemingly began to fret about the night\u2019s schedule, eventually playing orchestral music in an attempt to hurry him along. Yet this only made Judge\u2019s words more epic \u2013 all the more affecting.</p><p>Judge\u2019s time on stage was a rare moment of spontaneity and personality in a three-hour awards show otherwise sorely lacking these ingredients.

However, this year\u2019s glitzy event continued to show the extent to which the Game awards lack balance. The length of time given to the awards and their winners was dwarfed by that allocated for what the show calls \u201cworld premiere\u201d trailers of new and announced games. The awards should be a celebration of the year\u2019s interactive excellence yet the evening demonstrated the extent to which it remains fixated on a hype-filled future, often to the detriment of the creators it purports to recognise.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/dec/09/the-game-awards-three-patience-testing-hours-of-video-game-advertorials\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/09/government-to-weaken-water-pollution-goals-river-health", "title": "Government to weaken water pollution goals in \u2018attack on nature\u2019", "date_published": "2022-12-09 14:11:16+00:00", "description": "<p>Exclusive: Despite demands from water campaigners, there will be no overall target for river health</p><p>Water pollution goals are to be weakened by the government next week, the Guardian can reveal, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/28/ministers-admit-delays-will-cause-government-to-breach-environment-act\">Environment Act targets</a> will give farmers three extra years to reduce their waste dumping into waterways.</p><p>River campaigners have said the news is proof the government has not dropped its \u201cattack on nature\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/09/government-to-weaken-water-pollution-goals-river-health\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/09/chester-zoo-birth-malayan-tapir-nessa", "title": "Chester zoo hails birth of rare Malayan tapir as \u2018important moment\u2019", "date_published": "2022-12-09 14:05:14+00:00", "description": "<p>Female calf named Nessa will help efforts to protect species, of which fewer than 2,500 remain in the wild</p><p>An endangered Malayan tapir has been born at a UK zoo, in what the zoo said was an \u201cimportant moment\u201d for conservation.</p><p>The female calf, which zookeepers have named Nessa, was born weighing 9kg on Wednesday at Chester zoo, one of only two places in the country to keep tapirs, a species related to the horse and the rhinoceros.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/09/chester-zoo-birth-malayan-tapir-nessa\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/09/portugal-coach-cristiano-ronaldo-frank-conversation-dropping-him-world-cup-fernando-santos", "title": "Portugal coach had \u2018frank conversation\u2019 with Ronaldo over dropping him", "date_published": "2022-12-09 14:03:14+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>Fernando Santos says Ronaldo not happy and queried decision</li><li>Santos defends Ronaldo over behaviour before Morocco game</li></ul><p>Portugal\u2019s coach, Fernando Santos, has revealed he had a \u201cfrank conversation\u201d with Cristiano Ronaldo to explain why he was dropping him.</p><p>Ronaldo was on the bench for the 6-1 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/06/portugal-switzerland-world-cup-last-16-match-report\">last-16 win over Switzerland</a>, coming on in the closing stages as Portugal secured a quarter-final on Saturday against Morocco.

She was right to be concerned; exactly two years earlier she had taken me to see Larry Cohen\u2019s horror film It Lives Again \u2013 his sequel to It\u2019s Alive \u2013 and the experience had caused more than a year of traumatic, recurring nightmares.

The Shining penetrated my psyche in a way I had never experienced, and it was intoxicating. Like Danny Torrance, I was an only child whose parents were entangled in a dysfunctional marriage.

Also that summer, I read Will There Really Be a Morning, the autobiography of Frances Farmer. The book is the brutal story of Farmer, an actor, who was committed to a psychiatric hospital. The fear of incarceration, of mental illness, of not being seen for who one is, of being so disappointing or frightening to one\u2019s own family that they send you away, was terrifying.

There is even a <a href=\"https://warpoetry.mkip.gov.ua/\">Ukrainian government website</a> that encourages members of the public to upload their work. \u201cEvery poem, every line, every word is part of Ukrainian history,\u201d the site says. \u201cWe know for sure that wars end, but poetry does not.\u201d At the time of writing, more than 24,000 poems had been added to the site.</p><p>\u201cIt is true that when Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion started on 24 February, literature was the last thing on people\u2019s minds \u2013 \u201cyou could not protect your family from a rifle with your poems\u201d, as the writer Oleksandr Mykhed put it. But as the conflict has continued, the power of writing to record, to testify and to witness has seemed more and more important. Many Ukrainians started to keep diaries, the \u201cfirst responder\u201d, perhaps, among literary genres, able to gather experience and emotion in its rawest form. But in surprising numbers, Ukrainians are also turning to poetry, while setting aside for the time being that time-greedy literary form, the novel. \u201cIt\u2019s the condensation, the density of it, the way that you can arrange words so that they carry a lot,\u201d explains Max Rosochinsky who, with Maksymchuk, is co-editor of an anthology of Ukrainian poems, <a href=\"https://www.wordsforwar.com/\">Words for War</a>, born from the conflict that began in 2014 with Russian annexations in the Donbas and Crimea.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/09/for-ukrainians-poetry-isnt-a-luxury-its-a-necessity-during-war\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/09/peyote-native-american-medicine-nacna-federal-protection", "title": "Inside the battle to save the sacred peyote ceremony: \u2018We\u2019re in dire straits\u2019", "date_published": "2022-12-09 07:00:17+00:00", "description": "<p>Used in Native religious ceremonies but now adopted by A-list celebrities, the cactus is threatened by land development and over-harvesting</p><p>Earlier this fall, leaders of the Native American Church of North America (Nacna) made a historic trip to Washington DC to meet with lawmakers about the need to protect peyote \u2013 and, with it, the faith of hundreds of thousands of Native people.</p><p>Over the course of three days, they sat down with more than 20 lawmakers, federal officials and representatives from the Biden administration.
