You may not notice because it's the <em>New York Times</em> and you line the litterbox with the <em>Washington Post</em>. But, yeah. It's over some union nonsense. They wanted people to promise not to click any NYT links on Thursday in solitary. I was tempted to click all the links out of spite like a cyber SCAB. Then I found more entertaining things, like <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mask-fight-too-close\" target=\"_blank\">the latest mask meltdown</a> and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/piers-morgan-eat-steak-vegan\" target=\"_blank\">laughing at vegans</a>.</p><p>Fox News caught up to the lazy workers and gave them a platform to air their grievances. Among the usual whining, they are upset they have to go to an office five days a week. There is an overarching theme this week of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brittney-griner-biden-paul-whelan\" target=\"_blank\">leftists not realizing how their words sound</a> to normies.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Fox News interviewed a bunch of New York Times employees on strike and it's just as ridiculous as you will imagine:<br /><br />\"We find it ridiculous that the company is maintaining its position that is has a unilateral right to call us back into the office 5 days a week.\" <a href=\"https://t.co/Mm46tQ4vLB\">pic.twitter.com/Mm46tQ4vLB</a><br />\u2014 Greg Price (@greg_price11) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1601006811565658112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 9, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>This is quite an impressive collection of words.

Prior to hearing such an outcry about having to go to an office, I had thought <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/12/08/2022/new-york-times-dc-reporters-refuse-to-strike\" target=\"_blank\">these bars would be the silliest thing</a> I read about the strike:</p><blockquote>The rift in the powerful Washington bureau reflects a lingering generational and ideological divide between many in the newsroom and a smaller group of older unionized staff...some staff believe the union should focus more on compensation and other concrete worker protections, and less on broader <strong>cultural and social issues that have also been part of the union\u2019s bargaining proposals</strong>.</blockquote><p>It would be nice to see the striking workers have a conversation with someone outside of NYC or DC who is forced to go to an office five days a week because they are an adult and that's what adults do. But if anyone on the picket line cared about other Americans, they wouldn't be the New York Times.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
