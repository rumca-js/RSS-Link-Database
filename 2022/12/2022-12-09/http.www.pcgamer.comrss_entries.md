<p>Announced at The Game Awards this evening in a spectacular cinematic trailer, Diablo 4 will arrive on PC on June 6, 2023. Blizzard also opened <a href="https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-us/#pre-purchase" target="_blank">pre-ordering</a> for Diablo 4, which will grant some amount of early access to the game.</p><p>I thought the trailer was excellent: Diablo&apos;s depiction of the ancient battle between good an evil resonates with strangely realistic horror. The new video follows-up the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/diablo-4-trailer/" target="_blank">grisly announcement trailer</a> first seen at the BlizzCon 2019 opening ceremony, we see Diablo&apos;s avenging angel Tyrael floating above lines of holy soldiers in formation, with spears and shields knit into an impenetrable line. Running headlong into this human wall are Lilith&apos;s demons.</p><p>We&apos;ve already played some Diablo 4, with PC Gamer editor Tyler Colp calling it <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/diablo-4-preview/">"the Diablo I&apos;ve been waiting for."</a> </p><p>"Diablo 4 reminds me why other action-RPGs don&apos;t do it for me," Tyler wrote in his preview yesterday. "It either takes too long to earn enough abilities to formulate a plan or they drop so many on you that it&apos;s overwhelming. Blizzard knows exactly how quickly to fill your spellbook and when to introduce a new wrinkle to get you thinking." </p><p>Diablo 4 will launch simultaneously on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.</p>
