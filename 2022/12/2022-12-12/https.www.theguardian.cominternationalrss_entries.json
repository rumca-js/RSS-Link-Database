I remember it was fun being out at night, but I also remember how powerful the music was, and how I feel I\u2019ve always recognised his very unique sound on his saxophone. It\u2019s like something from the cosmos: raspy, but super-soulful and pure, at times very beautiful, almost sweet, but he also adds lots of details like growls, without it ever sounding harsh. And his skill was beyond any type of technical comprehension. He could play something bluesy and spiritual, then just move into these incredible flurries of notes, like he was suddenly flying through clouds of supernova dust.</p><p>My dad, a big jazz fan, made sure that I kind of understood where Pharoah\u2019s music came from. I knew how he was once homeless, how Sun Ra gave him a place to stay, and how he became such a huge part of John Coltrane\u2019s band. Losing Coltrane so young [of cancer, at 40, in 1967] must have been like losing the sun in the sky. But you can hear a difference in John Coltrane as well when Pharoah started playing with him. Anyone who was around Pharoah as a musician can\u2019t have failed but be influenced.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/12/obituaries-2022-pharoah-sanders-remembered-by-kamasi-washington\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2022/dec/12/crossword-blog-american-style-puzzle-no-16-lets-try-again", "title": "Crossword blog: American-style puzzle No 16 \u2013 Let\u2019s Try Again", "date_published": "2022-12-12 17:48:44+00:00", "description": "<p>Another puzzle in our American-style series \u2013 along with some tips on how to tackle it</p><p>Here\u2019s another puzzle in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/american-style\">our American-style series</a>, in <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2022/12/12/american_puzzle_016.puz\">digital</a> and <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2022/12/12/american_puzzle_016.pdf\">printable</a> form.</p><p>This year, I\u2019ve gone to puzzles more challenging still than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2021/dec/22/crossword-blog-american-style-puzzle-no-15-whats-next\">those I mentioned last year</a>: the Saturday Stumpers in the <a href=\"https://www.newsday.com/\">Newsday</a> newspaper.

Worse, researchers who examined the consequences of the UK going fully organic concluded it would increase greenhouse gas emissions and reduce biodiversity.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/12/the-big-idea-has-organic-food-passed-its-sell-by-date\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/12/kim-jong-un-dogs-end-up-at-south-korean-zoo-after-care-costs-row", "title": "Kim Jong-un dogs end up at South Korean zoo after care costs row", "date_published": "2022-12-12 12:15:20+00:00", "description": "<p>Moon Jae-in gave up hunting dogs claiming government refused to cover  food and veterinary bills</p><p>A pair of dogs gifted four years ago by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, have ended up at a zoo in South Korea after a dispute over who should pay for the animals\u2019 care.</p><p>Kim had given the two white Pungsan hunting dogs \u2013 a breed indigenous to North Korea \u2013 to the then-South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, as a gift after their summit talks in Pyongyang in 2018.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/12/kim-jong-un-dogs-end-up-at-south-korean-zoo-after-care-costs-row\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/12/hong-kong-google-protest-anthem-searches-china", "title": "Hong Kong pressures Google to remove protest anthem from searches", "date_published": "2022-12-12 12:03:57+00:00", "description": "<p>Authorities want Glory to Hong Kong axed from top results and replaced with China\u2019s national anthem</p><p>Google has refused to change its search results to display China\u2019s national anthem, rather than a protest song, when users search for Hong Kong\u2019s national anthem, the city\u2019s security chief has said, expressing \u201cgreat regret\u201d at the decision.</p><p>Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet Inc, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/12/hong-kong-google-protest-anthem-searches-china\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/12/saint-omer-alice-diop-best-movies-2022", "title": "Best movies of 2022 in the US: No 10 \u2013 Saint Omer", "date_published": "2022-12-12 12:00:01+00:00", "description": "<p>Alice Diop\u2019s award-winning courtroom drama doubles as an unsentimental study in empathy with one of the year\u2019s most mesmerising performances</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/06/the-50-best-movies-films-of-2022-in-the-us\">50 best movies of 2022 in the US</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/2022-in-culture\">More on the best culture of 2022</a></li></ul><p>At this year\u2019s Venice film festival, Alice Diop\u2019s unblinking stunner Saint Omer was handed the prize for best debut film \u2013 a reward that would have seemed inadequate if it hadn\u2019t shortly afterwards taken the grand prix in the main competition, and inaccurate under any circumstances. Diop\u2019s film is only a debut if you\u2019re happy to disregard documentary as a lesser branch of cinema that somehow doesn\u2019t count; as her first dramatic feature, Saint Omer merely extends the clear-eyed gaze and burning social interest of her non-fiction work into new narrative terrain, with nary a tremor of uncertainty.

The case, drawn from a real-life 2016 headline-maker in France, is stark and horrifying: legally straightforward, perhaps, but psychologically tumultuous.

It is more complicated than that. When he died, huge numbers of people wanted to say farewell to him at the Hall of Columns in the centre of Moscow. The state organisers of the funeral had told us we shouldn\u2019t allocate too much time for the farewell. But thousands upon thousands of people did come. Gorbachev\u2019s daughter, Irina, said that she would sit in that big hall, where he was lying in state, as long as people still wanted to come. She was there for many hours.</p><p>I started working as Gorbachev\u2019s translator when I was 36, in 1985. I was with him through all the negotiations on ending the cold war and the nuclear arms race. But the real friendship between us started after he had stepped down in 1991 and I continued as his translator and adviser for international and media relations. He didn\u2019t travel with a huge retinue of people. So for nearly 30 years I was involved in just about everything, from checking in at the hotel, to meetings with US presidents and the British prime ministers. I witnessed him, too, as a husband and a father and grandfather at the heart of their wonderful family. And I saw him practically every day in the office, until his health began to decline. Even until the end of last year, he was still active from his hospital room, responding to requests for articles, reactions to events.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/12/obituaries-2022-mikhail-gorbachev-remembered-by-pavel-palazhchenko\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/12/the-50-best-albums-of-2022-no-10-nilufer-yanya-painless", "title": "The 50 best albums of 2022: No 10 \u2013 Nil\u00fcfer Yanya: Painless", "date_published": "2022-12-12 10:00:04+00:00", "description": "<p>The bracing and compulsive follow-up to 2019\u2019s raved-about Miss Universe saw the genre-dabbling London guitarist confidently refining her sound</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/06/the-50-best-albums-of-2022\">The 50 best albums of 2022</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/05/the-20-best-songs-of-2022\">The best songs of 2022</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/2022-in-culture\">More of the best culture of 2022</a></li></ul><p>Nil\u00fcfer Yanya has always thrilled by keeping us guessing.

This one took longer to needle its way under my skin than her debut did, but when it got there, it hooked on and refused to let go. What it lacks in immediacy it more than makes up for in directness, and its after effects linger long past its lean running time. This is a more muscular version of Yanya\u2019s sound, with more space and fewer adornments.
