<p>With the success of Souls games like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dark-souls-3-pc-servers-are-finally-back-online-seven-months-later-202533974.html"><em>Dark Souls III </em></a>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elden-ring-12-million-copies-18-days-105555964.html"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, you'd think FromSoftware would incorporate some of the gameplay into other titles... right? Not so. From president Hidetaka Miyazaki told <em>IGN</em> in an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/armored-core-6-interview">interview</a> that there's no "conscious effort" to add Souls-style elements to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fromsoftware-armored-core-vi-bandai-namco-040900986.html"><em>Armored Core VI</em></a>. Instead, the studio is eager to to stick what makes the Armored Core series "special" — that is, creating a custom mech and taking it into battle. There will still be a mission-driven structure, even if there are elements of exploration.</p><p>The new title is a "reboot" will take advantage of greatly expanded resources to build the game From "wanted to make," Miyazaki said. The team's Masaru Yamamura added that there will be a "fresh new story,"but that the game will remain challenging. While you'll find a versus multiplayer mode like in earlier Armored Core projects, details of that are under wraps for now.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Armored Core VI</em> is due in 2023 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. It will be the first mainline game in the franchise since 2012. After its announcement at The Game Awards, creators like <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PTNEVVZ5QkxMTlBZIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2NWU3OTgzZi1mOWViLTQyMWUtODRhZS0yZTRiY2NhMjY1NzIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASxWd_LVk6oUW222jfPKsGhSV1oxUVrKzlQY8Xyjy6lM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D3DUVyBLLNPY">VaatiVidya</a> speculated that the new battler would effectively be a Souls game with mechs. That's clearly not happening, then.</p><p>Whether or not it's a good strategy is another matter. <em>Armored Core V</em> had a mixed reception — this won't be the follow-up to a much-loved predecessor like <em>Bloodborne</em> or the Dark Souls series. A lot has changed at From over the course of a decade, mind you, so it won't be surprising if <em>VI</em> reflects some lessons learned.</p>

## Netflix is producing a live action 'My Hero Academia' movie

<p>Netflix's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-29-netflix-one-piece-live-action.html">penchant</a> for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-22-netflixs-big-budget-death-note-remake-lands-on-august-25th.html">live-action manga remakes</a> isn't going away any time soon. The streaming service has <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-boards-my-hero-academia-feature-film-from-legendary-entertainment">revealed</a> that it's partnering with Legendary Entertainment on a live action <em>My Hero Academia</em> movie. Anime and manga adaptation veteran Shinsuke Sato (<em>Alice in Borderland</em>, <em>Bleach</em>) will both direct and executive produce, while <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em>'s Joby Harold is writing the screenplay.</p><p>The manga and the anime it fostered both revolve around Deku, a boy who aches to join the UA High School and become a superhero despite missing the natural powers that most humans have by that point.  Both the manga and the still-running anime offshoot have been successful, with the manga racking up over 65 million sales so far.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There's no mention of casting or a release window for the Netflix project. Toho, which handles the anime, will distribute the movie to Japanese theatres. As <em>IndieWire</em><a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2022/12/my-hero-academia-live-action-film-netflix-1234791048/">explains</a>, this comes four years after Legendary said a movie was in the works.</p><p>As with earlier adaptations, Netflix has multiple incentives to create a <em>My Hero Academia</em> title. It's tapping into a large fanbase, sometimes for anime productions it already offers. This also gives it a way to reel in customers who would otherwise stick to anime-centric rivals like Crunchyroll, which recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/crunchyroll-monthly-price-subscription-lower-anime-streaming-155530315.html">lowered prices</a> in some countries.</p><p>Whether or not it'll be worth watching is another matter. Netflix doesn't have the best track record for live action takes on manga and anime. The <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> series <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cowboy-bebop-review-netflix-191548307.html">misunderstood its source material</a> and generally struggled despite a top-tier cast and intriguing premise. There's also the question of the format. A movie doesn't allow as much room for story development as an episodic show, so <em>My Hero Academia</em> may have to rush through the narrative.</p>

Meanwhile, whether because of Will Smith’s damaged reputation or the movie itself, Apple TV+ film <em>Emancipation</em> was also left out.</p><p>Winners will be announced at the 2023 Golden Globes ceremony on January 10th, starting at 8 PM ET. The show will air on NBC and Peacock with comedian Jerrod Carmichael as host.</p>

<p>When Lyft first pledged to go <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lyft-commits-all-electric-vehicles-2030-173706183.html">fully electric by the end of 2030</a>, the company detailed a plan that involved an “extremely hard” push on incentives for drivers. Now, more than two years later, the company is <a href="https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/lyft-helps-drivers-switch-to-electric-vehicles">rolling out a new EV bundle</a> to encourage drivers to switch.</p><p>To start, drivers in California can earn an extra $150 every week through the end of 2024 by completing 50 weekly rides with their personal EVs. You can find more information on the EV Ride Challenge over on <a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/all/articles/2803727495-Ev-Ride-Challenge">Lyft’s website</a>, but important details include a December 31st, 2023, deadline to register and a total individual earnings limit of $8,100.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Because California is currently Lyft’s largest EV market, the company is using it as a testing ground to understand the best ways to help drivers transition,” a Lyft spokesperson <a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/local/austin/lyft-rolls-out-new-incentives-for-electric-vehicle-drivers/">told NBC affiliate KXAN</a>. “From there, Lyft can take learnings to other states across the country.”</p><p>To that point, the other incentives Lyft announced today are available nationwide. First, there’s a discount for drivers who charge their cars through <a href="https://www.evgo.com/lyft/">EVgo</a>. In select markets, Gold and Platinum drivers can get up to 45 percent off the company’s Pay As You Go rates starting this week. To begin taking advantage of the discounts, you’ll need to link your Lyft Rewards and EVgo accounts.</p><p>Drivers with Lyft Direct debit cards can get cashback at public charging stations. The amount will depend on the individual’s Lyft Rewards standing, with Platinum members entitled to a 7 percent return, while Gold and Silver drivers get a more modest 3 percent and 2 percent back. Everyone else can get 1 percent back at stations that accept Mastercard. Lastly, Lyft has partnered with <a href="https://wallbox.com/">Wallbox</a> to offer drivers discounts on at-home Level 2 charging hardware. The company is also working with <a href="https://coiliq.com/lyft">COIL</a> to secure pre-negotiated rates for installation.</p><p>“We know many drivers on Lyft want to switch to EVs, which is why we’re focused on addressing the biggest barriers they face in transitioning: upfront costs and access to charging,” said Paul Augustine, Lyft’s director of sustainability. “These offerings are the latest in many steps we are taking to support drivers in switching to an EV on Lyft,”</p><p>On Monday, the company also announced it’s on track to add “thousands” of new EVs to its <a href="https://www.lyft.com/expressdrive">Express Drive rental program</a> next year. Lyft previously announced it was aiming to only acquire electric vehicles for the program by 2026, and phase out any remaining internal combustion engine cars by 2028.</p>

## LG’s first 27-inch OLED gaming monitor arrives in January for $1,000

<p>A few weeks ago, LG announced its latest UltraGear gaming monitor, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZy5jb20vdXMvbW9uaXRvcnMvbGctMjdncjk1cWUtYiMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImY1MGU5MzJmLTdkNmMtNGJlMi1iM2YwLTEyMThmNGFhMjg1NyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUxsWJryVCQ-TTva9l8c4VAvXS1S4oAFIQa71Hbnz6eG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fmonitors%2Flg-27gr95qe-b%23"><ins>27GR95QE</ins></a>. Behind the unassuming model number is a display that has a lot of buzz around it. That’s because the spec sheet of the 27GR95QE reads like every monitor wishlist you’ve probably seen in the last few years. It features a flat 27-inch OLED panel with a 2560 x 1440 resolution, a claimed 0.03 millisecond gray-to-gray response time and 98.5 percent DCI-P3 coverage.</p><p>A native 240Hz refresh rate makes the 27GR95QE ideal for competitive gaming, but the monitor also comes with AMD FreeSync Premium support and NVIDIA G-Sync Compatible certification. It even includes a VESA Adaptive-Sync badge for good measure. All of that branding means the 27GR95QE is also a good fit for games where your GPU can’t deliver a constant 240 frames per second.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you want to use the 27GR95QE for current-generation console gaming, you can, thanks to the inclusion of two HDMI 2.1 ports. With HDR10 support and a 1,500,000 to one contrast ratio, it should also make for a good multimedia display. That said, I’ll note here LG’s website doesn’t mention what <a href="https://displayhdr.org/"><ins>DisplayHDR</ins></a> certification the 27GR95QE earned and it peaks at a modest 200 nits of brightness, so it’s hard to say what kind of performance you can expect on the HDR front.</p><figure><img alt="LG UltraGear ultrawide" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/946da860-7a45-11ed-bed7-0db272085284" style="height: 1000; width: 1600;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure><p>All of that brings us to today, with LG finally sharing US pricing and availability for the 27GR95QE. The monitor will cost $1,000 when it ships in January. That’s a fair bit more than you would pay for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-alienware-aw-2723-df-and-aw2523hf-announced-specs-pricing-availability-130007828.html"><ins>similar LED display</ins></a>, but then you miss out on all the advantages that come with an OLED panel.

Right now it's seeing a 42 percent discount at GoPro's website when you bundle it with a GoPro subscription. By itself, the camera goes for $400, but when you add the $50 yearly subscription, GoPro will knock $150 off the price. As part of GoPro's holiday sale, when you add the camera to your cart, you'll see an additional 15 percent discount. That brings the total for the camera plus the subscription down to $262.50.

True, it only has a small status-only display instead of a touchscreen, there's no photo mode and the unit did get a bit hot shooting in 5.3K at 60fps indoors. That said, you can control the Mini via the app on your phone, you can pull stills from video to get around the no-photo-mode limitation and the overheating disappears when shooting at lower definitions.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Limitations aside, where the camera excels is as a helmet- or body-mounted action cam, or as a secondary shot-getter. It has a second pair of mounting fingers that make it easier to face the camera forward and it includes many of the features — like horizon lock and Hyperview mode — that make its larger sibling so capable. Battery-wise, we got about a hour of continuous recording at the highest quality and almost two hours recording at lower definitions.</p><p>It's worth noting that the larger camera, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06fa1f29-e83c-49e4-81a8-9732450da8a9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GoPro&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwNmZhMWYyOS1lODNjLTQ5ZTQtODFhOC05NzMyNDUwZGE4YTkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9nb3Byby5jb20vZW4vdXMvc2hvcC9jYW1lcmFzL2hlcm8xMS1ibGFjay9DSERIWC0xMTEtbWFzdGVyLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjhlZGJkNDRlLTgyYjEtNDRiYi1hODQ0LTlmMmE1OTFjYTljNyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYnZfRDNadrOc_J6TKstpJkaA0EOFo8WzbAMqMWDK9B_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fgopro.com%2Fen%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fcameras%2Fhero11-black%2FCHDHX-111-master.html">Hero 11 Black</a> is also $150 off with a GoPro subscription and is also getting that extra 15 percent off at checkout.

<p>In a world where most laptops are entirely sealed, with no real way to tweak the hardware, Framework’s modular devices stand out. The company’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/framework-laptop-review-150001399.html">first Windows laptop was a solid computer</a> considering the price – and that’s before you factor in the fact that you could swap ports, easily add more storage or RAM or even upgrade the processor down the line.</p><p>It’s been a little over a year since the first Framework laptops launched, and now the company has a new model, the Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition (which I'll refer to as the Framework Chromebook from here on out). It offers the same benefits as its Windows sibling – namely, solid industrial design and specs coupled with the promise of customization and future expandability. That said, it’s also one of the more expensive Chromebooks available, starting at $999. That’s a lot of money for a Chromebook – but if it can last you five years or more, it might be worth the cost.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="8a70bdb1faed40cbbcb2ee6993908ea5"></div><h2>Hardware</h2><p>Visually, the Framework Chromebook has little to distinguish it. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it is very utilitarian, with a silver aluminum chassis that resembles so many other devices out there. Still, it’s a pretty compact device, less than two-thirds of an inch thick and weighing under three pounds. A classy reflective Framework logo on the lid is the only thing distinguishing it from an Acer, ASUS and other brands’ laptops.</p><p>A day or two later, I discovered that the Framework Chromebook <em>does</em> have one bit of flair: the black bezel around the screen is magnetic and easily removable. Framework actually provided me with a fun orange option, which I left on. You can also get a silver bezel if you want, but orange is a personal favorite. I’m hoping the company adds a few more colors in the future as well.</p><p>Inside that bezel is a 1080p webcam that’s totally fine for video calling. Also of interest is the fact that there are hardware switches for disabling the camera and microphones. This isn’t just a software trick either; the switches actually cut the power to those modules, making it a fairly secure option (though a physical cover over the camera would be pretty impenetrable, too).</p><figure><img alt="Photos of Framework's first modular and repairable Chromebook." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/9438a290-7a2d-11ed-bfb9-d2eaded0b4e9" style="height: 1600; width: 2400;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>While Framework devices are upgradeable, a few things are more permanent – namely, the display and keyboard. (You can replace both if they break, but there aren’t more advanced versions to upgrade your laptop with at this time. That could change, of course). Fortunately, both are excellent, as you’d hope for in a laptop at this price. The 13.5-inch display has a high resolution of 2,256 x 1,504, which translates to&nbsp; a taller 3:2 aspect ratio that I wish were more common.</p><p>The main downside is that it’s not a touchscreen, something you’ll find on most Chromebooks. That makes installing touch-driven Android apps less appealing, though at this point most of the apps I use (Lightroom, Todoist, Spotify and video apps like Netflix) work fine with a keyboard and mouse. That minor disappointment aside, the screen is great. Text and images are sharp, and its 400-nit max brightness is more than sufficient unless you have sunlight coming through and shining right on the display.</p><figure><img alt="Photos of Framework's first modular and repairable Chromebook." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/943b88c0-7a2d-11ed-b77f-3c249391e8c9" style="height: 1600; width: 2400;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>As you’d expect, Framework swapped out the Windows keyboard layout for one that will feel familiar to Chromebook users, with the “everything” button on the left in place of caps lock and the function row shortcuts like back, refresh and screenshot right where I expected. There’s no Google Assistant key, but you can easily access the Assistant in the ChromeOS search bar if you’re so inclined. The keyboard itself is excellent; the backlit buttons have 1.5mm of travel and are solid and precise. The key caps are a bit small, but it didn’t take me long to adjust. I do wish that Framework included the fingerprint sensor found on its Windows laptop, though. Given that plenty of other Chromebooks support fingerprint unlocking, I’m surprised it isn’t available here.</p><p>At $999, the Framework Chromebook isn’t cheap, but the company didn’t spare any expense with the processor. It features Intel’s 12th-generation Core i5-1240P CPU, along with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage on the base model. Most Chromebooks with comparable specs are similarly priced, so Framework’s laptop isn’t excessively expensive – but the question, as always, is whether spending that much money on a ChromeOS device is a good idea at all.</p><section><img alt="Photos of Framework's first modular and repairable Chromebook." class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/9451a8d0-7a2d-11ed-afff-7369236a1f6e" /></section><h2>Swappable ports and expansion</h2><p>Let’s get into what makes the Framework Chromebook unique. Instead of having a set of unchangeable ports, there are four slots for user-selectable Expansion Cards. Framework offers sockets for USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, DisplayPort, Ethernet and microSD. Additionally, you can use those connections for easily-swappable storage; Framework offers 250GB and 1TB modules. All the Expansion Cards are USB-C based; the ports on the laptop itself are just four recessed USB-C openings. This means you could use the storage cards with other computers to easily move files around.</p><p>I went with two USB-C ports (one on each side), USB-A and HDMI. Framework helpfully included an LED light on each side of the laptop so you confirm when you’re charging and when the battery is full. Everything functioned as I would have expected: the HDMI port worked just fine with my external monitor, and my old USB-A flash drive showed up with no issues. I also tested out the Ethernet Expansion Card, which was plug-and-play simple (though it’s bigger than the other cards and thus sticks out of the side of the machine).</p><figure><img alt="Photos of Framework's first modular and repairable Chromebook." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/943bafd0-7a2d-11ed-9fbd-d643551d1e49" style="height: 1600; width: 2400;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>I’m of two minds when it comes to these modules. On the one hand, the ability to customize what ports are available on your computer is pretty damn cool. If I used microSD or Ethernet more, for example, I’d love the ability to swap those in, or just load up on USB-C ports if I had a lot of compatible peripherals. But there are also plenty of Chromebooks that have USB-A, HDMI and microSD slots, which makes the Framework’s modular slots a little less compelling to me.</p><p>However, the fact that <em>my </em>needs are modest doesn’t change the fact that there are probably lots of people who want more flexibility in their laptop. Being able to drop an Ethernet port in for when you’re doing a lot of downloading and then swap it for USB-A if you’re hooking up older accessories is undeniably useful. It also future-proofs this laptop quite a bit. If you get rid of all your USB-A gadgets, for example, just throw in another UBC-C port or add more storage. There are tons of possibilities here that you just don’t get from a standard laptop.</p><section><img alt="Photos of Framework's first modular and repairable Chromebook." class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/944c51a0-7a2d-11ed-bfdf-fe7911c250f6" /></section><p>These swappable ports are only one facet of the Framework Chromebook’s flexibility. Using the included Torx T5 screwdriver, I was able to loosen the five screws on the underside of the laptop and then lift the keyboard deck right off, exposing the laptop’s innards. It’s all laid out clearly and everything is labeled, and there are QR codes you can scan to go directly to upgrade guides. I didn’t change much under the hood, but Framework provided me with a second 8GB memory chip that I was able to install in about five minutes. I can’t remember the last time I’ve been able to upgrade my laptop’s RAM like this, and with two slots I could shove in up to 64GB of memory. That’s something that will make this Chromebook a useful machine for a long time.</p><p>And that’s to say nothing about upgrading the processor. The Framework Chromebook has Intel’s latest-gen chip on board, so there’s no need to change it now. But, Framework has already started offering new “mainboards” for its Windows laptop, which originally shipped with an 11th-generation Intel CPU. It seems likely that in a few years, when Intel has newer chips available, Framework will let you swap them in and give your old laptop a nice performance bump.</p><p>Another cool point about the swappable mainboard is the fact that if you decide ChromeOS isn’t for you, you could pick up a Windows-compatible mainboard and move on with your life running Microsoft’s OS. Framework says that the Chromebook has some ChromeOS-specific parts and firmware, which is why you can’t just wipe the device and install Windows. But being able to swap the mainboard and keyboard for Windows-compatible is another example of the customization at the heart of Framework.</p><figure><img alt="Photos of Framework's first modular and repairable Chromebook." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/943bafd0-7a2d-11ed-bdfb-087d422dbb5d" style="height: 1600; width: 2400;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2>In use</h2><p>As you’d expect, using the Framework Chromebook was basically identical to any other Chromebook with these specs. It’s a snappy, responsive laptop that can handle basically anything you might want to do in ChromeOS, including those aforementioned Android apps as well as web apps and a ton of Chrome tabs.</p><p>Battery life is the main downside here. I only got a little over six hours unplugged doing my normal work routine, and the battery lasted about eight hours and 15 minutes when looping playback of an HD video stored locally on the laptop. Framework did note there’s a battery-draining bug when using the laptop with either the HDMI or DisplayPort expansion cards installed; that should be fixed in a future software update. But even without those cards installed, I still got the same six or so hours of battery life.</p><figure><img alt="Photos of Framework's first modular and repairable Chromebook." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/944cc6d0-7a2d-11ed-aee3-150a2fd3404b" style="height: 1600; width: 2400;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>After my time with this Chromebook, I”m officially a fan of what Framework is doing. The laptop has few compromises compared to most other ChromeOS devices, namely battery life and a rather pedestrian appearance. But don’t mistake the lack of flash for poor design. The Framework Chromebook is extremely repairable for ordinary humans while still keeping a relatively small and light frame. And it also has a great screen and keyboard to go along with its powerful, upgradeable internals.</p><p>At $999, it’s one of the more expensive Chromebooks on the market, and you could get a comparable device like the Asus Chromebook Spin 714 for the comparatively low cost of $729. But, that device isn’t repairable or upgradeable at all, while the Framework Chromebook can easily be fixed by most people who buy one – and owners can also add more storage, RAM and hopefully even replace the processor down the line to keep it alive for a lot longer than your average laptop. For some people, especially those who feel like our gadgets shouldn’t be disposable things we replace every few years, that makes the Framework Chromebook worth the premium.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/discord/"><ins>Discord</ins></a> is expanding on Connections, a feature that allows users to show what <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-01-spotify-discord-partnership.html"><ins>music they're listening to</ins></a> (among other things), by <a href="http://discord.com/blog/connections">providing a way</a> for folks to verify their identity using accounts on other platforms. Starting in the next few weeks, admins will be able to offer dedicated server roles to users who have authenticated profiles with accounts elsewhere.</p><p>The core idea behind these Linked Roles is to provide a stronger sense of trust. The platforms that support this feature at the outset are Xbox, PlayStation, Steam, Epic Games, Battle.net, League of Legends, Riot Games, Reddit, TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, Twitch, Instagram, Spotify, Facebook, GitHub, Crunchyroll, PayPal and eBay. Discord bots for <em>Destiny 2 </em>(Charlemagne) and <em>Roblox </em>(Bloxlink) support Linked Roles too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="A Discord profile for a user named &#x00201c;Phibi.&#x00201d; They have PayPal, eBay, Steam, and Twitter accounts displayed on their profile.

Discord admins and moderators can also choose to offer server roles with perks, such as access to certain channels, to users who authenticate their accounts with Connections and meet various conditions.</p><p>Admins will be able to select the parameters for unlocking Linked Roles. They can stipulate, for instance, that a user needs to link to a Steam account that's a certain number of days old and/or has a minimum number of <em>Dota 2 </em>or <em>Team Fortress 2 </em>items to show that they're genuine players.

Admins and moderators won't automatically gain access to info from your Connections even if you've already linked accounts before joining a server. You'll need to manually opt-in to a server's Linked Roles before details from your connected accounts are accessible. Moreover, if you're eligible, you can snag a Linked Role on a server without having to show any details from your Connections on your profiles. Discord can handle things on the back end without admins or moderators being able to see your info.</p><p>Linked Roles build on previous Connections features, such as being able to show off whatever <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-november-update-discord-twitch-181425153.html"><ins>Xbox</ins></a> or PlayStation game <a href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-ps4-ps5-integration-playstation-205352162.html"><ins>you're playing</ins></a> on your Discord profile.

Cross-platform authentication can help to verify a person's identity.

## The first Matter smart home devices are here

<p>It took a couple of months, but the first smart home devices to support the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/matter-smart-home-standard-released-160059101.html">Matter standard</a> are finally ready. As <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en/news/eve-welcomes-matter-with-free-firmware-updates-for-three-eve-products">promised</a> in November, Eve Systems is updating the Eve Energy plug and two sensors, the Eve Door &amp; Window and Eve Motion, with Matter support. The free firmware lets the previously HomeKit-only hardware talk to any controller that supports the new technology, including Samsung's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-announces-expanded-partnership-with-google-to-support-matter-devices-184722551.html">SmartThings app</a> as well as upcoming support through <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-device-matter-support-compatibility-141558771.html">Amazon Alexa</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-home-app-smart-home-nest-cameras-130044455.html">Google Home</a>.</p><p>As <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/12/23505097/matter-eve-firmware-update-available-now">notes</a>, the update currently requires the not-yet-official iOS and iPadOS 16.2 upgrades that could arrive this week, and you'll have to enlist in an <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en-us/meet-matter">early access program</a>. You won't need Apple products for much longer, though. Matter-capable products should arrive in the first quarter of 2023 alongside an Android version of Eve's app. The entire roster of 14 Eve devices should support Matter &quot;over time,&quot; according to the company. You'll only have simple functionality on other control platforms at first, but the Android app should expand support.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Matter is a bid to end the compatibility headaches that still plague the smart home world, where you may need certain apps or smart speakers to use your preferred gear. Ideally, you won't have to worry about whether or not a bulb or thermostat will fit into your existing setup — so long as you see the Matter badging, it should work.</p><p>The catch, of course, is that more vendors will need to follow suit. While Matter-ready apps, hubs and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-wifi-pro-faster-speeds-high-gloss-design-130035266.html">network routers</a> are coming relatively quickly, the end devices aren't expected to arrive in force until 2023. Major smart home brands like Signify (Philips Hue) have already pledged support, though, so it's more a question of time than desire.</p>

The QuietComfort 45 can still connect to multiple devices at once, though, and unlike the XM5, its design can fold up for easier storage. It also uses physical control buttons. For $120 less than Sony's pair, it's a good value.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>

## A nano-thin layer of gold could prevent fogged-up glasses

<p>It can be more than a little frustrating when your glasses fog up — just ask anyone who has worn a face mask over the past two years of the pandemic. Nanotechnology might soon keep your vision clear, however. ETH Zurich researchers have <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6c965be-a8ea-473d-89f4-9754f2675a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nature+Research&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNmM5NjViZS1hOGVhLTQ3M2QtODlmNC05NzU0ZjI2NzVhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0dXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zNDE1NjUtMDIyLTAxMjY3LTEiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjEzYmFlNmMyLTU5ZWMtNDcxNy1hODkwLTYwMzFjZGVlMGQ2MyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWPXf1a5GIGI-Jk9Fc-WvmHa8kM9DB-J2y2zCE44L6bH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41565-022-01267-1">developed</a> a gold nanocoating that heats glass by up to 46F by absorbing a large amount of infrared radiation, keeping your glasses fog-free in many humid conditions. And unlike conventional approaches, which merely spread water around using hydrophilic molecules, this prevents the condensation from even starting.</p><p>The 10nm thick coating sandwiches gold between layers of titanium oxide that not only amplify the heating effect through refraction, but protect the gold against wear. The design also won't lead to overheating in warm weather as it prevents radiation from reaching the other side. ETH is keen to point out that it made the coating using techniques common to manufacturing, such as vacuum-based vapor deposition in a clean room. Companies might not have to revamp their production lines, in other words.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Before you ask: it's not as expensive as you think. While gold is a pricey material, the amount needed is so small (it's about 12 times thinner than a typical gold leaf) that it shouldn't add much to the price of your glasses. Nonetheless, the team plans to study the use of other metals.</p><p>You may still have to wait a while before finding gold-coated glasses at your local store. Although the discoverers have applied for a patent, there aren't companies lined up to adopt the invention. It might not be limited to eyewear, thankfully. The research group sees the layer as useful for reducing fog on car windshields, and future implementations could be useful for mirrors, windows and many other transparent surfaces that need to stay warm.</p>

## What we bought: The NuPhy Air75 is the low-profile, Mac-friendly mechanical keyboard I’ve been looking for

<p>For as long as I can remember, my primary keyboard has been the standard wireless model from Apple. I even upgraded to the Magic keyboard when it was introduced in 2015. After all, I thought, it works with my MacBook Pro, I type relatively well on it, and that’s what I need from a keyboard.</p><p>Yet, I harbored a secret lust for mechanical keyboards. There’s a part of me that misses the tactile feel of the chunky keyboards of my youth, especially as someone who spends so much time typing like I do. Plus, since I’m working from home full-time now, I no longer have to worry about annoying cubicle neighbors with the sound of my typing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So, a few months ago, I decided on a whim to look into the whole mechanical keyboard thing a little more. It took me weeks of research, but I finally found one that seems to fit all my needs: the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BaXI3NS1NZWNoYW5pY2FsLUNvbm5lY3Rpb24tQ29tcGF0aWJsZS1TeXN0ZW1zLUdhdGVyb24vZHAvQjA5S0c2TVNWSD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1iZC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGQxN2MxOTUtNDY3MC00YmMxLTk1MTYtNzVjOTk0YjI4NmU5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAeZZt7X4QChE2tfZUE57r5R389KzXlKVCauDKsLSrc1L&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAir75-Mechanical-Connection-Compatible-Systems-Gateron%2Fdp%2FB09KG6MSVH">NuPhy Air75</a>. As it turns out, I fell down a rabbit hole when researching this space. I ended up reading lots of reviews, watching dozens of YouTube videos and diving deep into the product category. I learned about different kinds of keyboards (full-size, tenkeyless, 75 percent, 65 percent), various switches (linear, tactile, clicky), keycaps and so much more. To be honest, I was a little intimidated by it all, but after all this research, I was sold. That luscious sound of clicky keys finally got me to consider getting one.</p><figure><img alt="NuPhy Air75" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/8717fa90-74bd-11ed-bdfc-c2eb336346b2" /><figcaption>NuPhy Air75</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>My research helped me set a few important criteria for the keyboard I wanted. First and foremost, I wanted one with a Mac-specific layout. I know that most keyboards will work with both Macs and PCs, but not all have Mac layouts and I really just prefer the keys to match the OS that I’m using. Next, it needs to be wireless — I don’t like cords and cables messing up my desk. I also wanted the keyboard to support multiple devices so that I could easily switch it between my work and personal laptops. Additionally, I prefer hot-swappable switches and keycaps so that I could have the freedom to swap them out if I wanted. Last but not least, I wanted a relatively low-profile keyboard, as I didn’t want to use a wrist rest.</p><p>That’s how I settled on the NuPhy Air75. It’s Mac friendly, low-profile, has hot-swappable switches and it’s wireless, with the ability to connect up to four devices – three via Bluetooth and one via a 2.4GHz receiver. I also really like the 75-percent size, as the layout is similar to what I’m already used to with the Apple keyboards. Importantly, I could also purchase it right away from Amazon instead of having to wait for a group order, which is a common practice in the mechanical keyboard market. As for the switches, I chose the Gateron Brown tactile ones as I’ve read reviews that suggest they’re a good middle ground between the smooth linear Red switches and the clickier Blue switches.</p><p>I’ve now been using the Air75 for months, and I adore it. I’ll admit that it took me a while to get accustomed to it at first. The keys have a relatively short travel distance thanks to how low-profile they are and I made a lot of typos in the beginning. But I soon got used to the layout, and typing on it is now second nature to me. I love the feel of the Brown switches, too.</p><figure><img alt="NuPhy Air75" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/c23186a0-74bd-11ed-afbf-1d87ac536621" /><figcaption>NuPhy Air75</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>I also really like the overall build quality of the Air75. The aluminum frame is solid, and the default PBT (Polybutylene terephthalate) keycaps have a great look and feel as well. I like that the spacebar and Enter keys are yellow and orange respectively. The keyboard has two LED light strips on either side that I find quite attractive, plus they’re functional; you can customize them so that they light up if the keyboard is low on battery, or when the caps lock is engaged. In addition, it’s super easy to connect via Bluetooth, and swapping the keyboard between my two laptops is simple as well (it’s just a matter of pressing the Function key and an assigned number).</p><p>I do have a couple of nitpicks, though. The NuPhy Air75 has a RGB lighting feature, but because the keys are low-profile and not translucent, it’s pretty hard to notice them. I ended up not using it at all because it does drain the keyboard’s battery. Another is that due to the low-profile nature of the keyboard, it’s difficult to find third-party keycaps that will fit in the aluminum frame (there just aren’t that many low-profile keycaps on the market). One of the features of customizable mechanical keyboards like these is that you can easily swap out keycaps to whatever color and design you want, but that’s not so easy here.</p><p>I saw a YouTube video a few months ago that compared the feeling of typing on a mechanical keyboard to that of writing with a fountain pen, and I have to agree. Fountain pens make handwriting such a joy thanks to how fluid and smooth it feels. Similarly, typing on the NuPhy Air75 is a pleasure because of that tactile and satisfying feedback. Now that I’ve tried mechanical keyboards like the NuPhy Air75, I don’t think I can ever go back to the standard Apple models.</p>

## The best soundbars for 2022

<p>It's no secret that the built-in speakers in most TVs are trash. They don't project enough sound out to the front so you can hear well — especially subtle details. Thankfully, you don't have to splurge for a five-speaker (or more)<a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-build-a-budget-home-theater-setup-140010399.html"> surround-sound setup</a> to fix the problem. In most living rooms, a single soundbar and maybe a subwoofer will suffice. To help guide your shopping spree, we've compiled a list of everything to look for when searching for the best soundbar for you, along with a list of the top picks for a range of budgets.</p><h2>What to look for in a soundbar</h2><h3>Features</h3><p>When it comes to features, the more you pay the more you're going to get. Most affordable options ($150 or less) will improve your television's audio, but that's about it. Step into the $300 to $400 range and you'll find things like built-in voice control, wireless connectivity, Chromecast, AirPlay 2 and even Android TV. They're all helpful when you want to avoid looking for the remote, but the best audio quality is usually only in the top tier and the formats those premium devices support. I’m talking about things like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and other high-resolution audio standards. These are what you'll want to look for if truly immersive sound is what you crave for your living room setup. And not all Atmos soundbars are equal, so you'll need to look at the finer details carefully before you break into the savings account.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h3>Ports</h3><figure><img alt="Sony HT-A7000 soundbar, SA-SW5 subwoofer, SA-SW3 subwoofer and SA-RS3S speakers." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cfb15b20-e904-11eb-9f99-c08983de4f5c" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>This is a big one. A lot of the more affordable soundbars have limited options when it comes to connectivity. They either offer an optical port or one HDMI jack and, if you're lucky, both. Things get slightly better in the mid-range section, but that's not always the case. The Sonos Beam, for example, is $449, but only has a single HDMI port. If you want to connect your set-top box, gaming console and more directly to your soundbar for the best possible audio, you'll likely want to look for an option with at least two HDMI (eARC) inputs. HDMI connections are essential for things like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and other high-res and immersive audio formats. And with<a href="https://www.hdmi.org/spec/hdmi2_1"> the HDMI 2.1 spec</a>, soundbars can support HDR, 8K and 4K/120 passthrough to make these speakers an even better companion for a game console.</p><h3>Channels</h3><p>Another big thing you’ll want to pay attention to is channels. That’s the 2.1, 7.1.2 or other decimal number that companies include in product descriptions. The first figure corresponds to the number of channels. A two would just be left and right while a more robust Atmos system, especially one with rear satellite speakers, could be five or seven (left, right, center and upward). The second number refers to the subwoofer, so if your soundbar comes with one or has them built in, you’ll see a one here. The third numeral is up-firing speakers, important for the immersive effect of Dolby Atmos. Not all Atmos-enabled units have them, but if they do, the third number will tell you how many are in play.</p><h3>Wireless</h3><figure><img alt="Sony HT-A7000 soundbar, SA-SW5 subwoofer, SA-SW3 subwoofer and SA-RS3S speakers." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cff960a0-e904-11eb-ad7a-7525dbfffb3a" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>Most soundbars these days offer either Bluetooth, WiFi or both. When it comes to WiFi, that connectivity affords you luxuries like voice control (either built-in or with a separate device), Chromecast, Spotify Connect and AirPlay 2. Depending on your preferences, you might be able to live without some of these. For me, AirPlay 2 and Chromecast are essentials, but the rest I can live without. Those two give me the ability to beam music and podcasts from my go-to apps without having to settle for — or struggle with — a Bluetooth connection.</p><h3>Size</h3><p>This one might seem obvious but humor me for a minute. Nothing is more soul-crushing than getting a pricey soundbar in your living room only to discover you have to rearrange everything to find a spot for it. This was my plight when the<a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TZW5uaGVpc2VyLUFNQkVPLVNvdW5kYmFyLTUtMS00LUNoYW5uZWwvZHAvQjA4Sjk5UjhXSj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1jaS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTBhOTBkN2YtODQ5ZS00NGYwLWJjNGQtODY3MmM4M2QwMDZkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdSXCtH3GZlqKOEeTxYF-ucIgg9x4QArao7UtuglYKcD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSennheiser-AMBEO-Soundbar-5-1-4-Channel%2Fdp%2FB08J99R8WJ%3F"> Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar</a> arrived at my door. Yes, that speaker is absurdly large (and heavy), and most soundbars aren't nearly as big. I learned a valuable lesson: Make sure the space where you want to put a soundbar will accommodate the thing you're about to spend hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars on.</p><p>Basically, it all comes down to the TV you have (or are planning to get) and what the primary goal is for your living-room audio. Is it ease of use? Do you want the best possible sound from a single speaker or speaker/sub combo? Do you just want to be able to actually hear your TV better? Or do you want to turn your living room into an immersive home theater?</p><p>By paying attention to each of those areas, you should have a good idea of what to look for in a soundbar, soundbar/sub combo or a more robust setup. With that said, we've put numerous products through their paces at Engadget and have a few favorites at various price points to get you started.</p><h2>Best premium soundbar: Sony HT-A7000</h2><p></p><p>Sony has a long track record of excellent high-end soundbars and<a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ht-a7000-soundbar-ht-a9-home-theater-system-140038379.html"> its latest</a> is another great-sounding product.

For that reason, the company doesn’t think you’ll need a dedicated sub. Indeed, the Panorama 3 does offer ample bass, but it’s not nearly on the level as a standalone unit. This soundbar does have a low-profile, refined design alongside voice capabilities, “hidden until lit” touch controls and support for aptX Adaptive, AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect. Most importantly, it’s currently available for $200 less than the original MSRP at $799.</p><h2>Best midrange soundbar: Sonos Beam</h2><p></p><p>Solid sound quality? Check. Dolby Atmos? Yep. Compact and easy to set up? Uh huh. Compatible with other Sonos products for a more robust system? You betcha. The first-gen Sonos Beam has been one of our favorites<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-27-sonos-beam-review.html"> since it arrived in 2018</a>, but there was one thing it didn’t have: Dolby Atmos.

Sonos manages to make things seem more directional by tweaking audio timing and frequency instead of adding more drivers.<a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-beam-gen-2-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-130024506.html"> The new Beam</a> still only has the one HDMI port which means you won’t be connecting a gaming console or set-top box directly to this. It also means that if you have an older TV with an optical jack, you’ll need an adapter.</p><h2>Runner-up midrange soundbar: Samsung HW-Q700B</h2><p></p><p>Samsung’s mid-range <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TQU1TVU5HLUhXLVE3MDBCLTMtMS0yY2gtU291bmRiYXItV2lyZWxlc3MvZHAvQjA5WDYxRk40OD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1jaS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTBhOTBkN2YtODQ5ZS00NGYwLWJjNGQtODY3MmM4M2QwMDZkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfji-2qNCAI8DQjuHvNIP5VScZcdqHpPz_jsg8rsgpyW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSAMSUNG-HW-Q700B-3-1-2ch-Soundbar-Wireless%2Fdp%2FB09X61FN48">Q700B</a> will cost you $700, but it comes with a bundled subwoofer. This model also supports wireless Dolby Atmos connectivity with 2022 Samsung smart TVs over WiFi and the 3.1.2-channel configuration includes up-firing speakers for proper immersive sound. The Q700B supports Q-Symphony which allows you to use both the soundbar and your TV speakers for a more robust setup on some 2021 and 2022 Samsung TVs. SpaceFit Sound automatically calibrates the soundbar/sub combo to a room, Adaptive Sound optimizes audio for specific content types and Tap Sound allows you to send tunes from a Samsung phone to the Q700B with a simple tap. HDMI eARC connectivity is here as well, and so is voice control, AirPlay, Chromecast and a gaming-specific audio mode.</p><h2>Another midrange option: Sonos Ray</h2><p></p><p>Sonos’ latest soundbar may be its most affordable to date, but at $279, it’s not exactly a budget pick. Especially when you consider there are cheaper options that come with a subwoofer. Still, the compact design doesn’t command a lot of space in front of your TV, making it a great option for smaller living spaces. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvcmF5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlMGE5MGQ3Zi04NDllLTQ0ZjAtYmM0ZC04NjcyYzgzZDAwNmQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfKSgw-aCz0Rbp-651h22Yv_dlsri1UlZQC5hXkCcVzM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fray">The Ray</a> is easy to set up and provides great sound quality for both TV and music. There are some trade-offs when it comes to the immersive nature of the audio, but it’s a good option for upgrading your TV sound with minimal fuss.</p><h2>Best budget soundbar: Vizio V21t-J8</h2><p></p><p>If you’re looking for a way to improve your TV sound on a budget, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vizio-m-series-quantum-x-tvs-elevate-soundbar-100052598.html">Vizio has some solid options</a>.

This would be a great choice if you don’t want your add-on TV speaker to take up a lot of space. There’s no WiFi connectivity, but that’s really the only sacrifice when it comes to the basics. HDMI ARC/eARC and optical connections link to your television while a 3.5mm aux jack and Bluetooth allow you to play music from your phone or another device. DTS Virtual:X compatibility offers some of the effect of surround sound without a bigger unit or additional speakers.</p><p></p>

## 'Forspoken' hands-on: Fun, but frantic

<p>After multiple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-delays-forspoken-january-24-2023-pc-ps5-180706295.html">delays</a>, Square Enix’s next big game is almost here. <em>Forspoken</em> is the first title to come from the development team that made <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-26-final-fantasy-xv-episode-ardyn-dlc.html"><em>Final Fantasy XV</em></a><em> –</em> a game that came out in 2016<em>. </em>I spent over five hours working my way through several of the early game chapters, exploring the mystical land of Athia as Frey, attached to a sassy British-accented bangle that talks into her brain. Almost immediately they have to fight off mutated monsters and zombies and figure out how to get back home – probably saving this world on the way.</p><p>While we know the magical attacks in <em>Forspoken</em> are spectacular, my one-on-one battle with Sila, the Tanta of Strength, made the biggest impression during my preview session – and the best showcase for all the attacks and moves you’ll be able to master.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="921c49b94fe34a509146bd70f9d29a69"></div><p>What are the Tantas? They are a handful of sorceresses that rule the medieval, but shattered, land of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ps5-project-athia-luminous-productions-preview-203354543.html">Athia</a>. Yes, be prepared for a barrage of lore and encyclopedic entries on the history, flora and fauna of Athia – but at least I could look up everything in the menu if I ever got lost. The protagonist Frey comes with emotional baggage, some misdemeanors and a mysterious origin story of being abandoned at a train station – something that I’m sure will be revisited later in the game. She’s just as new to this world as you, but she still loves dropping the f-bomb and assorted swear words at every opportunity. I’m not a prude, it just feels excessive and immature. Hopefully, this angst tempers as the game progresses.</p><p>The world of <em>Forspoken</em> is a mixture of natural beauty, paranormal detritus and towns, buildings and structures from when the world hadn’t been turned upside down by what Frey calls the Break. And you can see why: It’s a huge, broken world, with glowing crystal formations jutting out of cliffs and hills. Animals and people have been transformed into fearsome beasts and zombies. Your first interaction with the locals (after hiding from a dragon), is some sort of dog-bear... thing with teeth from top to bottom. This confrontation leads to you discovering some magical gifts from Cuff – a mysterious bangle that tags along for your adventure (and is almost <em>definitely</em> critical to the story).</p><p>There’s a connection between the aforementioned Tanta, a war, and whatever went wrong with, you know, with the entire world. And probably a good reason why a portal opened to our Earth when Frey got her hands on that magical bangle.</p><p>Cuff isn’t only around for the (often shoehorned) narrative exposition. It offers a degree of defense (your health bar comes from the bangle, not Frey herself), but also imbues the character with an array of plant- and earth-based magical spells. These translate to support (plant) and attack (earth).</p><p>I enjoyed mixing them up. Attack spells are the showstoppers: cinematic elemental attacks that are usually ranged. There’s a skill tree to unlock upgraded spells, as well as more attack options. Some of the earth spells can deal consistent damage, like magical machine guns, while others will deal charged-up burst damage, or even create an earthen shield that will counter some physical attacks. Each one seems to have a use case.</p><p>When you’re facing a particularly tough foe, effective use of your spells will build up a special surge magic meter. Once that’s full, you can unleash a devastating attack that can hit (and hopefully kill) multiple enemies.</p><figure><img alt="Forspoken preview" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/2a08a410-7703-11ed-97f7-a7a1aa0d0933" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><p>While some support skills are set-and-forget, like a flower ‘turret’, others require a bit more strategy. You can hit an enemy with a slow-burn seed attack to gradually seep their strength, which is useful on slower, high-defense enemies. A leech attack will lash out in a wide arc, returning health depending on how much damage it does. If you use it against multiple enemies, you’ll get more in return. These all come with a cooldown compared to the attack skills, so you’ll have to use them all strategically. (My timing and skill definitely improved as I played the game.)</p><p><em>Forspoken</em> will even grade your battles, like <em>Devil May Cry </em>or<em> Bayonetta</em>. At the start of my preview demo, with limited skill (and options) I struggled to get beyond C-rank fights but in moments near the end of my demo, I’d somehow claim ‘star’ rankings – the top grade. These ranks take into account how long fights took, the amount of damage taken, damage dished out and the creative range of attacks used. You’ll get bonus points for a surprise attack, among other things. If I just gunned enemies down from afar, it was not going to get a good grade. Skilled play is rewarded by bigger loot payouts and even an experience point boost, making leveling up (and upgrading) even quicker.</p><p>As you might expect from an action RPG, there are all kinds of ways to strengthen Frey. Beyond leveling up and expanding the spell repertoire, there are equipment slots for both a necklace accessory and cloak. These can both be upgraded once you find the right resources and also customized with boons to improve health, defense and attack. I was able to even automate healing with one accessory I found during my playthrough. I could also customize Frey’s nails to beef up certain spell families, helping magic to recharge faster or simply deal more damage.</p><p>Around the same time as Frey learns she can hurl boulders and summon vines, she’s also gifted with magical parkour skills, which are a mix of parkour, wall climbing and ice skating. This really helps get across the vast landscape at a fair clip – it’s like having a horse without, well, having a horse. <em>Forspoken</em> tries to make the most of the PS5’s DualSense, too – Sony has a two-year exclusive with Luminous Productions’ first game. As I magically skated and jumped around, the controller subtly vibrated; when Cuff had a quip about my battle skill (or lack of), they spoke out of the DualSense speaker. The most satisfying part was the force feedback on the triggers as I charged up spells, especially if they were the big, explosive ones.</p><p>These traversal skills are sewn into the fights, too. While dodging can be a little too forgiving – Frey will sometimes arc and leap off air to avoid attacks ad infinitum– combining magical dodges and dashes with earth spells and vine attacks will amp up the power of some of Frey’s moves. Timing, however, is crucial.</p><p>The battle system did throw up some difficulty spikes. At one point, before facing off with the aforementioned sorceress Sila, I found myself being repeatedly humbled (and killed) by a herd of demon goats. Was I under-leveled? Possibly. Did I lack accessories and equipment upgrades? Definitely. But it was a choke point where the fights seemed suddenly harder than everything that came before it (including a few boss fights). In fact, it was harder for me than the eventual showdown with the Tanta of Strength, Sila.</p><p>The lock-on system seemed a little temperamental (often an issue when it’s assigned to the L3 or R3 stick buttons), and while many attacks can affect multiple enemies at once, the system leans toward one-on-one fighting – otherwise a lot of target-switching. This was still an early build of the game, however. There’s time for this to be finessed – something that’s also true of a few graphical glitches, like invisible spell effects and missing objects during a few cutscenes.</p><section><img alt="Forspoken preview" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/29862da0-7703-11ed-b6be-bb8cef45dead" /></section><p>While groups were often an issue, the controls come together well in the bigger battles. Once I’d made it to the throne of the fire, sword and fiery sword-wielding Sila, I had to swap around my spells and keep my distance. Sila could soak up plenty of damage and was incredibly lethal up close. Once Frey was able to whittle down her health enough, she was joined by a platoon of her soldiers (ugh, a group battle) and went through another two ‘levels’ of fury. Without giving everything away, eventually, Frey’s left in a fiery battleground, trying to dodge molten floors and sword attacks while flinging her own earth spells and trying to restrain the raging boss with vine sorcery. It felt like the right balance of skill and cinematic magical warfare – and fun. Sila comes across as an off-kilter monster, making it easy to want to beat her.</p><p>Eventually, I prevailed and received the fire-based spells of Sila for myself, creating an entirely new skill tree of spells and charms centered around strength (buffs) and, of course, fire. If Frey is going to pick up several more skill trees from the other three Tantas, knowingly referenced in wall paintings ahead of that confrontation, that’s going to mean a lot of spells and a lot of upgrades. While I didn’t get a chance to mix up my new fire spells with earth at this demo, I wonder if there might be <em>too</em> many. There’s a reason Square Enix has uploaded extensive videos on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-forspoken-magical-parkour-spells-rpg-140017421.html%20https://www.engadget.com/..."><em>Forspoken’s </em>magic system</a>, even if it whets the appetite with huge lightning strikes and giant explosive orbs of water. But how will all these tricks interplay? Do we really need so many spells? We’ll have to wait to see — and you can now test out a few of Frey's tricks yourself in the free demo, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-forspoken-demo-ps5t-130053708.html">available now. </a></p><p><em>Forspoken</em> launches January 24th 2023 on PC and PS5.</p><p></p>

## Rivian pauses Mercedes-Benz electric van partnership after just 3 months

<p>Just three months after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-mercedes-benz-electric-van-partnership-142406287.html">announcing</a> a partnership with Mercedes to manufacture commercial electric vans in Europe, Rivian now says its pausing those plans to concentrate on its own business. &quot;At this point in time, we believe focusing on our consumer business, as well as our existing commercial business, represent the most attractive near-term opportunities to maximize value for Rivian,&quot; it said in a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221212005259/en/Rivian-Pauses-Partnership-Discussions-With-Mercedes-Benz-on-Electric-Van-Production-in-Europe">press release</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The company said it will &quot;no longer pursue the memorandum of understanding with Mercedes-Benz,&quot; but the parting appears to be amicable and potentially not permanent. &quot;Exploring strategic opportunities with the team at Rivian in the future remains an option, as we share the same strategic ambition: accelerating the EV adoption with benchmark products for our customers,&quot; Mercedes-Benz's head of vans Mathias Geisen said in a statement. It added that Rivian's decision wouldn't change its commercial electrification strategy.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Rivian has seen some setbacks in the past year. Despite being one of the best of funded EV startups, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-lays-off-6-percent-of-its-workforce-as-it-struggles-with-production-082137076.html">announced</a> last summer that it would lay off six percent of its workforce in an effort to cut costs. Earlier, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-hikes-the-price-of-its-quad-motor-pickup-by-12000-065521100.html">revealed</a> that it would hike prices on vehicles already on pre-order, before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-reverses-r1t-r1s-pre-orders-164952720.html">backing off</a> and applying the increases only to future orders. On the plus side, its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1s-suv-ev-review-video-160029394.html">R1S SUV</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-review-150019762.html">R1T pickup</a> EVs have generally received good reviews.</p><p>Other EV startups have also run into problems this year due to inflation, higher interest rates and other issues. Arrival, for one, was forced to put its electric bus and car projects on hold due to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arrival-ices-bus-car-ev-projects-cash-093534294.html">struggles with cash</a>. And Faraday Future <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-lays-off-6-percent-of-its-workforce-as-it-struggles-with-production-082137076.html">delayed the launch</a> of its first EV, the FF91, also over cash flow issues.&nbsp;</p>

## Xiaomi's 13 Pro is an early look at 2023's flagship phones

<p>Xiaomi's 13 series flagship smartphones are here, and as usual, they're loaded with the <a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/iqoo-11-series-082540199.html">latest technology and features</a>. With the 13 and 13 Pro, Xiaomi is the second manufacturer to use Qualcomm's latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomms-snapdragon-8-gen-2-chip-offers-hardware-accelerated-ray-tracing-230008445.html">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 </a>platform, following Vivo with the X90 Pro and <a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/iqoo-11-series-082540199.html">IQOO 11 series</a>. They also have new camera modules with improved image quality, ultra-fast charging and more.&nbsp;</p><p>As with the <a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/xiaomi-12s-ultra-leica-one-inch-sensor-132950457.html">previous models</a>, the Xiaomi 13 and 13 Pro have separate designs. The 13 Pro uses a wrap-around 6.73-inch 2K+ AMOLED screen (3,200 x 1,400) with vegan leather or ceramic back versions. Meanwhile, the 13 has a flat 6.36-inch 2,400 x 1,080 AMOLED display, iPhone-like aluminum sides and either glass or leather back options. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile platform offers hardware accelerated ray-tracing and improved gaming performance, so both phones have 120Hz displays to keep up.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Xiaomi's 13 Pro packs a 1-inch camera sensor and Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/b98d1e70-7a02-11ed-9dbf-865b9a7b39b0" style="height: 946; width: 2200;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>The Xiaomi 13 Pro has top-flight camera specs, too. It packs a 50-megapixel (MP) f/1.9 main camera with a Type 1-inch sensor (like other Type 1-inch sensors it's really only 8.8 x 13.2mm, but still significantly larger than on most smartphones). It also includes a 50MP 3.2 zoom camera (75mm equivalent) with optical image stabilization (OIS) and a floating lens, as pictured above. Finally, it has a 50MP f/2.2 ultra-wide camera (14mm equivalent), and 32MP punch-hole selfie cam.&nbsp;</p><p>The Xiaomi 13 (below), meanwhile, has the same selfie camera, a 50MP f/1.8 OIS main camera with a smaller sensor, a 10MP 3.2x zoom OIS zoom camera and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide (15mm equivalent) camera.</p><figure><img alt="Xiaomi's 13 Pro packs a 1-inch camera sensor and Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/d4675b20-7a02-11ed-bddd-88f0d5439099" style="height: 1058; width: 1643;" /><figcaption>Xiaomi 13</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>The 13 Pro offers impressive 120W charging (more than many laptops), bringing the 4,820mAh battery from zero to a 100 percent charge in just 19 minutes. That's fast, but still significantly slower than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/redmi-note-12-discovery-edition-210w-hypercharge-064020788.html">Redmi's Note 12 Discovery Edition</a>. Wireless charging happens at &quot;just&quot; 50 watts, or 36 minutes to a full charge. The Xiaomi 13, has a slightly smaller 4,500 mAh battery and is limited to 67W wired charging (38 minutes to 100 percent) and 50W wireless charging (48 minutes to a full charge).&nbsp;</p><p>Other features include LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 storage on both models (8GB and 128GB up to 12GB and 512GB on both models), Dolby Atmos on the Pro model and Leica camera tech. For the latter, Xiaomi and Leica built a color model based on 4,700 scenes, presumably allowing for improved accuracy. Prices start at 4,999 yuan ($720) for the Xiaomi 13 Pro and 3,999 yuan ($570) for the Xiaomi 13. Those are seriously good prices for such high spec phones, but as usual, you likely won't be able to buy them in North America.&nbsp;</p>
