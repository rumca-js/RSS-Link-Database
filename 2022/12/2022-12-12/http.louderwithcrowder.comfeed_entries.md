Rest assured... there <em>IS</em> still a crisis along our southern border. Critics will say it is a crisis of Joe Biden's creation, what with the crisis starting as soon as Biden assumed office and pushed the policies that led to the crisis. The White House would prefer ignoring the crisis while <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-melugin-wh-complains" target="_self">lashing out</a> at anyone who <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-melugin-wh-complains" target="_self">reports on the crisis</a>. The key word here? Crisis. Crisisity Chrisisy Chrisis.</p><p>While other reporters are busy finding new ways to ignore or dismiss what Twitter employees were up to behind the scenes, Bill Melugin is focused like a laser on our southern border. And in El Paso, a huge migrant caravan of over a thousand people crossed illegally. It's the largest single group Melguin's teams has ever seen.

## Watch: Russian media is LAUGHING at America after lopsided Brittney Griner trade

Brittney Griner was released from a Russian prison last week after Joe Biden traded a notorious arms dealer for her. We got Brittney and the Russians got Viktor "the Merchant of Death" Bout in the most lopsided trade since the Tennessee Titans traded A.J. Brown for some draft picks. Oh, and Paul Whelan, the Marine who has been imprisoned in Russia for four years? He's still there.</p><p>If you need any other evidence of what a horrible trade this is, here is Russian media laughing at us. RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan was especially blunt.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">🇷🇺 🇺🇸 The US traded the Merchant of Death for Brittney Griner and not Paul Whelan because he has three major problems, according to Russia 1: <br /><br />1 He is White <br /><br />2 He is a Man<br /><br />3 He is Heterosexual <a href="https://t.co/WQVAijdunT">pic.twitter.com/WQVAijdunT</a><br />— 𝕽𝖔𝖓𝖎𝖓 🔞 (@oldirtyronin) <a href="https://twitter.com/oldirtyronin/status/1601578167302782976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>[Whalen] is a hero, a decorated Marine covered in medals.

## Woke School Board Member: This 'cis white male' would make a great president if he wasn't such a cis white male

The board was about to elect a cis white male to be president. Gregory D’Elia with his cis'y white maleness came close to assuming a position of power as so many cis white males before him. But board member Jennifer Solot stood strong! And while she agreed D'Elia would make a great president, a cis white male?</p><p>Eww! Gross! Barf!</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">🚨 <a href="https://twitter.com/UpperMorelandSD?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@UpperMorelandSD</a> Board member, Jennifer Solot, says she is against electing the only, “cis white male on this board,” as president of the district because it, “sends the wrong message to our community.”<br /><br />Wow. Saying the quiet part out loud. <a href="https://t.co/stEMoeUExS">pic.twitter.com/stEMoeUExS</a><br />— Megan Brock (@MegEBrock) <a href="https://twitter.com/MegEBrock/status/1601605409382756352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>I believe that Mr. D’Elia would make an excellent president. However, I feel that electing the only cis, white male president of this district sends the wrong message to our community — a message that is contrary to what we as a board have been trying to accomplish.</blockquote><p>Solot then added she believes it important for the board to practice what they preach and that their words "have strength when they are spoken."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="00a2a" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32327720&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>As if D’Elia wasn't emasculated enough, he then had to sit there as he was the only vote for himself. </p><p>You get <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-prank-names" target="_blank">the school board</a> you tolerate. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/south-carolina-school-board" target="_blank">In some districts</a>, parents stand up and vote people pushing Marxist politics in schools out of office. In this Philadelphia suburb, parents have decided it's important their children learn to be judged by the color of their skin (or the angle of their dangle) and not by the content of their character.</p><p>I know my peers are outraged at this video, and I totally get why. But D’Elia sat there and took it, and the parents of the district don't seem to care. Or, they're just as racist as the other school board members and believe race and gender should be factors considered for employment. Either way, we just had an election. You get what you vote for. It's Upper Moreland's problem.</p><p><p>

At last night's Boston Bruins vs Arizona Coyotes game, they stopped fighting on the ice to watch it going down on sight in the stands. </p><p>No one is sure what led to what turned into a co-ed brawl. My guess? Alcohol. Lots and lots of alcohol.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Insane crowd fight at the Coyotes-Bruins game last night. Excellent work from the cop in the foreground! <a href="https://t.co/BQhFXtHG9g">pic.twitter.com/BQhFXtHG9g</a><br />— Pete Blackburn (@PeteBlackburn) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeteBlackburn/status/1601613785596571648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>If 2022 has taught us anything, it's that society is unraveling so much <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mcdonalds-employee-fight" target="_blank">even the ladies</a> are <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/melbourne-cup-2022-walkway-fight" target="_blank">starting to pop off on each other</a> with more frequency. In the olden days, they would let the menfolk handle the fight and then claim how embarrassed they were on the ride home. Last night, one lady tried to break the fight up. And learned the hard way about attempting to break fights up.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="04483" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32327522&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Though she took it like a champ. You can't hear it on the video, but I'd bet money she told the guy "you hit like a b*tch."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="780a1" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32327525&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>The highlight is the red-shirt dude going off the top like he's Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka. Though now that I rewatch the video, it looked like he may have been thrown. That's more of a Midnight Express "Rocket Launcher." Either way, when one dude does a high-cross body to take out a bunch of other dudes, that's never a good sign.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="f50fb" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32327528&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>In the end, the fight was broken up. I'm guessing the two dudes were removed from the premises, if not given five for fighting and thrown into the drunk tank. The only thing missing was one of the guys pulling the other guy's shirt over his head and landed some uppercuts to the body. It's a hockey game. Act like you've been there before.</p><p><p>

The reaction is exactly what you would expect it to be. That includes neither the comedian nor the chief twit giving a f*ck.</p><p>Let's go right to the videos. Or, in theory, let's go to the videos. Allegedly, according to people on Twitter, the videos are being removed. If that's the case when you are reading this, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11528559/Elon-Musk-met-chorus-boos-brought-stage-Dave-Chappelle-gig.html" target="_blank">Daily Mail has a clip</a> while I find something else for me to embed. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">lmao elon musk getting booed off stage at the dave chappelle show in san francisco <a href="https://t.co/5AlwUAbeNp">pic.twitter.com/5AlwUAbeNp</a><br />— 🧝🏻♂️ (@clownevomit) <a href="https://twitter.com/clownevomit/status/1602271586773762048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>It sounds like some of the people you fired are in the audience... All of those people who are booing, I'm just pointing out the obvious, they have terrible seats.

Well, it was San Francisco and Musk is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-san-francisco-mayor" target="_blank">fighting to clean the city up</a>. Musk and Chappelle have a number of the same enemies right now. Both are free-speech absolutists. But above all, it's because <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-snl" target="_blank">he's Dave Chappelle</a> and Dave Chappelle can do whatever Dave Chappelle things he wants.</p><p>As for the boos, Elon Musk had the perfect response: "I'm rich, b*tch!"</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Elon Musk has just three words for people booing him at Dave Chappelle’s show… <a href="https://t.co/7yLmvDmxrZ">pic.twitter.com/7yLmvDmxrZ</a><br />— Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1602292595044106242?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>It's Monday morning and two of the left's most hated shared a stage together.

## 'Neither good nor kind': Elon Musk launches woke astronaut into orbit over Fauci, truth about pronouns

A dig towards the media's favorite government bureaucrat and a man who is literally "the science," Anthony Fauci. We here <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-fauci" target="_blank">at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website</a> wondered if the sudden digs at Anthony Fauci are a preview of what's to come.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Oh it is coming bigtime …<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1601886758987104256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Say it with me now...</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>The Fauci Files are about to come, no doubt all over Twitter.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Before they do, there is the matter of Elon making a joke about his preferred pronouns. Leftists were big mad over it. One person, former astronaut Scott Kelly, lashed out at the Chief Twit. Kelly, without evidence, accused Musk of promoting "hate" toward the "marginalized."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">.<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@elonmusk</a> Elon, please don’t mock and promote hate toward already marginalized and at-risk-of-violence members of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LGBTQ?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LGBTQ</a>+ community. They are real people with real feelings. Furthermore, Dr Fauci is a dedicated public servant whose sole motivation was saving lives. <a href="https://t.co/Vgu04XMGeZ">https://t.co/Vgu04XMGeZ</a><br />— Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) <a href="https://twitter.com/StationCDRKelly/status/1602099380625887233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>After all, people <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/frog-pronouns" target="_blank">who have preferred pronouns</a> are serious people who need to be taken seriously at all times.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Frog/frogself pronouns <a href="https://t.co/YudloJJxSP">pic.twitter.com/YudloJJxSP</a><br />— Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) <a href="https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1566474143939366913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Elon disagreed with Kelly on both pronouns AND Tony "The Science" Fauci. The irony of his Twitter response is that it would have gotten him suspended on Twitter if he tweeted it before buying Twitter: <em>"Forcing your pronouns upon others when they didn’t ask, and implicitly ostracizing those who don’t, is neither good nor kind to anyone."</em></p><p>As for 'The Science": <em>"He lied to Congress and funded gain-of-function research that killed millions of people. Not awesome IMO."</em></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I strongly disagree. Forcing your pronouns upon others when they didn’t ask, and implicitly ostracizing those who don’t, is neither good nor kind to anyone.<br /><br />As for Fauci, he lied to Congress and funded gain-of-function research that killed millions of people. Not awesome imo.<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1602113254360162304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Definitely not awesome.</p><p>It's important for conservatives to remember that while we like the cut of Elon's jib this week, that wasn't always the case. Whether or not he's had a change of perspective or is saying things to fire up Twitter because he knows how predictable the left -- and the right -- is... what do I know? I'm only here for the content.</p><p>But the Twitter Files haven't disappointed as of yet. As the files get into the past year and a half of Twitter suspending and/or visibility filtering -- remember, "shadowbanning" is a conspiracy -- anyone who contradicted the admin's "The Science" narrative, Tony melting down is going to be glorious. As we've seen with Rand Paul, Fauci doesn't handle the slightest bit of criticism well.</p><p><p>
