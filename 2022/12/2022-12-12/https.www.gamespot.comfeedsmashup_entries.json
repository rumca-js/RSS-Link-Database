Badalamenti eventually became Lynch's go-to composer, creating music for Twin Peaks, Lost Highway, and Mulholland Drive. In 1990, Badalamenti won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance for his work on Twin Peaks.

"date_published": "2022-12-12 20:55:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Loot. Few words in gaming hold such power. The promise of sick loot is a siren song that has driven many a player to take on bold challenges and reconsider their objectives\u2026 as well as to make exceptionally poor judgments and even pry open their real-life wallets. Many games, regardless of era and platform, are fundamentally about the satisfaction of obtaining loot, but few will admit that. Dragon Quest Treasures is the rare game that states outright that accumulating a trove of legendary loot is the whole point--and, if you can endure some of its gameplay and technical foibles, you too can experience the satisfaction of having a Scrooge McDuck-like vault of gold (but not the experience of swimming in it).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Dragon Quest Treasures tells the tale of young Erik and Mia, who were first introduced in Dragon Quest XI. Dissatisfied after having been adopted by the pillaging, hard-partying Vikings, the duo decide to escape from the ship and go out on their own to become great treasure hunters. Along the way they free a duo of odd winged critters and stumble upon the Dragon Daggers, enchanted weapons that whisk them away to the realm of Draconia, where treasure hunting is a way of life. Somewhere on these floating islands lie the legendary Dragonstone artifacts, and Erik and Mia are going to get them all--along with an absurd amount of mythical relics just waiting to be dug up.</p><figure style=\"width: 1280px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4075426-en_dqtr_20221205wj_20.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\"

turn-based and menu-driven, Dragon Quest Treasures is an action-RPG. Playing as either Erik or Mia (who are functionally identical), you explore one of several large open-world islands, defeating enemies, completing quests, gathering materials, and--most importantly--discovering those sweet, shiny silver and gold treasure chests. The more treasure they find, the more notoriety they get--and the more their base, initially a decrepit magical railroad station, becomes remodeled into a fabulously gaudy headquarters. This also opens up more gameplay elements, as well as revealing hints about the location of the elusive Dragonstones. While you can explore the game freely at your own pace, some parts are progress-locked based on how much loot you've accumulated.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-quest-treasures-review-all-about-that-bling/1900-6418012/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fanatical-winter-sale-is-live-with-thousands-of-pc-game-deals/2900-4526/", "title": "Fanatical Winter Sale Is Live With Thousands Of PC Game Deals", "date_published": "2022-12-12 20:39:00+00:00", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4075317-eldenring%2818%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-9020176-15339241-1663065986000?sid=subid_value\">Fanatical</a> </span> is running a gigantic Winter Sale through the rest of December, giving you a chance to score thousands of games at some of their lowest prices of the season.

In addition, the drop rate for Legendary and Set items will be increased by 250% for those players who are well below the server Paragon level, with the drop rate decreasing as players reach higher Paragon levels.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-terrors-tide-update-continues-the-games-main-story/1100-6509964/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fire-emblem-engage-divine-edition-preorders-discounted-at-walmart/1100-6507443/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Fire Emblem Engage Divine Edition Preorders Discounted At Walmart", "date_published": "2022-12-12 19:35:00+00:00", "description": "<p><strong>Update: </strong>Walmart is currently selling the <span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/159047/565706/9383?&amp;sharedId=gamespot&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Fire-Emblem-Engage-Divine-Edition/718778589&amp;subId1=subid_value\">Fire Emblem Engage Divine Edition for only $82.</a> </span> This edition retails for $100, so we expect this deal to sell out quickly (December 12).</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/159047/565706/9383?&amp;sharedId=gamespot&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Fire-Emblem-Engage-Divine-Edition/718778589&amp;subId1=subid_value\">See at Walmart</a> </div></div><p> </p><p>Fire Emblem Engage is a brand-new entry in the long-running strategy franchise, first revealed during <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-september-2022-the-biggest-games-and-announcements/2900-4327/\">September\u2019s Nintendo Direct</a>.

Strange World was released alongside Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery and Devotion, as well as the wide expansions of The Fabelmans and cannibal romance Bones and All. The film was initially projected to gross $30 to 40 million but managed $4.2.

One of the kids has allegedly notched over 7,781 hours of the game in less than two years, which is almost a full calendar year worth of play.

Let us know which ones you've already played, as well as any games on the list you're still itching to try out before the first wave of new games arrives in 2023. We'll announce our pick for Game of the Year on Tuesday, December 13.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Elden Ring</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074486-1465202586-39449.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><em>Available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, PC</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Elden Ring is both the most ambitious game From Software has ever developed and the culmination of its many years perfecting the Souls formula. On paper, many of its new ideas shouldn't work, but Hidetaka Miyazaki and his team are considered some of the best game developers on the planet for a reason. For the first time, From Software uses an open-world design, yet it also manages to cleverly maintain the interconnected, locked-door-filled areas of its predecessors. It means that players are free to go nearly anywhere from the very beginning--provided they're up for the combat challenges--but they're still rewarded for careful exploration in the game's many dungeons, cathedrals, and dilapidated villages. A generous (by the developer's standards, at least) equipment-upgrading system encourages players to try out more than one type of weapon, and the many weapon arts and spells mean very few builds will ever be the same.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The freedom to choose your path also extends to the combat, which is, as expected from From Software, superb. The classic sword-and-shield approach is perfectly viable, but so is an ultra-fast nuisance wielding a giant pizza cutter who can make a copy of themselves. Making that choice is largely a matter of personal preference rather than needing <em>one </em>strategy to beat a particular boss, and if players find themselves struggling in a specific area, they can almost always take off in another direction and find a way to get stronger, coming back hours later to show that pesky dragon how a maiden-having Tarnished gets things done. Or, if they prefer, they can simply wander around The Lands Between and bask in its almost-angelic glow, which gives off a false sense of safety that hides the many horrors hiding behind nearly every corner.</p><p>Remarkably, despite its brutal difficulty and often-cryptic storytelling, Elden Ring is projected to be one of the best-selling games for all of 2022. It's a rarity that the most critically acclaimed game of the year also tops the charts, but it's also a rarity to get a game as special as Elden Ring. -- <em>Gabe Gurwin</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>God of War Ragnarok</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074487-0242653584-38795.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> <em>Available on PS5, PS4</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">God of War Ragnarok is the culmination of a character arc that, just a few years ago, sounded like a ludicrous proposition. And yet, developer Sony Santa Monica managed to pull off what felt like an impossible feat by depicting a journey that shows Kratos, the one-time Greek god of war known for brutality and absolute dedication to death and destruction, find balance as a father, a friend, and a champion for the future of the oppressed in the nine Norse realms.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This journey of growth is set against the backdrop of Ragnarok--the end of the world of gods and men--and comes as Kratos delicately attempts to guide his son, Atreus, through some of the same challenges that shaped him and brought out the worst in him. With the benefit of these life experiences and emotional growth, as well as kindness and love shown to him by his wife, Kratos finds himself better equipped to serve as a guiding hand for his son than ever. But it comes at a time when his son desperately seeks to forge his own path, which requires him to step out of his father's shadow.</p><p>This often fraught dynamic is what carries Kratos and Atreus through an odyssey that brings them both to blows with Thor, Odin, and other Norse gods, each of which is facing their own demons. God of War Ragnarok is a story of one father learning not to hold on too tight, while another uses his iron grip on his family for his selfish deeds. It's the story of a son understanding the value of wisdom that comes from experience, while another tries to break a cycle of self-destruction. But these are just a few of <em>many</em> themes in a game that is incredibly well-written and acted, as well as one of the best-playing action games of the year. -- <em>Tamoor Hussain</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Immortality</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074489-3121147364-IMMOR.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><em>Available on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, mobile</em> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">At first glance, Immortality doesn't look like a video game at all. Even after you begin playing it, you'd be hard-pressed to find many games that look like it, and even fewer than play like it. The only real comparisons one could draw would be the two games that developer Half Mermaid made before this one, and even then, Immortality builds on those games' genre-bending features in fascinating ways in order to deliver one of the year's absolute best video games. Using the now-signature stylings of live-action archival footage and the heart of a detective game, Immortality breaks new ground in the video game space to tell a unique story about artistry, its costs, and, well, a few other wrinkles you simply have to experience for yourself.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To speak to Immortality's strengths is harder than it is for most games, because the nature of Sam Barlow and his team's latest effort is deliberately evasive, asking players to search through hours and hours of movie recordings, invented wholecloth for the game's story, that span 30 years of a disappeared actress's career. What happened to Marissa Marcel? It's the million-dollar question implied as soon as you're placed in front of the game's faux-Moviola machine, which allows you to pause, rewind, fast-forward, and even click on pieces of a frame--a face, a knife, a pool of blood--and search the records for similar imagery. This constant thread-pulling is both deliberately imprecise and relentlessly engrossing. Even clicking on the same image twice, from slightly different angles or frames, can lead you down new proverbial rabbit holes, allowing this eight-hour game to reimagine the medium's common one-more-try design. Over time, you'll piece together the story like red string on a corkboard.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Answering the human questions of Immortality--Where is Marissa now? Why did her promising career fail to launch? What did Hollywood do to her?--are eventually revealed to be the corporeal stand-ins for more\u2026philosophical questions. These answers matter, and you'll get answers to at least some of the game's many mysteries, but its grander plans are not for sharing, they're for seeing for yourself.</p><p>There is a moment in Immortality that had me jump out of my seat in a way I always thought was an exaggeration when I've seen people do it in movies and TV. It comes at a time when the game reveals its secret hidden meaning I won't spoil here. This moment is even more compelling when you consider that it comes at a different time and in a different scene for different people because of the way each player moves through its time-twisting movie clips, table reads, and personal camcorder footage without a guiding hand. I'll think about this moment for a long time, and I'll remember Immortality as one of the best games of 2022 because, though this singular moment had me out of my seat, the entire experience kept me on the edge of it. <em>-- Mark Delaney</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mario + Rabbids Sparks Of Hope</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074491-1590652890-40519.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><em>Available on Switch</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">There's no feasible way Mario hanging out with the Rabbids should work, and yet developers Ubisoft Milan and Ubisoft Paris have managed to accomplish the feat twice. Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope is even better than the first outing, with Mario and friends joined by new characters Edge, Rabbid Rosalina, and Bowser in an action-adventure turn-based strategy game worthy of being one of the best games of 2022.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In a year full of excellent turn-based strategy games, Sparks of Hope stands out for the emphasis it places on movement within the scope of its tactical combat. The game lends great importance to a player's movement economy, not only creating a diverse variety of movements during your turn but also allowing your movements to influence the action economy and perform special attacks. Too often, moving from point A to point B is the most boring or inconsequential part of tactical turn-based games, but Sparks of Hope makes it the most exciting part of each battle.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Adding to that, Sparks of Hope builds on the success of its remarkable predecessor, with a tactical combat that remains approachable in terms of understanding how it works, but enjoyably challenging in how difficult it ultimately becomes. The game encourages you to think through the consequences of every movement and attack, rewarding a sound strategy. Much like Kingdom Battle, Sparks of Hope is endearingly charming as well, as voice acting brings the memorable personalities of the Rabbids to life in oftentimes hilarious ways.</p><p>Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope is just an all-around solid package of a game that's incredibly fun, which is why it's one of our favorite games of year. <em>-- Jordan Ram\u00e9e</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Marvel Snap</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074492-8269411229-40551.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><em> Available on PC, mobile</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">As the old saying goes, write what you know. In the case of Second Dinner, a new studio founded by Hearthstone veterans, that meant taking all the knowledge accumulated from their work on Blizzard's streamlined card battler and crafting something new. Marvel Snap is the result of those efforts, and for fans of CCGs it's easy to see how this fits into a continuum of the studio's design philosophy and refinement. For everyone else, it's just an incredibly fun, well-designed game that's hard to put down.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Marvel Snap is designed to fit right into your life. As a mobile-first game, it's optimized for the device you already have on you at all times. Matches are designed to be quick, lasting only two or three minutes apiece. Matchmaking is lightning-fast, letting you queue up and start a match in a matter of moments. Second Dinner carefully sanded off every possible point of friction to make the game inviting.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That ease of use doesn't come at the expense of its competitive bona fides, however. While it's easy to understand the fundamentals, the skill ceiling is high, letting you craft incredibly complex strategies. Randomized locations keep matches from feeling repetitive, and clever players can take advantage of Hot Locations that are currently in the rotation. Part of that strategy can revolve around bluffing or doubling down thanks to the Snap system, in which you wager rank points when you're certain of your impending victory--or if you just want to intimidate your opponent into retreating.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Marvel license is used to excellent effect here, with a wide array of both iconic heroes and obscure back-benchers. The card artwork is simply beautiful, and enhanced by an upgrade system that imbues it with impressive qualities like a sharp 3D effect. Upgrading your cards earns you more cards, creating a compelling loop of gameplay systems that feels fair and fuels every comic book fan's penchant for collecting.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Given all this, it would be easy for Marvel Snap to gouge customers, but, so far, the monetization in Marvel Snap seems almost <em>confusingly</em> fair. There is no way to pay your way to a better collection, as even the premium currency can only buy you variants and more Missions. A monthly season pass lets you earn new cards and variants, but they aren't especially overpowered compared to what you can earn for free. Second Dinner seems to know it's created something special here, and trusts that quality will sustain the game and the studio without predatory tactics.</p><p>And that's what makes Marvel Snap so surprising. It's a remarkably confident game right from the start, and it deserves to be. -- <em>Steve Watts</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Neon White</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074494-6607961025-Scree.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><em>Available on PC, Switch, PS4, PS5</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Speedrunning is a relatively niche thing--maybe you've watched a stream where someone rushed impossibly fast through a task that would take you 10 times as much time, or you've blasted through a Mario level with reckless abandon. Plenty of games put you on a timer and give you a deadline, but few are designed in a way to make you feel like a speedrunner. That's exactly what Neon White does, presenting thoughtfully crafted levels and challenges that, at first, may be difficult to complete in any amount of time, but will soon have you dashing through them more quickly than you ever thought possible.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The conceit of each stage in Neon White is simple: defeat every enemy and make it from the beginning to the end as quickly as you can. You'll always have access to a sword as a last resort, but along your path you'll find guns with a limited amount of ammo. The obvious--and often necessary--use for these is to fire them at enemies, but you also have the option of discarding each one in return for an associated one-off movement ability, like launching you up into the air, forward in a dash, and so on.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">These are essential for both basic navigation of levels, as well as making use of shortcuts you'll discover as you repeat a stage over and over to better your positioning on the leaderboards (or simply make it to the end). And it's in that loop of improvement that Neon White proves to be phenomenally satisfying. Your initial runs through a level may involve taking carefully considered shots at enemies and carefully minding any platforming, but that soon gives way to moving forward as if a rocket engine were attached to your back, blazing forward with what you would have previously thought to be an impossible amount of speed and precision.</p><p>The action and level design escalates over the course of the game as new weapons and enemies are introduced, ramping up the challenge of finding the minimum amount of gunfire needed to deal with foes so you can focus on beelining it from point A to B in as little time as possible. Seeing yourself improve and transform from a cautious explorer to a blistering speedrunner stage after stage is a thrill like little else. -- <em>Chris Pereira</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Norco</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074493-6529013310-39631.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><em>Available on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PS4</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's not often that we get to play a game that tackles the coercion of industrialization, the relationship between morality and technology, or the affairs of an estranged family that span generations. In fact, it's hard to come by any game that attempts to tackle these topics, let alone all three. Yet Norco manages to do all of it, and tell a story that is oftentimes as funny as it is heart-wrenching.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On the surface, Norco is a surreal, southern gothic set in a dystopian sci-fi depiction of New Orleans suburbia, told through a pixel-art point-and-click adventure. It opens with the story of Kay, a character coming home years later after learning about the death of her mother, and in the process, finds out that her brother has been missing. What unravels is a story that spans far beyond its family drama setup and expands into a tale that explores the underbelly of her small town.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Norco is at times ugly to look at, but not because of its art. It's in how it captures a New Orleans suburb that's been uprooted, contorted, and polluted by the oil refineries that surround it on all sides. But in its muted and muddled pixelated palette, it captures a colorful depiction of southern suburbia. In doing so, looking at it makes the world you explore all the more sad, as you bear witness firsthand to the lives affected most by industrialization. Every environment showcases the people who continue to live their normal lives, whether it's the teens outside the bookstore looking to get food for a lost dog, or the lowly hot dog vendor who's just trying to peddle his weeks-old inventory, it all feels tangible. And every interaction, despite the dire world it's in, is often funny, filled with thoughtful prose, and incredibly heartwarming.</p><p>Year after year, we're given spectacles that push the limits of technology and redefine what we think is possible in the medium, often leaning on big setpieces of AAA proportions. But Norco manages to tackle momentous topics seldom attempted in other games, and does so effortlessly through the lens of the lives of common folk, who are as believable as they are endearing. Norco isn't a big-budget game bursting at the seams of epic proportions. Instead, it whispers a southern gothic fairy tale that speaks louder than even the biggest games this year. <em>-- Kurt Indovina</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Pentiment</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074496-8598273544-40259.png\" /><br /><h3><p><em>Available on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC</em> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Pentiment is easy to dismiss as a niche game created for a niche group of players, but to do so would be a great disservice. While it's premise might not seem like something particularly relatable, as it follows a young artist creating illuminated manuscripts in the 16th century who finds himself tasked with solving a murder, Pentiment has a way of making a situation that seems so foreign into something intensely intimate. Coincidentally, this ties into the game's overall message: History is not some distant, detached concept, but rather an ever present force that creates us and much as we create it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In Pentiment, you are tasked with quite literally creating history, as it falls upon you to make countless decisions with dire consequences. These decisions range from deciding who protagonist Andreas Maler will supper with (and subsequently will learn vital information from), to who is ultimately guilty of murder and should be put to death. While more and more games are embracing giving players choice-driven experiences where time is a precious commodity, few are doing so quite as masterfully as Pentiment. As you gather information and experience all these defining moments in Andreas' life, you're never quite sure just which choices are the <em>right </em>choices--and for good reason.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Pentiment reinforces the idea that the search for truth is not only a daunting task, but an impossible one. While the truth might exist, it is ultimately molded by individual perspectives and oftentimes decided upon by history's winners. As the community Andreas finds himself a part of begins to unravel, plagued by high taxes, religious oppression, and civil disrest, these ideas come to a head and demand to be reckoned with.</p><p>However, Pentiment doesn't solely examine history, politics, and philosophy. It is also a celebration of the power of art and a source of comfort for those experiencing grief or depression. While there are several moments of hopelessness throughout the game--where it feels as if things couldn't possibly be worse--it is ultimately a hopeful story that wants us to know that not only are we better than our worst mistakes, but it's never too late to grow from them. Much like the illuminated manuscripts Andreas crafts, our choices become a beautiful, illustrated story, and we get to choose the ending. <em>-- Jessica Howard</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Tunic</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074497-6999821455-39529.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><em>Available on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, PS4</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Though Tunic had garnered a significant amount of buzz since its reveal at E3 2017, even its most devoted followers likely never anticipated that it would not only live up to the hype, but set a new benchmark for Zelda-like games. At first glance, it's easy to perceive Tunic as a colorful little action-adventure starring an adorable fox wielding a tiny sword. But once you wash up on the shore of the gorgeously rendered world, it doesn't take long to realize that Tunic cleverly subverts the ingrained expectations of the many odes to The Legend of Zelda that came before it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In defiance of the modern game design tendency to guide players to destinations and solutions, Tunic admirably views its players as true explorers, emphasizing the wonder of exploration and discovery. Scattered throughout the world are individual pages of a manual that, together, resemble the thick game manuals that often used to be included inside game boxes. This design feature is both a charming callback and an integral part of what makes Tunic so darn inventive. The pages offer subtle clues on where to go next, providing new context for previously visited areas, and slyly hint at solutions to the deftly crafted puzzles. Even Tunic's combat and character progression systems are linked to the game manual. Only by pouring over the manual can you begin to decipher Tunic's many secrets. And you'll definitely want to decode the mysteries, as Tunic has some seriously mind-blowing puzzles.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The overarching game manual conceit is complemented by a world design that encourages searching every nook and cranny. Seemingly hidden passages give way to new areas and secrets only when you make the conscious decision to investigate thoroughly. The art direction and isometric camera perspective bolsters these illusions, giving way to delightful aha moments.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Though Tunic's world seems adorable, it's also quite dangerous. Taking a Souls-like approach, the combat is nuanced and methodical, relying heavily on well-timed parries and dodges. Even small enemies pose a thrilling threat, and the larger-than-life bosses reward those who have scoured the world for upgrades that help in battle. But if you want to be an explorer without hitting combat roadblocks, Tunic has great accessibility options to tailor the experience to your liking.</p><p>When you consider the fact the game was designed by solo developer Andrew Shouldice, Tunic becomes all the more impressive.<em> -- Steven Petite</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Vampire Survivors</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4074498-5529468661-40635.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><em>Available on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, mobile</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's cheap. It's ugly. And it's easily one of the best games of 2022. Vampire Survivors is the clearest example of how compelling a simple concept and <em>fantastic</em> game feel can be. Part shoot-em-up and part roguelite, Vampire Survivors floods the screen with crudely drawn monster sprites that look ripped from a Castlevania asset pack. Your character attacks automatically, so your entire focus is on using a single thumbstick to move out of harm's way by thinning out their numbers and threading yourself through openings. The objective? Survive for 30 minutes, before the Grim Reaper appears to deliver a predetermined death.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The intricacies lie in how you develop your character in those 30 minutes. Each enemy drops experience, which increases your level and allows you to outfit your character with additional tools and abilities to keep improving your odds of survival. These range from the almighty garlic, which creates a radius of damage around you, and a set of bibles that constantly orbit your character to damage anything that gets close, to lightning strikes that smite enemies, throwing knives that will launch in the direction you're facing, and holy water that does area-of-effect damage.</p><p>These tools can be leveled up to improve their effectiveness and, eventually, combined along an evolutionary path that will change how they behave. The crucial thing here is, everything you're doing is pushing your character toward becoming an unstoppable and indestructible monster-slayer. Level up the right tools and evolve them properly and soon you'll be able to saunter through hordes of enemies slashing, burning, and eviscerating them all in satisfying ways. The power trip that comes from doing so is frighteningly moreish, so you'll come back to unlock more stages and characters time after time, burning through hours of playtime as instantaneously as you demolish enemies. -- <em>Tamoor Hussain</em></p></h3></p><br />", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mrbeast-is-coming-to-fortnite-and-giving-one-player-a-million-dollars/1100-6509934/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "MrBeast Is Coming To Fortnite And Giving One Player A Million Dollars", "date_published": "2022-12-12 17:00:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Epic Games has partnered with YouTuber MrBeast for a <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/\">Fortnite </a>collaboration.

According to director Masaru Yamamura--who served as project lead on Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice--boss battles will be challenging and will require players to tinker with their mechs before they challenge a massive armored core on the battlefield.</p><p>\"Boss battles are the highlight of the game in this title,\" Yamamura said to <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/armored-core-6-interview\">IGN</a>. \"The essence of the battles, in which the player reads the enemy's moves and then plays games with them, is of course provided, as is typical of From Software.

Don't expect this new entry in the mech series to adopt a Soulsborne approach to gameplay though, as From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki explained in a recent interview that Armored Core VI's gameplay will emphasize what makes the series so special.</p><p>\"No, we've not been making a conscious effort to try to direct it towards more Soulsborne-type gameplay. First of all, let me just make that clear,\" Miyazaki said to <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/armored-core-6-interview\">IGN</a>. \"The essential direction of [Armored Core VI] was to go back and take a good look at the core concept of Armored Core and what made that series special.\"</p><p>According to Miyazaki, this includes the assembly aspect and customizing your titular armored core, with From Software looking to reexamine those ideas through a more modern lens.

Curiously, Returnal's RAM requirements are much higher than previous PlayStation ports, as you'll need 32GB of RAM to keep the roguelite action flowing smoothly.</p><p>That's according to the Steam listing for the game (as spotted by <a href=\"https://wccftech.com/returnal-pc-requirements-detailed-no-crossplay-with-ps5/\">WccfTech</a>), which requires a minimum of 16GB of RAM just to get started. What makes this number stand out is that other graphically demanding games such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Dying Light 2 have run just fine with between 8-16GB of RAM, and even several of Sony's previous ports haven't required that much RAM unless you were looking for a 4K experience with every PC setting set to the highest possible level. Returnal is a PS5 console-exclusive and wasn't available on PS4 like several other first-party games from PlayStation, which could explain its demanding requirements.</p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-miles-morales-hits-pc-on-november-18-system-requirements-and-graphics-options-detailed/1100-6508256/\">Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales recommends</a> 16GB of RAM if you're planning to play at a resolution of 1440p at 60 FPS with ultra ray-tracing settings enabled, and 32GB of RAM if you want to bump the experience up to 4K. Beyond that, the rest of Returnal's requirements are pretty standard according to its <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1649240/Returnal/\">Steam page listing</a>. An Nvidia RTX 2070 or AMD RX 6700 XT graphics card will be able to render all the alien terror in Returnal just fine, and you'll need to have 60GB of storage space available.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/returnal-is-going-to-require-a-lot-of-ram-to-run-smoothly-on-pc/1100-6509941/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crime-boss-rockay-city-gameplay-video-showcases-high-stakes-heist-mission/1100-6509942/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Crime Boss: Rockay City Gameplay Video Showcases High-Stakes Heist Mission", "date_published": "2022-12-12 14:30:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">We knew about the star-studded cast for the recently revealed Crime Boss: Rockay City, but we didn't know what actual gameplay looked like for the FPS.

While at a preview event ahead of the game's release next month, I was able to play the upcoming action-RPG and the first few minutes filled me with trepidation. The dialogue was too cute by half, and the combat felt cumbersome. However, those early growing pains slowly subsided as I continued on until eventually, time slipped away without my notice. Despite a rocky start, Forspoken found its stride and showed real promise.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Those awkward early moments have already been a dominant topic of conversation after a trailer in August inspired a flurry of conversation across social media about Frey's running \"well, <em>that</em> just happened\" style of narration. That trailer was largely from the earliest part of the game I played, Chapter 2, and yes, that element is absolutely present. If anything, there's more of it. Frey talks to herself and her sentient vambrace, nicknamed Cuff, <em>constantly</em>, narrating her way through events and repeatedly pointing out how unbelievable it all is. Hailing from New York, she often drops casual references and slang from her world only to be met with a confused \"huh?\" from those around her, forcing her to explain herself or shrug it off with a hasty \"never-mind.\" It happens so much, in fact, that it gets a little grating--come on, Frey, shouldn't you have figured out to just stop using idioms by now?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I was similarly put off by the very earliest taste of combat. Frey starts off with just a handful of magical abilities, a family of purple magic representing the element of earth. In practice, these are ranged spells with some minor variations: a standard shot that can be charged for a more powerful burst, a weaker rapid-fire spell, and a rudimentary shield that can burst out and deal damage at close range. It takes place in third-person, so these are basically magic-guns with the over-the-shoulder perspective you'd expect from a third-person shooter. The earliest fights, especially before Frey starts to get her magic-enhanced movement abilities, felt like trying to dance with bricks tied to my calves.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forspokens-awkward-start-gives-way-to-fun-super-fast-combat-and-traversal/1100-6509926/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}], "source url": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "source title": "GameSpot"}
