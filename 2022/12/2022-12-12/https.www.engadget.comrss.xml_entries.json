True, it only has a small status-only display instead of a touchscreen, there's no photo mode and the unit did get a bit hot shooting in 5.3K at 60fps indoors. That said, you can control the Mini via the app on your phone, you can pull stills from video to get around the no-photo-mode limitation and the overheating disappears when shooting at lower definitions.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Limitations aside, where the camera excels is as a helmet- or body-mounted action cam, or as a secondary shot-getter. It has a second pair of mounting fingers that make it easier to face the camera forward and it includes many of the features \u2014 like horizon lock and Hyperview mode \u2014 that make its larger sibling so capable.

If you decide you do want a screen, this is a good time to grab the bigger version.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the subscription, it's a $50-per-year service that gets you unlimited cloud storage and automatic uploads when the camera is plugged in. It also grants you a camera replacement should you smash yours in service of getting a particularly good shot. The subscription also gets you up to 50 percent off at GoPro.com, and could theoretically pay for itself if you plan on buying a lot of accessories.&nbsp;</p><p>You can always cancel the service before you're charged again next year, so there's little reason not to go for the $150 off.

That\u2019s a lot of money for a Chromebook \u2013 but if it can last you five years or more, it might be worth the cost.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"8a70bdb1faed40cbbcb2ee6993908ea5\"></div><h2>Hardware</h2><p>Visually, the Framework Chromebook has little to distinguish it. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, but it is very utilitarian, with a silver aluminum chassis that resembles so many other devices out there. Still, it\u2019s a pretty compact device, less than two-thirds of an inch thick and weighing under three pounds. A classy reflective Framework logo on the lid is the only thing distinguishing it from an Acer, ASUS and other brands\u2019 laptops.</p><p>A day or two later, I discovered that the Framework Chromebook <em>does</em> have one bit of flair: the black bezel around the screen is magnetic and easily removable. Framework actually provided me with a fun orange option, which I left on. You can also get a silver bezel if you want, but orange is a personal favorite. I\u2019m hoping the company adds a few more colors in the future as well.</p><p>Inside that bezel is a 1080p webcam that\u2019s totally fine for video calling. Also of interest is the fact that there are hardware switches for disabling the camera and microphones. This isn\u2019t just a software trick either; the switches actually cut the power to those modules, making it a fairly secure option (though a physical cover over the camera would be pretty impenetrable, too).</p><figure><img alt=\"Photos of Framework's first modular and repairable Chromebook.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/9438a290-7a2d-11ed-bfb9-d2eaded0b4e9\" style=\"height: 1600; width: 2400;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>While Framework devices are upgradeable, a few things are more permanent \u2013 namely, the display and keyboard. (You can replace both if they break, but there aren\u2019t more advanced versions to upgrade your laptop with at this time. That could change, of course). Fortunately, both are excellent, as you\u2019d hope for in a laptop at this price. The 13.5-inch display has a high resolution of 2,256 x 1,504, which translates to&nbsp; a taller 3:2 aspect ratio that I wish were more common.</p><p>The main downside is that it\u2019s not a touchscreen, something you\u2019ll find on most Chromebooks. That makes installing touch-driven Android apps less appealing, though at this point most of the apps I use (Lightroom, Todoist, Spotify and video apps like Netflix) work fine with a keyboard and mouse. That minor disappointment aside, the screen is great. Text and images are sharp, and its 400-nit max brightness is more than sufficient unless you have sunlight coming through and shining right on the display.</p><figure><img alt=\"Photos of Framework's first modular and repairable Chromebook.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/943b88c0-7a2d-11ed-b77f-3c249391e8c9\" style=\"height: 1600; width: 2400;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>As you\u2019d expect, Framework swapped out the Windows keyboard layout for one that will feel familiar to Chromebook users, with the \u201ceverything\u201d button on the left in place of caps lock and the function row shortcuts like back, refresh and screenshot right where I expected. There\u2019s no Google Assistant key, but you can easily access the Assistant in the ChromeOS search bar if you\u2019re so inclined. The keyboard itself is excellent; the backlit buttons have 1.5mm of travel and are solid and precise. The key caps are a bit small, but it didn\u2019t take me long to adjust. I do wish that Framework included the fingerprint sensor found on its Windows laptop, though. Given that plenty of other Chromebooks support fingerprint unlocking, I\u2019m surprised it isn\u2019t available here.</p><p>At $999, the Framework Chromebook isn\u2019t cheap, but the company didn\u2019t spare any expense with the processor. It features Intel\u2019s 12th-generation Core i5-1240P CPU, along with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage on the base model. Most Chromebooks with comparable specs are similarly priced, so Framework\u2019s laptop isn\u2019t excessively expensive \u2013 but the question, as always, is whether spending that much money on a ChromeOS device is a good idea at all.</p><section><img alt=\"Photos of Framework's first modular and repairable Chromebook.\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/9451a8d0-7a2d-11ed-afff-7369236a1f6e\" /></section><h2>Swappable ports and expansion</h2><p>Let\u2019s get into what makes the Framework Chromebook unique. Instead of having a set of unchangeable ports, there are four slots for user-selectable Expansion Cards. Framework offers sockets for USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, DisplayPort, Ethernet and microSD. Additionally, you can use those connections for easily-swappable storage; Framework offers 250GB and 1TB modules. All the Expansion Cards are USB-C based; the ports on the laptop itself are just four recessed USB-C openings. This means you could use the storage cards with other computers to easily move files around.</p><p>I went with two USB-C ports (one on each side), USB-A and HDMI. Framework helpfully included an LED light on each side of the laptop so you confirm when you\u2019re charging and when the battery is full. Everything functioned as I would have expected: the HDMI port worked just fine with my external monitor, and my old USB-A flash drive showed up with no issues. I also tested out the Ethernet Expansion Card, which was plug-and-play simple (though it\u2019s bigger than the other cards and thus sticks out of the side of the machine).</p><figure><img alt=\"Photos of Framework's first modular and repairable Chromebook.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/943bafd0-7a2d-11ed-9fbd-d643551d1e49\" style=\"height: 1600; width: 2400;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>I\u2019m of two minds when it comes to these modules. On the one hand, the ability to customize what ports are available on your computer is pretty damn cool. If I used microSD or Ethernet more, for example, I\u2019d love the ability to swap those in, or just load up on USB-C ports if I had a lot of compatible peripherals. But there are also plenty of Chromebooks that have USB-A, HDMI and microSD slots, which makes the Framework\u2019s modular slots a little less compelling to me.</p><p>However, the fact that <em>my </em>needs are modest doesn\u2019t change the fact that there are probably lots of people who want more flexibility in their laptop. Being able to drop an Ethernet port in for when you\u2019re doing a lot of downloading and then swap it for USB-A if you\u2019re hooking up older accessories is undeniably useful. It also future-proofs this laptop quite a bit. If you get rid of all your USB-A gadgets, for example, just throw in another UBC-C port or add more storage. There are tons of possibilities here that you just don\u2019t get from a standard laptop.</p><section><img alt=\"Photos of Framework's first modular and repairable Chromebook.\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/944c51a0-7a2d-11ed-bfdf-fe7911c250f6\" /></section><p>These swappable ports are only one facet of the Framework Chromebook\u2019s flexibility. Using the included Torx T5 screwdriver, I was able to loosen the five screws on the underside of the laptop and then lift the keyboard deck right off, exposing the laptop\u2019s innards. It\u2019s all laid out clearly and everything is labeled, and there are QR codes you can scan to go directly to upgrade guides. I didn\u2019t change much under the hood, but Framework provided me with a second 8GB memory chip that I was able to install in about five minutes. I can\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019ve been able to upgrade my laptop\u2019s RAM like this, and with two slots I could shove in up to 64GB of memory. That\u2019s something that will make this Chromebook a useful machine for a long time.</p><p>And that\u2019s to say nothing about upgrading the processor. The Framework Chromebook has Intel\u2019s latest-gen chip on board, so there\u2019s no need to change it now. But, Framework has already started offering new \u201cmainboards\u201d for its Windows laptop, which originally shipped with an 11th-generation Intel CPU. It seems likely that in a few years, when Intel has newer chips available, Framework will let you swap them in and give your old laptop a nice performance bump.</p><p>Another cool point about the swappable mainboard is the fact that if you decide ChromeOS isn\u2019t for you, you could pick up a Windows-compatible mainboard and move on with your life running Microsoft\u2019s OS. Framework says that the Chromebook has some ChromeOS-specific parts and firmware, which is why you can\u2019t just wipe the device and install Windows. But being able to swap the mainboard and keyboard for Windows-compatible is another example of the customization at the heart of Framework.</p><figure><img alt=\"Photos of Framework's first modular and repairable Chromebook.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/943bafd0-7a2d-11ed-bdfb-087d422dbb5d\" style=\"height: 1600; width: 2400;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2>In use</h2><p>As you\u2019d expect, using the Framework Chromebook was basically identical to any other Chromebook with these specs. It\u2019s a snappy, responsive laptop that can handle basically anything you might want to do in ChromeOS, including those aforementioned Android apps as well as web apps and a ton of Chrome tabs.</p><p>Battery life is the main downside here. I only got a little over six hours unplugged doing my normal work routine, and the battery lasted about eight hours and 15 minutes when looping playback of an HD video stored locally on the laptop. Framework did note there\u2019s a battery-draining bug when using the laptop with either the HDMI or DisplayPort expansion cards installed; that should be fixed in a future software update. But even without those cards installed, I still got the same six or so hours of battery life.</p><figure><img alt=\"Photos of Framework's first modular and repairable Chromebook.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/944cc6d0-7a2d-11ed-aee3-150a2fd3404b\" style=\"height: 1600; width: 2400;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>After my time with this Chromebook, I\u201dm officially a fan of what Framework is doing. The laptop has few compromises compared to most other ChromeOS devices, namely battery life and a rather pedestrian appearance. But don\u2019t mistake the lack of flash for poor design. The Framework Chromebook is extremely repairable for ordinary humans while still keeping a relatively small and light frame. And it also has a great screen and keyboard to go along with its powerful, upgradeable internals.</p><p>At $999, it\u2019s one of the more expensive Chromebooks on the market, and you could get a comparable device like the Asus Chromebook Spin 714 for the comparatively low cost of $729. But, that device isn\u2019t repairable or upgradeable at all, while the Framework Chromebook can easily be fixed by most people who buy one \u2013 and owners can also add more storage, RAM and hopefully even replace the processor down the line to keep it alive for a lot longer than your average laptop. For some people, especially those who feel like our gadgets shouldn\u2019t be disposable things we replace every few years, that makes the Framework Chromebook worth the premium.</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/discord-connections-server-roles-170028296.html?src=rss", "title": "Discord users can soon verify their identities with linked accounts", "date_published": "2022-12-12 17:00:28+00:00", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/discord/\"><ins>Discord</ins></a> is expanding on Connections, a feature that allows users to show what <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-01-spotify-discord-partnership.html\"><ins>music they're listening to</ins></a> (among other things), by <a href=\"http://discord.com/blog/connections\">providing a way</a> for folks to verify their identity using accounts on other platforms.

The QuietComfort 45 can still connect to multiple devices at once, though, and unlike the XM5, its design can fold up for easier storage. It also uses physical control buttons.

After all, I thought, it works with my MacBook Pro, I type relatively well on it, and that\u2019s what I need from a keyboard.</p><p>Yet, I harbored a secret lust for mechanical keyboards. There\u2019s a part of me that misses the tactile feel of the chunky keyboards of my youth, especially as someone who spends so much time typing like I do. Plus, since I\u2019m working from home full-time now, I no longer have to worry about annoying cubicle neighbors with the sound of my typing.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>So, a few months ago, I decided on a whim to look into the whole mechanical keyboard thing a little more. It took me weeks of research, but I finally found one that seems to fit all my needs: the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BaXI3NS1NZWNoYW5pY2FsLUNvbm5lY3Rpb24tQ29tcGF0aWJsZS1TeXN0ZW1zLUdhdGVyb24vZHAvQjA5S0c2TVNWSD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1iZC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGQxN2MxOTUtNDY3MC00YmMxLTk1MTYtNzVjOTk0YjI4NmU5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAeZZt7X4QChE2tfZUE57r5R389KzXlKVCauDKsLSrc1L&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAir75-Mechanical-Connection-Compatible-Systems-Gateron%2Fdp%2FB09KG6MSVH\">NuPhy Air75</a>. As it turns out, I fell down a rabbit hole when researching this space. I ended up reading lots of reviews, watching dozens of YouTube videos and diving deep into the product category. I learned about different kinds of keyboards (full-size, tenkeyless, 75 percent, 65 percent), various switches (linear, tactile, clicky), keycaps and so much more. To be honest, I was a little intimidated by it all, but after all this research, I was sold. That luscious sound of clicky keys finally got me to consider getting one.</p><figure><img alt=\"NuPhy Air75\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/8717fa90-74bd-11ed-bdfc-c2eb336346b2\" /><figcaption>NuPhy Air75</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p>My research helped me set a few important criteria for the keyboard I wanted. First and foremost, I wanted one with a Mac-specific layout. I know that most keyboards will work with both Macs and PCs, but not all have Mac layouts and I really just prefer the keys to match the OS that I\u2019m using. Next, it needs to be wireless \u2014 I don\u2019t like cords and cables messing up my desk. I also wanted the keyboard to support multiple devices so that I could easily switch it between my work and personal laptops. Additionally, I prefer hot-swappable switches and keycaps so that I could have the freedom to swap them out if I wanted. Last but not least, I wanted a relatively low-profile keyboard, as I didn\u2019t want to use a wrist rest.</p><p>That\u2019s how I settled on the NuPhy Air75. It\u2019s Mac friendly, low-profile, has hot-swappable switches and it\u2019s wireless, with the ability to connect up to four devices \u2013 three via Bluetooth and one via a 2.4GHz receiver. I also really like the 75-percent size, as the layout is similar to what I\u2019m already used to with the Apple keyboards. Importantly, I could also purchase it right away from Amazon instead of having to wait for a group order, which is a common practice in the mechanical keyboard market. As for the switches, I chose the Gateron Brown tactile ones as I\u2019ve read reviews that suggest they\u2019re a good middle ground between the smooth linear Red switches and the clickier Blue switches.</p><p>I\u2019ve now been using the Air75 for months, and I adore it. I\u2019ll admit that it took me a while to get accustomed to it at first. The keys have a relatively short travel distance thanks to how low-profile they are and I made a lot of typos in the beginning. But I soon got used to the layout, and typing on it is now second nature to me. I love the feel of the Brown switches, too.</p><figure><img alt=\"NuPhy Air75\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/c23186a0-74bd-11ed-afbf-1d87ac536621\" /><figcaption>NuPhy Air75</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p>I also really like the overall build quality of the Air75. The aluminum frame is solid, and the default PBT (Polybutylene terephthalate) keycaps have a great look and feel as well. I like that the spacebar and Enter keys are yellow and orange respectively. The keyboard has two LED light strips on either side that I find quite attractive, plus they\u2019re functional; you can customize them so that they light up if the keyboard is low on battery, or when the caps lock is engaged. In addition, it\u2019s super easy to connect via Bluetooth, and swapping the keyboard between my two laptops is simple as well (it\u2019s just a matter of pressing the Function key and an assigned number).</p><p>I do have a couple of nitpicks, though. The NuPhy Air75 has a RGB lighting feature, but because the keys are low-profile and not translucent, it\u2019s pretty hard to notice them. I ended up not using it at all because it does drain the keyboard\u2019s battery. Another is that due to the low-profile nature of the keyboard, it\u2019s difficult to find third-party keycaps that will fit in the aluminum frame (there just aren\u2019t that many low-profile keycaps on the market). One of the features of customizable mechanical keyboards like these is that you can easily swap out keycaps to whatever color and design you want, but that\u2019s not so easy here.</p><p>I saw a YouTube video a few months ago that compared the feeling of typing on a mechanical keyboard to that of writing with a fountain pen, and I have to agree. Fountain pens make handwriting such a joy thanks to how fluid and smooth it feels. Similarly, typing on the NuPhy Air75 is a pleasure because of that tactile and satisfying feedback. Now that I\u2019ve tried mechanical keyboards like the NuPhy Air75, I don\u2019t think I can ever go back to the standard Apple models.</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-soundbars-143041791.html?src=rss", "title": "The best soundbars for 2022", "date_published": "2022-12-12 15:01:06+00:00", "description": "<p>It's no secret that the built-in speakers in most TVs are trash. They don't project enough sound out to the front so you can hear well \u2014 especially subtle details. Thankfully, you don't have to splurge for a five-speaker (or more)<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-to-build-a-budget-home-theater-setup-140010399.html\"> surround-sound setup</a> to fix the problem. In most living rooms, a single soundbar and maybe a subwoofer will suffice. To help guide your shopping spree, we've compiled a list of everything to look for when searching for the best soundbar for you, along with a list of the top picks for a range of budgets.</p><h2>What to look for in a soundbar</h2><h3>Features</h3><p>When it comes to features, the more you pay the more you're going to get. Most affordable options ($150 or less) will improve your television's audio, but that's about it. Step into the $300 to $400 range and you'll find things like built-in voice control, wireless connectivity, Chromecast, AirPlay 2 and even Android TV. They're all helpful when you want to avoid looking for the remote, but the best audio quality is usually only in the top tier and the formats those premium devices support. I\u2019m talking about things like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and other high-resolution audio standards. These are what you'll want to look for if truly immersive sound is what you crave for your living room setup. And not all Atmos soundbars are equal, so you'll need to look at the finer details carefully before you break into the savings account.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h3>Ports</h3><figure><img alt=\"Sony HT-A7000 soundbar, SA-SW5 subwoofer, SA-SW3 subwoofer and SA-RS3S speakers.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cfb15b20-e904-11eb-9f99-c08983de4f5c\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sony</div></figure><p>This is a big one. A lot of the more affordable soundbars have limited options when it comes to connectivity. They either offer an optical port or one HDMI jack and, if you're lucky, both. Things get slightly better in the mid-range section, but that's not always the case. The Sonos Beam, for example, is $449, but only has a single HDMI port. If you want to connect your set-top box, gaming console and more directly to your soundbar for the best possible audio, you'll likely want to look for an option with at least two HDMI (eARC) inputs. HDMI connections are essential for things like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and other high-res and immersive audio formats. And with<a href=\"https://www.hdmi.org/spec/hdmi2_1\"> the HDMI 2.1 spec</a>, soundbars can support HDR, 8K and 4K/120 passthrough to make these speakers an even better companion for a game console.</p><h3>Channels</h3><p>Another big thing you\u2019ll want to pay attention to is channels. That\u2019s the 2.1, 7.1.2 or other decimal number that companies include in product descriptions. The first figure corresponds to the number of channels. A two would just be left and right while a more robust Atmos system, especially one with rear satellite speakers, could be five or seven (left, right, center and upward). The second number refers to the subwoofer, so if your soundbar comes with one or has them built in, you\u2019ll see a one here. The third numeral is up-firing speakers, important for the immersive effect of Dolby Atmos. Not all Atmos-enabled units have them, but if they do, the third number will tell you how many are in play.</p><h3>Wireless</h3><figure><img alt=\"Sony HT-A7000 soundbar, SA-SW5 subwoofer, SA-SW3 subwoofer and SA-RS3S speakers.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cff960a0-e904-11eb-ad7a-7525dbfffb3a\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sony</div></figure><p>Most soundbars these days offer either Bluetooth, WiFi or both. When it comes to WiFi, that connectivity affords you luxuries like voice control (either built-in or with a separate device), Chromecast, Spotify Connect and AirPlay 2. Depending on your preferences, you might be able to live without some of these. For me, AirPlay 2 and Chromecast are essentials, but the rest I can live without. Those two give me the ability to beam music and podcasts from my go-to apps without having to settle for \u2014 or struggle with \u2014 a Bluetooth connection.</p><h3>Size</h3><p>This one might seem obvious but humor me for a minute. Nothing is more soul-crushing than getting a pricey soundbar in your living room only to discover you have to rearrange everything to find a spot for it. This was my plight when the<a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TZW5uaGVpc2VyLUFNQkVPLVNvdW5kYmFyLTUtMS00LUNoYW5uZWwvZHAvQjA4Sjk5UjhXSj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1jaS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTBhOTBkN2YtODQ5ZS00NGYwLWJjNGQtODY3MmM4M2QwMDZkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdSXCtH3GZlqKOEeTxYF-ucIgg9x4QArao7UtuglYKcD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSennheiser-AMBEO-Soundbar-5-1-4-Channel%2Fdp%2FB08J99R8WJ%3F\"> Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar</a> arrived at my door. Yes, that speaker is absurdly large (and heavy), and most soundbars aren't nearly as big. I learned a valuable lesson: Make sure the space where you want to put a soundbar will accommodate the thing you're about to spend hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars on.</p><p>Basically, it all comes down to the TV you have (or are planning to get) and what the primary goal is for your living-room audio. Is it ease of use? Do you want the best possible sound from a single speaker or speaker/sub combo? Do you just want to be able to actually hear your TV better? Or do you want to turn your living room into an immersive home theater?</p><p>By paying attention to each of those areas, you should have a good idea of what to look for in a soundbar, soundbar/sub combo or a more robust setup. With that said, we've put numerous products through their paces at Engadget and have a few favorites at various price points to get you started.</p><h2>Best premium soundbar: Sony HT-A7000</h2><p></p><p>Sony has a long track record of excellent high-end soundbars and<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-ht-a7000-soundbar-ht-a9-home-theater-system-140038379.html\"> its latest</a> is another great-sounding product.

For that reason, the company doesn\u2019t think you\u2019ll need a dedicated sub. Indeed, the Panorama 3 does offer ample bass, but it\u2019s not nearly on the level as a standalone unit. This soundbar does have a low-profile, refined design alongside voice capabilities, \u201chidden until lit\u201d touch controls and support for aptX Adaptive, AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect. Most importantly, it\u2019s currently available for $200 less than the original MSRP at $799.</p><h2>Best midrange soundbar: Sonos Beam</h2><p></p><p>Solid sound quality? Check. Dolby Atmos? Yep. Compact and easy to set up? Uh huh. Compatible with other Sonos products for a more robust system? You betcha. The first-gen Sonos Beam has been one of our favorites<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-27-sonos-beam-review.html\"> since it arrived in 2018</a>, but there was one thing it didn\u2019t have: Dolby Atmos.

Sonos manages to make things seem more directional by tweaking audio timing and frequency instead of adding more drivers.<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-beam-gen-2-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-130024506.html\"> The new Beam</a> still only has the one HDMI port which means you won\u2019t be connecting a gaming console or set-top box directly to this. It also means that if you have an older TV with an optical jack, you\u2019ll need an adapter.</p><h2>Runner-up midrange soundbar: Samsung HW-Q700B</h2><p></p><p>Samsung\u2019s mid-range <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TQU1TVU5HLUhXLVE3MDBCLTMtMS0yY2gtU291bmRiYXItV2lyZWxlc3MvZHAvQjA5WDYxRk40OD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1jaS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTBhOTBkN2YtODQ5ZS00NGYwLWJjNGQtODY3MmM4M2QwMDZkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfji-2qNCAI8DQjuHvNIP5VScZcdqHpPz_jsg8rsgpyW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSAMSUNG-HW-Q700B-3-1-2ch-Soundbar-Wireless%2Fdp%2FB09X61FN48\">Q700B</a> will cost you $700, but it comes with a bundled subwoofer. This model also supports wireless Dolby Atmos connectivity with 2022 Samsung smart TVs over WiFi and the 3.1.2-channel configuration includes up-firing speakers for proper immersive sound. The Q700B supports Q-Symphony which allows you to use both the soundbar and your TV speakers for a more robust setup on some 2021 and 2022 Samsung TVs. SpaceFit Sound automatically calibrates the soundbar/sub combo to a room, Adaptive Sound optimizes audio for specific content types and Tap Sound allows you to send tunes from a Samsung phone to the Q700B with a simple tap. HDMI eARC connectivity is here as well, and so is voice control, AirPlay, Chromecast and a gaming-specific audio mode.</p><h2>Another midrange option: Sonos Ray</h2><p></p><p>Sonos\u2019 latest soundbar may be its most affordable to date, but at $279, it\u2019s not exactly a budget pick. Especially when you consider there are cheaper options that come with a subwoofer. Still, the compact design doesn\u2019t command a lot of space in front of your TV, making it a great option for smaller living spaces. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvcmF5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlMGE5MGQ3Zi04NDllLTQ0ZjAtYmM0ZC04NjcyYzgzZDAwNmQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfKSgw-aCz0Rbp-651h22Yv_dlsri1UlZQC5hXkCcVzM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fray\">The Ray</a> is easy to set up and provides great sound quality for both TV and music. There are some trade-offs when it comes to the immersive nature of the audio, but it\u2019s a good option for upgrading your TV sound with minimal fuss.</p><h2>Best budget soundbar: Vizio V21t-J8</h2><p></p><p>If you\u2019re looking for a way to improve your TV sound on a budget, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/vizio-m-series-quantum-x-tvs-elevate-soundbar-100052598.html\">Vizio has some solid options</a>.

This would be a great choice if you don\u2019t want your add-on TV speaker to take up a lot of space. There\u2019s no WiFi connectivity, but that\u2019s really the only sacrifice when it comes to the basics.

They offer a comfortable fit, balanced-yet-strong bass, workout-ready water resistance and active noise cancellation at a lower price than some AirPods models. Throw in a healthy six-hour battery life and a choice of colors and these may be the best balance between capability and price.</p><p>There are a few catches worth noting. While the Beats Fit Pro are more Android-friendly than AirPods, they're still optimized for Apple devices. There's no wireless charging, and some users might accidentally push buttons on occasion. You'll want the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218.html\">second-generation AirPods Pro</a> for the best in-ear audio Apple has to offer.

Almost immediately they have to fight off mutated monsters and zombies and figure out how to get back home \u2013 probably saving this world on the way.</p><p>While we know the magical attacks in <em>Forspoken</em> are spectacular, my one-on-one battle with Sila, the Tanta of Strength, made the biggest impression during my preview session \u2013 and the best showcase for all the attacks and moves you\u2019ll be able to master.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"921c49b94fe34a509146bd70f9d29a69\"></div><p>What are the Tantas? They are a handful of sorceresses that rule the medieval, but shattered, land of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ps5-project-athia-luminous-productions-preview-203354543.html\">Athia</a>. Yes, be prepared for a barrage of lore and encyclopedic entries on the history, flora and fauna of Athia \u2013 but at least I could look up everything in the menu if I ever got lost. The protagonist Frey comes with emotional baggage, some misdemeanors and a mysterious origin story of being abandoned at a train station \u2013 something that I\u2019m sure will be revisited later in the game. She\u2019s just as new to this world as you, but she still loves dropping the f-bomb and assorted swear words at every opportunity. I\u2019m not a prude, it just feels excessive and immature. Hopefully, this angst tempers as the game progresses.</p><p>The world of <em>Forspoken</em> is a mixture of natural beauty, paranormal detritus and towns, buildings and structures from when the world hadn\u2019t been turned upside down by what Frey calls the Break. And you can see why: It\u2019s a huge, broken world, with glowing crystal formations jutting out of cliffs and hills. Animals and people have been transformed into fearsome beasts and zombies. Your first interaction with the locals (after hiding from a dragon), is some sort of dog-bear... thing with teeth from top to bottom. This confrontation leads to you discovering some magical gifts from Cuff \u2013 a mysterious bangle that tags along for your adventure (and is almost <em>definitely</em> critical to the story).</p><p>There\u2019s a connection between the aforementioned Tanta, a war, and whatever went wrong with, you know, with the entire world. And probably a good reason why a portal opened to our Earth when Frey got her hands on that magical bangle.</p><p>Cuff isn\u2019t only around for the (often shoehorned) narrative exposition. It offers a degree of defense (your health bar comes from the bangle, not Frey herself), but also imbues the character with an array of plant- and earth-based magical spells. These translate to support (plant) and attack (earth).</p><p>I enjoyed mixing them up. Attack spells are the showstoppers: cinematic elemental attacks that are usually ranged. There\u2019s a skill tree to unlock upgraded spells, as well as more attack options. Some of the earth spells can deal consistent damage, like magical machine guns, while others will deal charged-up burst damage, or even create an earthen shield that will counter some physical attacks. Each one seems to have a use case.</p><p>When you\u2019re facing a particularly tough foe, effective use of your spells will build up a special surge magic meter. Once that\u2019s full, you can unleash a devastating attack that can hit (and hopefully kill) multiple enemies.</p><figure><img alt=\"Forspoken preview\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/2a08a410-7703-11ed-97f7-a7a1aa0d0933\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Square Enix</div></figure><p>While some support skills are set-and-forget, like a flower \u2018turret\u2019, others require a bit more strategy. You can hit an enemy with a slow-burn seed attack to gradually seep their strength, which is useful on slower, high-defense enemies. A leech attack will lash out in a wide arc, returning health depending on how much damage it does. If you use it against multiple enemies, you\u2019ll get more in return. These all come with a cooldown compared to the attack skills, so you\u2019ll have to use them all strategically. (My timing and skill definitely improved as I played the game.)</p><p><em>Forspoken</em> will even grade your battles, like <em>Devil May Cry </em>or<em> Bayonetta</em>. At the start of my preview demo, with limited skill (and options) I struggled to get beyond C-rank fights but in moments near the end of my demo, I\u2019d somehow claim \u2018star\u2019 rankings \u2013 the top grade. These ranks take into account how long fights took, the amount of damage taken, damage dished out and the creative range of attacks used. You\u2019ll get bonus points for a surprise attack, among other things. If I just gunned enemies down from afar, it was not going to get a good grade. Skilled play is rewarded by bigger loot payouts and even an experience point boost, making leveling up (and upgrading) even quicker.</p><p>As you might expect from an action RPG, there are all kinds of ways to strengthen Frey. Beyond leveling up and expanding the spell repertoire, there are equipment slots for both a necklace accessory and cloak. These can both be upgraded once you find the right resources and also customized with boons to improve health, defense and attack. I was able to even automate healing with one accessory I found during my playthrough. I could also customize Frey\u2019s nails to beef up certain spell families, helping magic to recharge faster or simply deal more damage.</p><p>Around the same time as Frey learns she can hurl boulders and summon vines, she\u2019s also gifted with magical parkour skills, which are a mix of parkour, wall climbing and ice skating. This really helps get across the vast landscape at a fair clip \u2013 it\u2019s like having a horse without, well, having a horse. <em>Forspoken</em> tries to make the most of the PS5\u2019s DualSense, too \u2013 Sony has a two-year exclusive with Luminous Productions\u2019 first game. As I magically skated and jumped around, the controller subtly vibrated; when Cuff had a quip about my battle skill (or lack of), they spoke out of the DualSense speaker. The most satisfying part was the force feedback on the triggers as I charged up spells, especially if they were the big, explosive ones.</p><p>These traversal skills are sewn into the fights, too. While dodging can be a little too forgiving \u2013 Frey will sometimes arc and leap off air to avoid attacks ad infinitum\u2013 combining magical dodges and dashes with earth spells and vine attacks will amp up the power of some of Frey\u2019s moves. Timing, however, is crucial.</p><p>The battle system did throw up some difficulty spikes. At one point, before facing off with the aforementioned sorceress Sila, I found myself being repeatedly humbled (and killed) by a herd of demon goats. Was I under-leveled? Possibly. Did I lack accessories and equipment upgrades? Definitely. But it was a choke point where the fights seemed suddenly harder than everything that came before it (including a few boss fights). In fact, it was harder for me than the eventual showdown with the Tanta of Strength, Sila.</p><p>The lock-on system seemed a little temperamental (often an issue when it\u2019s assigned to the L3 or R3 stick buttons), and while many attacks can affect multiple enemies at once, the system leans toward one-on-one fighting \u2013 otherwise a lot of target-switching. This was still an early build of the game, however. There\u2019s time for this to be finessed \u2013 something that\u2019s also true of a few graphical glitches, like invisible spell effects and missing objects during a few cutscenes.</p><section><img alt=\"Forspoken preview\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/29862da0-7703-11ed-b6be-bb8cef45dead\" /></section><p>While groups were often an issue, the controls come together well in the bigger battles. Once I\u2019d made it to the throne of the fire, sword and fiery sword-wielding Sila, I had to swap around my spells and keep my distance. Sila could soak up plenty of damage and was incredibly lethal up close. Once Frey was able to whittle down her health enough, she was joined by a platoon of her soldiers (ugh, a group battle) and went through another two \u2018levels\u2019 of fury. Without giving everything away, eventually, Frey\u2019s left in a fiery battleground, trying to dodge molten floors and sword attacks while flinging her own earth spells and trying to restrain the raging boss with vine sorcery. It felt like the right balance of skill and cinematic magical warfare \u2013 and fun. Sila comes across as an off-kilter monster, making it easy to want to beat her.</p><p>Eventually, I prevailed and received the fire-based spells of Sila for myself, creating an entirely new skill tree of spells and charms centered around strength (buffs) and, of course, fire. If Frey is going to pick up several more skill trees from the other three Tantas, knowingly referenced in wall paintings ahead of that confrontation, that\u2019s going to mean a lot of spells and a lot of upgrades. While I didn\u2019t get a chance to mix up my new fire spells with earth at this demo, I wonder if there might be <em>too</em> many. There\u2019s a reason Square Enix has uploaded extensive videos on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-forspoken-magical-parkour-spells-rpg-140017421.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...\"><em>Forspoken\u2019s </em>magic system</a>, even if it whets the appetite with huge lightning strikes and giant explosive orbs of water. But how will all these tricks interplay? Do we really need so many spells? We\u2019ll have to wait to see \u2014 and you can now test out a few of Frey's tricks yourself in the free demo, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-forspoken-demo-ps5t-130053708.html\">available now. </a></p><p><em>Forspoken</em> launches January 24th 2023 on PC and PS5.</p><p></p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-buds-and-smart-home-devices-low-prices-134748438.html?src=rss", "title": "Google's Pixel and Nest smart home devices are back at Black Friday prices", "date_published": "2022-12-12 13:47:48+00:00", "description": "<p>If you have any regrets about pass on Google Pixel smartphone deals during this year's Black Friday sales, worry not.
