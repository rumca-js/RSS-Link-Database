It’s introducing a system called Linked Roles, where admins and moderators can grant people access to certain channels and even entire servers based on which third-party apps and websites those people have connected to their Discord account.</p>
<p id="Y9YfvU">In <a href="https://discord.com/blog/connected-accounts-functionality-boost-linked-roles">an extremely detailed blog post on Monday</a>, the company says the feature, which will be rolling out over the next few weeks, will support connecting accounts from sites like Steam, Twitter, Reddit, DeviantArt, and more (there are “over twenty official Connections,” according to Discord’s blog post).

  <p id="ePmfMl">The hit comedy podcast <em>How Did This Get Made? </em>is sticking with Earwolf. Paul Scheer, June Diane Raphael, and Jason Mantzoukas, who host the show about terrible movies, have signed a multiyear deal to remain with the SiriusXM-owned podcast studio.

  <p id="Q8NMH6">WhatsApp’s “View Once” feature, which currently lets you send photos and videos that disappear after the recipient has viewed them, may soon also support standard text-based messages. <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-22-25-20-whats-new/"><em>WABetaInfo </em>reports</a> that it found evidence of the in-development feature in the latest beta version of WhatsApp’s Android app, which might one day let users send messages that are only viewable once before disappearing into the ether. </p>
<p id="30N9jb">Much like the current “View Once” feature, the new functionality could one day be useful for sending sensitive information that you don’t want a recipient to have ongoing access to, like a password or credit card details.
