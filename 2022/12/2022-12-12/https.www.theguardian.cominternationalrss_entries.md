<p>Yet again, this show has proved that it is possible to make outstanding TV that both plays to the crowd and refuses to sing the classics. What a glorious way to see off the year</p><p>There can be a tendency for television shows – particularly popular, much discussed, endlessly meme-ed ones – to hedge their bets in order to protect the franchise. Often, when a drama becomes a bona fide hit, it is less likely to plump for a definitive ending. Wanting to preserve the magic for another season, it ekes it out just enough to satisfy while dangling a carrot for the next go around. It’s safe to say that The White Lotus (Sky Atlantic) has no such qualms about choosing a side.</p><p>What an ending this was. It wrapped up its storylines with decreasing levels of subtlety, from Albie being “played” by Lucia, moving through the resilience of Daphne’s determined denial, ramping all the way up to Tanya the destroyer, and ultimately the destroyed. Did you see it coming? Tanya was always in danger – “These gays! They’re trying to murder me!” – but it was a chef’s kiss to have her almost get away, having shot her way through her enemies, only to be undone by her own poor aim, and possibly the fact that she didn’t take off her heels before jumping.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/12/the-white-lotus-finale-review-an-absolute-televisual-chefs-kiss">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Morocco goalkeeper’s career could have followed a very different trajectory but for a timely VAR intervention</p><p>Video Assistant Referee Changed My Life. It’s not the most likely headline, but in Yassine “Bono” Bounou’s case it’s true. “Everyone is talking about him now,” Julen Lopetegui says. Two years ago, the Wolves and former Sevilla manager knows, plenty were talking about him too, just not for the right reason. Luckily, every now and then the VAR does something that suggests it’s not completely awful, and this was one of those times. That night, it rescued the man who has ended up rescuing Morocco, en route to making World Cup history.</p><p>It was February 2020, the Europa League round of 32. With a minute remaining against Cluj a fairly tame shot slipped under Bono’s body and into the net. Sevilla were out and so, in all probability, was he. Signed on loan from Girona, Bono was back up to Tomas Vaclik. He had played just 45 minutes in the league and two Copa del Rey games against fourth-tier opposition. The Europa League was his competition and, amidst whistles and tension, that had gone. So had he: that option to buy wouldn’t be taken up now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/12/sliding-doors-moment-has-taken-bono-to-the-brink-of-world-cup-immortality">Continue reading...</a>

## Lawrence of Arabia at 60: a dazzling spectacle with complexity under the sand

<p>David Lean’s epic is still an astonishing visual achievement but there’s far richer and darker themes at play</p><p>Growing up in the 90s as a young child who was really into film, I was told two things about Lawrence of Arabia by my elders, usually in tandem. First, that it was A Truly Great Film, indisputably so, even among the Greatest Ever Made. And second, that despite its urgent and inarguable Greatness, I wasn’t to rush to see it – not until I had an opportunity to do so in a cinema. It wasn’t even worth watching on a television screen, they said, for that would cut its brilliance in half, or worse: like having your first glass of champagne and mixing it with water.</p><p>And so I waited. In Johannesburg, where I lived, there was no such thing as repertory cinema: my first experience of seeing a “classic” on the big screen was a 20th-anniversary re-release of Grease. Eventually, my patience ran out: when I noticed a late-night airing of David Lean’s horizon-wide historical drama on the TV schedule, I junked the advice I had hitherto been given, and stayed up to watch it on our boxy 14in Sony. I have no doubt that it was unfortunately cropped, letterboxing rarely being the favoured broadcast option in that dinkier age of television sets. But I don’t really remember, largely because, with all those caveats and warnings in mind, I was enthralled by the film anyway.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/12/lawrence-of-arabia-1962-movie">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>13 October 1940 – 24 September 2022</strong><br />The musician salutes the long career of the fellow saxophonist, the master of spiritual, ‘cosmic’ jazz who was ‘like a third grandfather’ to him</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/dec/12/obituaries-2022-cherry-valentine-remembered-by-bimini">Cherry Valentine remembered by Bimini</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/the-observers-obituaries-of-2022">Read the Observer’s obituaries of 2022 in full</a></li></ul><p>When I was eight or nine, my father took me to see Pharoah Sanders in a little bitty club. I remember it was fun being out at night, but I also remember how powerful the music was, and how I feel I’ve always recognised his very unique sound on his saxophone. It’s like something from the cosmos: raspy, but super-soulful and pure, at times very beautiful, almost sweet, but he also adds lots of details like growls, without it ever sounding harsh. And his skill was beyond any type of technical comprehension. He could play something bluesy and spiritual, then just move into these incredible flurries of notes, like he was suddenly flying through clouds of supernova dust.</p><p>My dad, a big jazz fan, made sure that I kind of understood where Pharoah’s music came from. I knew how he was once homeless, how Sun Ra gave him a place to stay, and how he became such a huge part of John Coltrane’s band. Losing Coltrane so young [of cancer, at 40, in 1967] must have been like losing the sun in the sky. But you can hear a difference in John Coltrane as well when Pharoah started playing with him. Anyone who was around Pharoah as a musician can’t have failed but be influenced.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/12/obituaries-2022-pharoah-sanders-remembered-by-kamasi-washington">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Forever Living Originals)<br /></strong>The Mercury winner’s surprise-release album finds her going in on mental health and the music industry, in a deep collaboration with Sault’s Inflo</p><p>There are umpteen reasons why an artist might choose to suddenly release a new album with little in the way of advance promotion or even warning.

Earlier this year, she parted company with her manager of seven years. It isn’t entirely clear if a lot of the more pointed lyrics on No Thank You are aimed at him, but it certainly sounds like they might be: “Why did I give you the keys to authorise shit on my behalf? What did I expect from those living the corporate life?” she asks at one point. Meanwhile, in April, she cancelled a prospective US tour. She cited financial reasons, but added: “I’m just not able to put myself through this mental stress.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/12/little-simz-no-thank-you-review-righteous-anger-and-restless-experiments">Continue reading...</a>

Harry Maguire’s booking on Saturday was the only yellow England picked up in their five games in Qatar, and the respectful manner in which they accepted their defeat to France will have added to their case. By contrast, the Argentina v Netherlands quarter-final the day before produced a World Cup record of 18 yellow cards for players and coaching staff.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/12/strange-unfair-history-world-cup-fair-play-award-england-japan-qatar">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Most venomous creatures store their poison in a gland. Not the stingray, whose venom is in its very tissue</p><p>Where do you begin with an animal whose mouth looks like a face, whose face is split into two – half at the top, and half the bottom; who can breathe with either part – from spiracles behind the eyes, or gills behind the mouth; whose teeth are scales; whose scales are teeth-like (denticles)?</p><p>When stingrays hunt, they lose sight of their prey – their eyes are bad, and their prey is often underneath them. To find and feel clams, mussels, crabs and fish, the rays rely on electroreceptors in their skin, or, as National Geographic puts it, “<a href="https://www.natgeokids.com/uk/discover/animals/sea-life/stingray-facts/">special gel-filled pits</a>”. They literally inhale their food, gulping down the electric signal. As they do this, they breathe through the spiracles behind their eyes, which work less efficiently than their gills.

Possibly of equal interest are the historical gobbets spread throughout, documenting key moments in the progress of the women’s game in the UK – thwarted by the FA, overshadowed by the men’s game, undermined by everyday sexism – which digs up some fascinating archive footage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/12/lionesses-how-football-came-home-review-a-cheer-for-englands-winning-women">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Touted as a cure for environmental and physical ills, the organic movement is falling short of high expectations</p><p>After 10 years of slow but steady growth, sales of organic food and drink in UK supermarkets have fallen by 2.1% over the last year. More sobering still is that despite a decade of boasts about strong year-on-year growth, organics started from such a low base that it still only accounts for 1.8% of the total food and drink market, compared to 1.2% a decade ago. So even if this year’s dip is a blip, a o.6% gain in market share each decade would mean it would be another 800 years before most of what we ate and drank was organic. Even with exponential growth of 50% per decade, we’d still have to wait until the 22nd century.</p><p>The movement is facing other important challenges. Few other than true believers think that we can sustainably feed the world organically. There is broad consensus that on average organic yields are around 80% that of “conventional” crops. More organic farming would require more good farmland, which is in short supply. Worse, researchers who examined the consequences of the UK going fully organic concluded it would increase greenhouse gas emissions and reduce biodiversity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/12/the-big-idea-has-organic-food-passed-its-sell-by-date">Continue reading...</a>

Diop’s film is only a debut if you’re happy to disregard documentary as a lesser branch of cinema that somehow doesn’t count; as her first dramatic feature, Saint Omer merely extends the clear-eyed gaze and burning social interest of her non-fiction work into new narrative terrain, with nary a tremor of uncertainty. Films like We showed Diop has form in braiding truth, storytelling and intense human scrutiny; Saint Omer isn’t so very different.</p><p>The surprise is that Diop’s entry into fiction takes the form of a courtroom drama, among the most rigidly procedural and rule-bound genres in the medium – only to strip it of its expected structures and rhythms, centring disordered interior feeling amid unyielding legal process. The case, drawn from a real-life 2016 headline-maker in France, is stark and horrifying: legally straightforward, perhaps, but psychologically tumultuous. Young Senegalese Frenchwoman Laurence Coly (Guslagie Malanda, often scarcely moving a muscle while giving one of the year’s most mesmerising performances) is accused of murdering her infant daughter. She doesn’t deny the act, but claims sorcery was to blame, sticking calmly to her story over days of frustrating testimony – shot by Claire Mathon with penetrating stillness, allowing the viewer to take in her micro-shifts in expression and intonation, her consistency of comportment, her occasionally lofty turns of phrase, as she repeats her awful confession over and over.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/12/saint-omer-alice-diop-best-movies-2022">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Clothing is one of the most powerful tools we have’: Finnegan Shepard brings proper fit to trans men

<p>Knowing how tricky shopping for a wardrobe can be, the fashion entrepreneur started his own line for trans men</p><p>Finnegan Shepard, who is trans, underwent top surgery in April 2020. During the healing process, he began searching for a swimsuit in which he could proudly show off his new masculine chest. But the options he came across online were less than satisfactory. “Everything was really Pride-branded or super-functional, [and made it look] like I wanted to go rock climbing,” says Shepard, who lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and was, until 2018, a graduate student focusing on political philosophy and creative writing. The swim trunks he had in mind were stylish and flattering, with extra room built in through the seat and thighs.</p><p>The idea for a clothing line expressly made for trans masculine bodies began to germinate. Shepard set up informational interviews with members of the trans community, questioning his contacts about their relationship with clothes to figure out what they wanted and needed in a clothing line. “I started with the three trans people I knew, and then asked them to introduce me to any trans people they knew,” Shepard, 30, says of the process that quickly ballooned into countless interviews.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/12/both-fashion-line-trans-men-finnegan-shepard">Continue reading...</a>

## Divisive 30x30 protected areas target struggles to win trust at Cop15

<p>The target is dominating at the biodiversity summit, but the problem of finding a balance between Indigenous peoples’ rights and conservation remains unresolved</p><p>Just as the climate conference focuses on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/30/giving-up-on-15c-climate-target-would-be-gift-to-carbon-boosters-says-iea-head">1.5C</a>, the UN biodiversity conference appears to have found its north star – protecting 30% of land and sea by 2030. From the moment delegates landed at Montréal-Trudeau airport, adverts at the baggage carousel were frank about Canada’s aims for Cop15: achieving 30x30, the tagline for the proposal. The perceived success of the overall conference hangs on this single target, say those who support it.</p><p>The science is clear that humanity must better protect key parts of the planet. The destruction of forests and other vital ecosystems must stop by 2030 if the world is to meet 1.5C, <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/">according to the IPCC</a>. But 30x30 is actually just one of more than 20 targets being agreed at the Cop15 biodiversity conference in Montreal, and it also happens to be one of the most divisive issues on the agenda. Everyone at the summit has an opinion about the most high-profile target and what it should mean: for some it is not ambitious enough, for others it is impossible to enforce, but the main criticism is that area-based conservation violates human rights.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/12/plan-to-protect-30-of-earth-divides-and-inspires-at-cop15">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Manchester United show their derby mettle, Arsenal learn from last season’s slump and Jelena Cankovic arrives at Chelsea</p><p>Despite failing to take three points from a Manchester derby at the sixth time of asking, Manchester United’s 1-1 draw at City carried with it plenty of positives. “I think there was a change in this game,” the United manager, Marc Skinner, said. “We’re frustrated with the result but not the performance.” In past meetings United have struggled but on Sunday they came to the Etihad and, in front of 44,259 people, well and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/11/manchester-city-united-womens-super-league-wsl-match-report">truly took the game to City</a>. Skinner said the difference this time was that his players had “come off not feeling like they’ve had to defend for their lives like they perhaps did sometimes last season”. This was a close-to full strength City side too, albeit with five new signings in the starting XI, only making United’s performance all the more impressive. <strong>SW</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/12/womens-super-league-wsl-weekend-talking-points">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Freezing temperatures linked to weak polar vortex in the stratosphere, with cold weather expected to remain until next week</p><p></p><p>The current cold spell in Europe will persist this week as high pressure continues to stagnate over western Russia. The cold weather is linked to a weak, split polar vortex in the stratosphere, which allowed high pressure to build across Greenland last week. This in turn led to Arctic air flooding south across the UK on northerly winds. The polar vortex is due to strengthen eventually helping to end the cold spell with low pressure to the west of the UK becoming dominant.</p><p>Much of western and central Europe, including the UK, will stay consistently around 5C below typical values for this time of year, with many places struggling to rise above freezing even during the daytime. Change is on the horizon, however, as low pressure systems begin to encroach into Europe towards the weekend. Latest forecasts show temperatures in western Europe returning to average by the start of next week, though central and northern Europe will see extreme cold persisting a little longer. In contrast, Spain, which has experienced a record-breaking warm and dry autumn, will finally see some recognisably wintry temperatures.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2022/dec/12/weather-tracker-what-is-behind-europe-cold-spell">Continue reading...</a>

Suzushiro (voiced by Soma Saito) is a troubled boy who after a traumatic time at high school has arrived in Tokyo on a journalism scholarship; this is at an unspecified future time after some “great catastrophe”. (Perhaps most will think of Covid: I sense that is not what is being indicated.) He is supplementing his income by doing a glorified paper round, made more difficult because he has to collect subscription payments door-to-door.</p><p>During one of the inevitable bad-tempered arguments with a customer Suzushiro discovers his superpower: he can stop time, an ability triggered by his own intense anger or unhappiness, and which is accompanied by a sick, short-of-breath feeling. He walks among the statue-still people as if through a poison cloud. He senses that this terrible power is connected with his unresolved anguish at a tragic event that marked the end of his school career, about which he is still in denial. Stopping time is a kind of parable for his desperate wish to stop the train of consequences from that time which have followed him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/12/eternal-831-review-anime-thriller-superpower-kenji-kamiyama">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>2 March 1931 - 30 August 2022</strong><br />The former Soviet leader’s longtime interpreter remembers an optimist who wanted to achieve his goals by persuasion, not force, and knew that he was a man of history</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/11/obituaries-2022-sidney-poitier-remembered-by-sydney-tamiia-poitier">Sidney Poitier remembered by Sydney Tamiia Poitier</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/the-observers-obituaries-of-2022">Read the Observer’s obituaries of 2022 in full</a></li></ul><p>It’s become a kind of a stereotype that Mikhail Gorbachev was wildly popular in the west, and totally unpopular in Russia. It is more complicated than that. When he died, huge numbers of people wanted to say farewell to him at the Hall of Columns in the centre of Moscow. The state organisers of the funeral had told us we shouldn’t allocate too much time for the farewell. But thousands upon thousands of people did come. Gorbachev’s daughter, Irina, said that she would sit in that big hall, where he was lying in state, as long as people still wanted to come. She was there for many hours.</p><p>I started working as Gorbachev’s translator when I was 36, in 1985. I was with him through all the negotiations on ending the cold war and the nuclear arms race. But the real friendship between us started after he had stepped down in 1991 and I continued as his translator and adviser for international and media relations. He didn’t travel with a huge retinue of people. So for nearly 30 years I was involved in just about everything, from checking in at the hotel, to meetings with US presidents and the British prime ministers. I witnessed him, too, as a husband and a father and grandfather at the heart of their wonderful family. And I saw him practically every day in the office, until his health began to decline. Even until the end of last year, he was still active from his hospital room, responding to requests for articles, reactions to events.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/12/obituaries-2022-mikhail-gorbachev-remembered-by-pavel-palazhchenko">Continue reading...</a>

She steps up to the challenge of having nowhere to hide, and there is a resolve here that gives the impression of an artist firmly and confidently finding her feet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/12/the-50-best-albums-of-2022-no-10-nilufer-yanya-painless">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a normal year there are around three fatalities from dog attacks; this year there have been nine. What has happened – and can anything be done? </p><p>On a normal morning on a normal walk to school in Ramsgate, east Kent, Sophie and her three children saw their neighbour and his dog on the street and stopped to chat. “The kids pet the dog, everything’s normally fine,” she says. “And it all seemed fine the day it happened – there were no warning signs. I said: ‘Right, come on, we’ve got to get to school because we’re going to end up being late.’” Her seven-year-old son, Louis, gave the dog – a St Bernard and Japanese akita cross – one last stroke on its back, then the dog turned around, sank its jaws into his face and pinned him to the floor.</p><p>She and the owner grabbed the dog. Her other two children ran off in panic, a man came running out of a nearby business with a first-aid kit thinking there had been a car accident because of all the screaming, and Sophie held her son’s face to her chest to try to stop the bleeding. A paramedic car arrived and took Louis to a nearby park, from where he was airlifted to hospital, and into surgery. The dog, says Sophie, “had punctured straight through his top lip, and through his gums. It went through one side of his nostril.” On the other side, Louis had a 5cm laceration along his jaw. “The surgeon said if the dog had got him a little lower, we would have lost him. It was right next to his jugular.” Louis’s skin was pieced back together, and has healed well, says Sophie, although there is scarring. “It’s a constant reminder whenever you look at him.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/12/lockdown-bad-breeds-or-just-poor-training-why-are-dog-bites-on-the-rise-in-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My attempts have been somewhat chaotic with water going up my nose, but I’m all for getting big eighties hair</p><p><strong>The hack<br /></strong>Could inverting your hair wash create the hair volume you’ve been craving? </p><p><strong>The test<br /></strong>My hair is super fine, so anything to give it some volume is welcome, especially if it’s free. The method for this hack is simple: you just flip your hair upside down in the shower while you’re washing your hair with shampoo and conditioner. Do learn from my mistakes though: my first try resulted in water everywhere particularly up my nose. My second try was the handheld shower instead – which is vital, I now realise – and resulted in slightly less chaotic wash. I then blow-dried it, waiting for any signs of tangible volume. But like that time aged five when I believed I was getting a puppy but was presented with a Sylvanian Family toy instead – I was noticeably disappointed with the result. I tried this hack again, but then blasted my roots upside down until it was 80% dry before returning to finish the rest upright. The latter produced more volume at the roots, the wash itself was unnecessary.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/12/can-washing-your-hair-upside-down-give-it-more-volume">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Belgian dance-theatre company love to create unnerving environments – and are set to put the apocalypse on stage. They talk about their taboo-trouncing shows</p><p>Knock, knock. Who’s there? In <a href="https://www.peepingtom.be/en/home/#r">Peeping Tom</a>’s suspenseful shows you can never be sure. The Belgium-based dance-theatre company builds atmospheric and often bewildering stage architecture. The Missing Door, The Lost Room and The Hidden Floor – a triptych they are taking <a href="https://www.peepingtom.be/en/tour-dates/">to the UK</a> – open up noirish worlds of intrigue, illusions and lugubrious comedy. These walls not only have ears but full-blown personalities; the closets don’t have skeletons but whole bodies; look in one of their mirrors and the face you see won’t be yours.</p><p>The triptych is an intense night out, opening with a maid mopping up blood and ending with nothing less than the apocalypse. But co-artistic director Franck Chartier, wearing a goatee and a big grin, is in a breezy mood when he arrives on his scooter to meet for morning coffee in Ostend. It’s more than 20 years since he founded the company with his partner, Gabriela Carrizo. Where did that name come from? “We are always a bit like this as creators,” he says, leaning over conspiratorially. “We look at people,” he continues, casting an eye at the unsuspecting couple next to us in the cafe. “We watch how people eat, who they are, we get ideas. We look for situations in real life and in our families. We talk about taboos. We thought, ‘OK, we are kind of peeping toms.’” He looks a little uneasy. “I don’t know – in English, it has a sexual connotation?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/dec/12/peeping-tom-dance-theatre-interview-franck-chartier">Continue reading...</a>

In 2017, Swiss biophysicist Jacques Dubochet won the Nobel prize in chemistry – jointly with Richard Henderson of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge and Joachim Frank of Columbia in New York – for his work on cryo-electron microscopy, freezing biomolecules in mid-movement and so rendering them visible for the first time; this was a great leap forward for pharmacy and medicine.</p><p>The snowy-haired Dubochet, who did his important work at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg before returning to Lausanne, is shown to be at first bemused and a little flustered by the hordes of excitable photographers who descend on his tranquil campus, clamouring for interviews and demanding a soundbite explanation of his work for the TV news. But Dubochet is no innocent: he was a committed anti-nuclear campaigner in Germany in the “Atomkraft? Nein Danke” era of the 80s, and the film shows it dawning on Dubochet that he can use his new platform to campaign on the new issue that he’s passionate about – the climate crisis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/12/citizen-nobel-review-chemistry-prize-winner-becomes-charismatic-climate-crusader">Continue reading...</a>

I switched off my limited critical faculties and surrendered to a fondue-gooey viewing experience. It has a sketchy plot, damp-squib sexual chemistry and supporting characters limited to one personality trait, as if rationed. Then there’s the loopy premise: the leads share a flat and a bed (one gets it during the day, the other at night) without meeting. Fine by me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/12/flatmates-are-disgusting-what-would-it-take-to-fall-in-love-with-one">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From ‘lepak’ to ‘deurmekaar’, terms borrowed from its 1.75 billion global speakers are enriching the language we share</p><p>Who owns the English language? The answer to this question is no longer as straightforward as “the English”.

Counted among this vast anglophone population are not only the hundreds of millions who speak English as a first <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/language">language</a>, but also the hundreds of millions more who speak it as a second or foreign language in different parts of the world.</p><p>English spread across the globe largely as a result of imperialism, as the language was imposed on colonies in Asia, Africa, Australia and the Americas. When these former colonies achieved independence, many chose to retain the use of English, usually to function as a primary working language and neutral medium of communication for their diverse populations. As countries such as India, Nigeria, South Africa, Jamaica and Singapore adopted English as a language, they also adapted it – making significant changes to its pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary, and giving rise to new varieties now collectively known as World Englishes.</p><p>Danica Salazar is a lexicographer at Oxford Languages, where she leads editorial projects on world varieties of English</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/12/english-words-world-global-speakers-language">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After years of his erotica being turned into podcast gold, the mysterious author of Belinda Blinked finally broke his silence – with a wild interview. Here are the highlights</p><p>In September 2015, a show with a rather unlikely title and slightly naff red logo appeared. For those not adept at reading titles, the premise of My Dad Wrote A Porno was that Jamie Morton would read aloud from his father’s self-published erotic novel, Belinda Blinked, and discuss it with his old university pals, Alice Levine and James Cooper. Over the next eight years and seven seasons, the filth juggernaut has rolled across the globe, picking up celebrity fans in the form of Emma Thompson, Daniel Radcliffe, Jon Ronson and many more. Throughout all of its absolutely wild plot twists – the blue semen, the vaginal smoke and spirals in the mud – its author has remained shrouded in mystery. Until now.
