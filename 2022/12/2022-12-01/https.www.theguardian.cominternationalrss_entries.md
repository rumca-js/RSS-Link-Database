<p>The truth is Romelu Lukaku probably should have departed the pitch cradling the match ball but the painful reality is the striker left empty-handed, his hat-trick of second-half misses condemning Belgium to a damning and premature World Cup exit. The worst one of all came deep into stoppage time. Thierry Henry covered his eyes with his top. Thomas Meunier chucked a water bottle into the ground. Yannick Carrasco threw a towel over his face. At the final whistle Lukaku punched the perspex substitutes’ bench in frustration before being consoled by Youri Tielemans.</p><p>Toby Alderweireld, one of those who surely won’t return to this stage, lay on the turf.

She gave every impression of being unfailingly modest and understated while playing a vital role in one of the most successful rock bands in history, maintaining a remarkably clear-eyed view of their strengths and failings: she bluntly dismissed the last two albums she made with the band, 1990’s Behind the Mask and 1995’s Time, as “terrible”. She appeared to sail through the soap opera that was Fleetwood Mac in the mid- to late 70s – a broiling mass of failed personal relationships, cocaine-fulled egotism and excess – with such a degree of equanimity that Nicks took to calling her Mother Earth. Somehow, she pulled off the not-inconsiderable feat of seeming to be at one remove from the band’s madness while in reality being in the thick of it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/01/mother-earth-musical-prodigy-or-steely-powerhouse-the-enigma-of-christine-mcvie">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Wigmore Hall, London<br /></strong>A rogue hearing-aid forced a restart to the pianist’s survey of Schubert sonatas, but once things settled, Lewis confirmed what a superlative interpreter he is of these works</p><p>S<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/30/schubert-where-to-start-with-his-music">chubert</a> has been one of the mainstays of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/paul-lewis-pianist">Paul Lewis</a>’s repertory since the beginning of his career. His cycle of the Schubert piano sonatas in the early 2000s, in concert and on recordings, played a major part in establishing him as one of the leading British pianists of his generation, and those works have been regularly included in his recitals ever since. Lewis is now returning to the sonatas in earnest once again, with a plan to survey them across the next two years in four programmes that he is touring internationally.</p><p>At the Wigmore Hall, the first of those recitals began rather unfortunately, when the howls of an audience member’s hearing aid gone feral, only silenced after repeated pleas from the hall’s director, forced Lewis to restart the sonata with which he opened, the E flat, D568. Perhaps as a result the performance never quite seemed to settle; in a work that often sounds more like Mozart or early Beethoven than Schubert, and which in any case is a revision of an earlier sonata in D flat, textures often seemed cloudy and cluttered, its classical outlines obscured.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/01/paul-lewis-review-pianist-schubert-wigmore-hall-london">Continue reading...</a>

They had lost their final group match <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/30/poland-argentina-world-cup-group-c-match-report">2-0 against Argentina</a> but had survived a Lionel Messi penalty and 23 shots, including one cleared off the line in stoppage time, and progressed to the last 16 by virtue of having collected two yellow cards fewer than Mexico. Or at least that’s what they thought when the final whistle went.</p><p>As it turned out, a 95th-minute <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/30/saudi-arabia-mexico-world-cup-group-c-match-report">goal for Saudi Arabia</a>, scored 25km north at the exact moment that Messi and Robert Lewandowski were embracing post-game, covering their mouths to exchange words, would mean that Poland progressed on goal difference. But 2-0 down against Argentina at Stadium 974 while Mexico were leading by the same score at Lusail, the two teams tied on everything in Group C, the lifeline they had clung on to was fair play.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/01/dont-get-cards-how-polands-strange-world-cup-progression-played-out">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Fantasy)<br /></strong>No one expected these songs of off-key melancholy, imperfect singing and seasonal disappointment to succeed, but nearly 60 years on, the jazz pianist’s masterpiece endures</p><p>Vince Guaraldi’s career, or rather the legacy of his career, is a curious thing. His name is absent from the index of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/15/1016020385/re-revising-the-history-of-jazz">Ted Gioia</a>’s authoritative The History of Jazz. Nor was it mentioned, even in passing, during the 19 hours of Ken Burns’ documentary series Jazz. When the great jazz critic <a href="https://jazztimes.com/features/columns/vince-guaraldi-that-joyous-thing/">Nat Hentoff</a> belatedly wrote an essay about him in 2010 – 34 years after Guaraldi’s sudden death, aged 47 – it was in the context of rediscovering a lost figure, noting that Guaraldi had never been on the list of nominees for the Jazz Hall of Fame, and comparing him to the largely forgotten swing-era trombonist Jack Jenney.</p><p>Like Jenney, Guaraldi died young, and, like Jenney, he played with a succession of names more likely to crop up in jazz history books and documentaries than his own: in Guaraldi’s case, Stan Getz, Ben Webster and Woody Herman. But that is where the similarities end. Guaraldi’s early death notwithstanding, his career is hardly a case of what-ifs. He was an expansive, even boundary-breaking artist: around the time <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/miles-davis">Miles Davis</a> was attempting to widen his audience by sharing bills with Neil Young and appearing at the 1970 Isle of Wight festival, Guaraldi was up on stage in San Francisco, jamming with Jerry Garcia; he also had a fair claim to be the artist who did the most to introduce young audiences to jazz during the 60s and 70s. He saw – and continues to see – vast commercial success: 1962’s Cast Your Fate to the Wind was, alongside Dave Brubeck’s Take Five, one of the few jazz hits of the era; 1965’s A Charlie Brown Christmas is one of the bestselling jazz albums of all time, alongside Miles Davis’s Kind of Blue.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/01/vince-guaraldi-trio-a-charlie-brown-christmas-super-deluxe-edition-review-a-festive-classic">Continue reading...</a>

## Fanny and Alexander review – Ingmar Bergman’s dark fusion of Shakespeare and Dickens

<p>In a three-hour, 40th anniversary rerelease, this Swedish family saga unfolds with emotional power, wonder and brilliant acting</p><p>Ingmar Bergman’s mysterious and terrifying family drama has a realist structure shaken by tremors of supernatural revelation; it is now rereleased for its 40th anniversary in its three-hour theatrical cut (as opposed to the aggregate five hours of Bergman’s originally intended television version). This is maybe Bergman’s most personal film, inspired by a childhood dominated by his formidable and forbidding Lutheran minister father, Erik. Bergman had an older brother and a younger sister, novelist Margareta Bergman, and I wonder if Margareta ever wondered at how very unimportant “Fanny” actually is in this film: an irrelevance that the title misrepresents.</p><p>Fanny and Alexander is a brilliant – in fact maybe unique – fusion of Shakespeare and Dickens, with some Chekhov in an uncle’s morose musings on his own failure and mediocrity and also some Strindberg – “that nasty misogynist” as the grandmother sharply calls him when asked by her daughter to produce his A Dream Play at the family theatre.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/01/fanny-and-alexander-review-ingmar-bergmans-dark-fusion-of-shakespeare-and-dickens">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Don’t Stop, Everywhere, Little Lies – the late singer-songwriter, who has died aged 79, was responsible for some of the soft-rock canon’s greatest hits</p><p>Before she was Fleetwood Mac’s Christine McVie, she was solo artist Christine Perfect – a rock’n’roll moniker if there ever was one. Her self-titled 1970 LP (later cheekily retitled The Legendary Christine Perfect Album) features a handful of originals and select covers. Among the highlights is a lovelorn take on 1967’s I’d Rather Go Blind, a hit for both Etta James and McVie’s late 60s band Chicken Shack. McVie ruminates on a broken heart, her velvety voice sounding wistful next to hymn-like organ and reverent horns. However, the brave facade cracks, and her voice rises with despair upon mention of her beloved’s affection, revealing hidden regret.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/01/christine-mcvie-her-10-greatest-recordings-with-fleetwood-mac-and-solo">Continue reading...</a>

The broadcaster TF1 cut to an advert break after Griezmann’s shot deep into stoppage time crossed the line, believing the final whistle had sounded in the aftermath, and prompting millions of viewers to switch off.</p><p>Instead the referee, Matthew Conger, was belatedly called to consult the pitchside monitor by VAR and contentiously ruled out the late strike because of Griezmann’s offside position earlier in play.

<ul><li>Hosts declare on 598-4 with West Indies 74-0 in reply</li><li>Former captain also reaches Bradman mark of 29 tons</li></ul><p>It is a matter of some amusement that Marnus Labuschagne could make a Test double century and still end up as part of a Steve Smith day. So it goes playing alongside somebody whose career is already part legend. Australia’s number three reached the milestone first, taking 204 runs from the West Indies at Perth before finally nicking the part-time spin of Kraigg Braithwaite in the last over before lunch on the second day. But Smith took over the match as his canvas, moving from 114 to an even 200 not out, one ball before Brathwaite bowled Travis Head on 99 and Australia declared on 598 for four. West Indies were 74 for none at the close.</p><p>Labuschagne had been indefatigable in the limelight after his first day, happily doing a series of boundary-line interviews, a long press conference, and backing up with more interviews at throwdowns the following morning on an unusually cool and cloudy Perth day. Resuming on 154, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/30/old-firm-of-labuschagne-and-smith-put-australia-in-control-against-west-indies">with Australia 293 for two</a>, he had the energy to help Smith with an all-run four in the first over. He had luck when miscuing Kyle Mayers and Jason Holder, he got through Alzarri Joseph, and he saw too much middling spin from Roston Chase while young quick Jayden Seales was barely seen. Whether it was the recent milestone or the impending break, Labuschagne lost concentration for just long enough to end his extended stay. The score was 402 for three, the partnership 251.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/01/smith-and-labuschagne-rack-up-double-centuries-on-milestone-day-for-australia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There’s zero personality to the leads, the plot’s full of holes and it’s utterly unrealistic. But this romcom about a couple who fall in love while timesharing an apartment is oddly irresistible</p><p>I knew The Flatshare (Paramount+) was going to be unrealistic when, in the opening scenes, Tiffany moves into her new rented flat and almost immediately bangs a picture hook into the wall. This, I thought, is a woman who has never had to deal with an estate agent’s punitive charges. The flat turns out not to be Tiffany’s, at least not entirely: this is an adaptation of the 2019 novel by Beth O’Leary, and follows an untraditional flatsharing arrangement. Tiffany has the flat from 8pm to 8am and at weekends; she has entered into an agreement with Leon, a night nurse trying to earn extra money for what obviously turns out to be extremely big-hearted reasons, who gets his own flat from 8am to 8pm, and stays with his annoying girlfriend at weekends.</p><p>Tiffany immediately starts leaving her pesky lady things everywhere: candles, floral cushions and herbal teabags. After a frosty start and some misunderstandings about tidiness, etiquette and whether you should move into another person’s flat and hang a huge vagina painting on the wall, Tiffany and Leon begin to communicate flirtatiously, via Post-it notes. It’s basically Love Is Blind, without the pressure to get married, but with the pressure of Leon’s brother Richie being imprisoned for an armed robbery he didn’t commit and Tiffany somehow managing to get involved in that, while also quibbling over the quality of the shared loo roll.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/01/the-flatshare-review-this-cheesefest-is-as-maddeningly-watchable-as-emily-in-paris">Continue reading...</a>

As with other, relatively new descriptors – primarily “toxic” and “boundaries” – accusations of gaslighting are a quick and effective way to end any discussion, since denial of gaslighting is the primary signifier of gaslighting. Set and match!</p><p>Credit where it’s due: we have Donald Trump to thank for this state of affairs, and such is his hubris it would be entirely in keeping with the man to claim as victory the fact that a term popularised to describe his appalling behaviour was this week unveiled by Merriam-Webster, the dictionary publisher, as its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/28/gaslighting-word-of-year-2022-merriam-webster-dictionary">word of the year</a>.

<p>Downey Jr starred in Robert Downey Sr’s wacky counterculture movies as an child; now he puts this radical and potent personality in a documentary of his own</p><p>“It all looks sweetly narcissistic,” says veteran underground and indie film-maker Robert Downey Sr at one stage in this documentary about him, produced by and prominently featuring his movie star son Robert Downey Jr. That’s a fair comment on the whole proceedings, but there is definitely something sweet, sad and affectionate about this home-movie portrait, which Downey Jr began as an open-ended project in 2019 as his dad was beginning to submit to Parkinson’s in his 80s.</p><p>The idea – which maybe always existed more in theory than practice – was that they would be co-creating it, with Downey Sr working on his own alternative edit.

<p>England needed to ‘play better with the ball in the attacking third’, according to team captain Harry Kane. But what on earth does that mean?</p><p>I started out in journalism presenting programmes about financial matters. I tried to take this often complicated subject matter and make it as simple as possible. When I moved into presenting football on television, it often felt as if we were endeavouring to do the opposite – take something as simple as football and make it as complicated as possible. Don’t get me wrong: the analysis of the best ex-footballers in the business, as long as they use the most accessible language, can be fascinating. My favourite to work with was the former Arsenal and England player Lee Dixon. To make sure what he was saying was intelligible, he used to run it past me first. He called me, very few might say unkindly, his idiot filter. But I was very proud to perform this function for him because I was very good at it.</p><p>Working Lunch was the business programme I co-presented with Adam Shaw, who was as expert on matters financial as Lee was on football. And, like Lee, Adam used me as a bit of an idiot filter, too. Interestingly, Adam used to say of football that he’d like to be more into it but found a lot of the language around it baffling. This made him feel excluded, as if he was a guest at the wrong party.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/01/football-jargon-game-england-harry-kane">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pearce impresses as a writer drawn out of tragedy-imposed hiding in an atmospheric thriller that ultimately blows hot air</p><p>This atmospheric thriller stars the always compelling Guy Pearce as recluse Bruce Cogburn, a gruff novelist living alone with only his north of England accent for company. (The accent has no relevance to or effect on the story, but Pearce has cultivated it so lovingly for the film it practically feels like a supporting character.) Cogburn lives alone because back in the 1980s, he wrote a novel called The Infernal Machine, a fable-like story about a priest who meets God. Somehow, Cogburn’s book inspired a young man named Dwight Tufford (played by Alex Pettyfer), who he’d never met, to climb a clock tower and kill people with a rifle, like mass murderer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/campus-carry-texas-law-ut-tower-massacre-anniversary">Charles Whitman</a> back in 1966.</p><p>Now, in the film’s present 25 years later (which would place the action some time in the early 00s), Cogburn starts receiving handwritten letters from someone called William DuKent. DuKent is also an author who seemingly wants to write a book about The Infernal Machine, Tufford and Cogburn, and asks the latter for his cooperation. At first, via messages left on an answering machine that form entertaining mini-monologues for Pearce to play the character in various states of sobriety, Cogburn politely refuses, and then grows more insistent that DuKent should leave off. But DuKent’s efforts to reach Cogburn become more elaborate and aggressive, prompting Cogburn to start becoming actively paranoid as the situation grows increasingly strange.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/01/the-infernal-machine-review-guy-pearces-reclusive-novelist-dials-up-the-paranoia">Continue reading...</a>

## Violent Night review – David Harbour is a bad Santa in a bad movie

<p>The Stranger Things star plays a foul-mouthed Santa in a gory battle with criminals but he’s let down by an unfunny script</p><p>Between Die Hard and Home Alone, fending off intruders in a single location has become a Christmas tradition on par with downing a few eggnogs and arguing about tax reform with older relatives. The new action picture Violent Night, which invokes both aforementioned films by name as well as with constant all-caps homage, fits its seasonal siege into the post-John Wick beat-em-up mold co-originated by producer David Leitch. This could and should and sometimes manages to be a felicitous pairing of genre with gimmick, a novelty of theme proving vital to prolonging any winning formula. And just as Gene Kelly or Jackie Chan continuously innovated fresh shtick by incorporating unexpected props and environments into their high-physicality routines, so too does the rough-hewn Santa Claus (David Harbour) leading the counteroffensive get some good mileage out of the arsenal of decorative bric-a-brac at his disposal.</p><p>Not to be a Scrooge, but the occasional eye-gouge with a tree-topper star or string-light garotte only lends a frosty air of resourcefulness to a film with coal for brains. Any cleverness stops with its improvised weaponry, the sufficiently brutal smackdowns wedged in a half-baked plot like so many chunks of candied apricot in an underdone fruitcake. Beneath the coagulated layer of maroon blood, this merry massacre wants to share in the goodwill toward men of the yuletide fare not courting an R rating, as it reacquaints an embittered Santa with the Christmas spirit and a deadbeat dad with the importance of family. Between the perfunctory sentimentality tacked on to the final act and the sophomoric yuks out of the Deadpool Book of Bad Words, however, there’s not a lot to thank St Nick for this year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/01/violent-night-review-david-harbour-bad-santa">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Smith brings movie-star presence to historical figure whose suffering and dignity became an iconic abolitionist image</p><p>Whatever his current travails, Will Smith brings a movie-star presence to this brutally violent civil war drama, with a physical stillness and defiantly steady gaze. It is inspired by the true story of “Whipped Peter”, the escaped slave who in 1863, having enlisted at a Union military camp in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, showed his horrendously scarred back to two civilian photographers there, shockingly disfigured with a lattice of raised welts and whip marks. The resulting photograph became an iconic abolitionist image: evidence of the savagery and Peter’s own heroic dignity and calm.</p><p>Smith’s Peter is not shown being whipped in this way, but it is clear that, like all the enslaved people, he has been subject to systematic cruelty, a type of racist violence that is not a distinct punitive event, but a continuous fact of life, a condition of existence. The violence is embedded in the language used as the owners have an ugly way of referring to the slaves as “it”. The movie imagines Peter to be married to Dodienne (a fierce performance from Charmaine Bingwa), with whom he speaks French dialect, but is separated from his wife and children when he is bought by another owner and put brutally to work on the south’s railroad and military fortifications. Like most of the film, this chaotic camp is shot in a bleached-out near monochrome, with flashes of flame picked out in colour: a visual approach perhaps borrowed from Schindler’s List.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/01/emancipation-review-will-smith-flees-slavery-in-fierce-sombre-thriller">Continue reading...</a>
