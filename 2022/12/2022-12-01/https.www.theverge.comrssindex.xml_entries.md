  <p id="HybV0B">A video doorbell is a high-tech upgrade for your front door, adding visual voicemail to your doorstep and a heads-up to who’s there on your smartphone or smart display. Another fun and little-known feature of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22954554/best-video-doorbell-camera">smart doorbells</a> is the option to change up the doorbell’s ringtone.</p>
<p id="8hJZhG">Depending on the model, you can change the sound the doorbell itself makes or the sound the electronic chime inside your house makes. For example, Nest video doorbells can use different tones at the front door, but Ring and Arlo doorbells only change the sound of the compatible digital chimes inside your house. </p>

  <p id="r97R6p">When a number that is obviously spam hits your phone, Android will almost always warn you and allow you to immediately block that number (and report it as spam). But what if a number is not immediately recognized as spam? Or what if you’re dealing with a harasser who won’t stop calling? You can still block the number quickly and easily.</p>

On Tuesday and Wednesday, petitioners filed briefs in <em>Gonzalez v. Google </em>and <em>Twitter v. Taamneh</em>, a pair of lawsuits blaming platforms for facilitating Islamic State attacks.

  <p id="qySQMJ">The European Union has taken a major step toward legitimizing attempts to pull carbon dioxide out of the air. Yesterday, the European Commission adopted a proposal for new rules on how to certify carbon removal, a still controversial strategy for limiting climate change.</p>
<p id="acy5dx">The worry is that, without the proposed rules, ineffective carbon removal projects might derail climate goals and give polluters a sham to hide behind while presenting themselves as green. So, to weed out such projects, the European Commission wants to establish a framework for certifying “high-quality” carbon removals.</p>
<p id="6wAOJ0">“Higher transparency will ensure trust from stakeholders and industry, and prevent greenwashing,” the Commission said in its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7156">announcement</a>.</p>

  <p id="XrZARf">Summer Game Fest is back again in 2023 with its first-ever in-person kickoff show on June 8th, which just so happens to be a few days before E3’s big return. </p>
<p id="wVyX1m">For the past three years, Summer Game Fest has served as the gaming industry’s big June blowout while E3 has been in flux due to the pandemic. E3 hasn’t happened as a big in-person event for quite a while; it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21163570/e3-canceled-coronavirus-outbreak-xbox-nintendo">canceled in 2020</a>, held as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22531138/e3-2021-summer-game-fest-news-announcements">a series of remote events in 2021</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/31/23005138/e3-2022-online-virtual-event-canceled-covid-19">canceled again in 2022</a>. In its place, Summer Game Fest became one of the biggest virtual events of the June gaming season.

  <p id="ioOFNd">The first thing that you should know about <em>The Eternal Daughter,</em> the latest film from director Joanna Hogg, is that it’s not as spooky <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23434610/tilda-swinton-the-eternal-daughter-trailer-a24-hogg">as the trailer makes it seem</a>. It is indeed a ghost story, one with some unsettling moments and themes, but the scariest thing about the movie is its frighteningly realistic depiction of familial relationships and how they can be damaged by grief. The second thing you should know is that Tilda Swinton plays her own mother, and she’s incredible.</p>
<p id="dPM3qk">The film appears to be set in the same semi-autobiographical universe as Hogg’s <em>The Souvenir </em>films and centers on a daughter and her elderly mother as they visit a quaint Welsh hotel. (Both characters are played by Swinton.) It’s the kind of old building that has...</p>

  <p id="fthkK7">At a ‘show and tell’ event on Wednesday, Elon Musk said<strong> </strong>that his brain-computer interface company, Neuralink, could implant one of its devices in someone’s head within the next six months — meaning it’s not happening this year. He also claimed that he would get the device implanted in his own head at some point in the future. </p>
<p id="zYeeIr">During the presentation, Musk said that the company had submitted most of the paperwork needed for a human clinical trial to the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates medical devices in the United States. Previously, Musk had said that he’d hoped for human trials to begin in 2020, and then 2022. Now, that’s slipped to at least 2023. </p>

## Anker’s Eufy lied to us about the security of its security cameras

  <p id="jxbxdc">Anker has built a remarkable reputation for quality over the past decade, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769839/anker-battery-charger-gan-amazon-apple-mfi-lightning-iphone-magsafe-decoder">building its phone charger business into an empire</a> spanning all sorts of portable electronics — including the Eufy home security cameras we’ve recommended over the years. Eufy’s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.eufy.com%2Fpages%2Fprivacy-commitment&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F11%2F30%2F23486753%2Fanker-eufy-security-camera-cloud-private-encryption-authentication-storage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">commitment to privacy</a> is remarkable: it promises your data will be stored locally, that it “never leaves the safety of your home,” that its footage only gets transmitted with “end-to-end” military-grade encryption, and that it will only send that footage “straight to your phone.”</p>
<p id="Lq7nkx">So you can imagine our surprise to learn you can stream video from a Eufy camera, from the other side of the country, with no encryption at all. </p>
