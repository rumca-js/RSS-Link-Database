But if your main goal is to look cool, the Shield of the Guilty has you covered. In this brief guide, we'll tell you how you can score it during your playthrough of the game.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Shield of the Guilty explained</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">The Shield of the Guilty is a small shield that requires 8 Strength to wield. It makes a poor choice for protection, but you can use it to parry or toss an Ash of War on it to give you some useful skills. Thanks to its briars, it even makes a decent attacking shield.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-where-to-get-the-shield-of-the-guilty/1100-6505194/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-trailer-breakdown/2900-4491/", "title": "Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny Trailer Breakdown", "date_published": "2022-12-01 22:45:00+00:00", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4070584-untitled-1.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Indiana Jones is back, and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-trailer-totally-whips/1100-6509648/\">the first trailer looks exceptionally good</a>. Harrison Ford returns as the archeologist who doesn't mind punching the bad guys for his fifth film, and this time around, he has a few new friends. But what exactly is going on in the first trailer for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Arriving in theaters on June 30, 2023,James Mangold (Logan) will helm the project and serve as co-writer, alongside John-Henry Butterworth and Jez Butterworth.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sharing the screen with Ford is a slew of well-known names that include Phoebe Waller-Bridge (Fleabag), Mads Mikkelsen (Hannibal), Boyd Holbrook (Logan), Toby Jones (Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy), Antonio Banderas (Uncharted), and Thomas Kretschmann (King Kong).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While Steven Spielberg is not directing, he will be serving as a producer, and joining him are Simon Emanuel, Frank Marshall, and Kathleen Kennedy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Now, going through the trailer, which clocks in at one minute and 43 seconds, there is a lot to take in, but one thing is for sure, this feels like classic Indiana Jones. So we're taking a look to see what's going on and what this movie is all about. Check it out below.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>A good chase</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4070585-2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>It wouldn't be an Indiana Jones movie without something exciting on a vehicle. Whether it's Jones fighting a nazi on a tank or Jones fighting a member of the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword on a boat, there's bound to be something. In Dial of Destiny, we're getting treated to a scene of Jones jumping from one tuck tuck to another. Because of the writing on the automobile above, this is likely taking place in an Arabic country.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Always the teacher</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4070586-3.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Jones continues to teach in lecture halls. He's gotten older, but he's still trying to inspire the next generation of potential archeologists. Here, there's an image on the overhead projector. Could this be the fabled Dial of Destiny? Probably not, as it looks like some sort of container.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Old friends</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4070587-4.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Throughout Indy's adventures, he's made a lot of friends along the way--and just as many enemies. And Jones tells a man in a fez--wait for it--that his adventurous days have come and gone.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>John Rhys-Davies is back!</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4070588-5.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Sallah is here to tell Jones that perhaps his days of wild adventures aren't over. Rhys-Davies appeared as the character in both Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. He's also known for his role as Gimli in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and Professor Maximilian Arturo in the TV series Sliders.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Back on an adventure</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4070589-6.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>We see an older Jones back on an adventure, looking at a statue, with snakes adorning its armor. Why did it have to be snakes? Seriously though, if this adventure is snake-heavy, Jones is going to regret this.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Young Jones is back</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4070590-7.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>It was recently revealed that there will be some <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-5-will-turn-back-the-clock-on-harrison-ford-with-de-aging-technology/1100-6509335/\">de-aging in this movie</a> for Ford. This will be for a scene in the opening of the film that takes place in 1944. Here's your first look at it, and it looks pretty good.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>First look at Antonio Banderas</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4070591-8.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Revealed more than a year and a half ago, Banderas was set to co-star in Dial of Destiny. Here's our first look at him--a man who apparently can play the banjo. It's unclear at this time how Banderas will fit into the film.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mads Mikkelsen in uniform</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4070592-9.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>While details about who <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mads-mikkelsen-joins-cast-of-indiana-jones-5/1100-6490198/\">Mads Mikkelsen is playing in Indy 5</a> were unknown, it's pretty obvious from the couple seconds of footage we see that he's playing a nazi, and his character's name is Voller. However, according to a recent interview with <a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/indiana-jones-5-nazis-1969-exclusive\">Empire</a>, his character is inspired by Wernher von Braun, a nazi who became a NASA engineer. Voller wants to correct mistakes from his past and make the world a better place. Considering the movie takes place in 1969, there will probably be a connection to the moon landing--there's a parade later in the trailer which could be celebrating it.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Dial</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4070593-10.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Briefly, we see what is most likely the Dial of Destiny. Since a few of the ideas and concepts from Indiana Jones lore are based in myth and lore, we looked into the Dial of Destiny, and all we could find was a fiction book written in 1911 by Frederick Luther Koontz, and that doesn't seem to be connected to this new movie.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ancient traps and puzzles</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4070594-11.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge joins the cast as Indy's god daughter, Helena.

During the first day of CCXP, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guardians-of-the-galaxy-volume-3-gets-emotional-first-trailer/1100-6509651/\">we got a surprise teaser trailer drop for the movie</a>, and despite it being just under two minutes long, it managed to pack in a ton of clues and details about what we might expect--as well as some new and exciting additions to the MCU at large.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Guardians Vol. 3 will focus on a few major plot points for our ragtag heroes. First, there's the hunt for Gamora, who was time-displaced after the events of Endgame and has none of the memories of the Gamora who fell in love with Peter. She bailed after Thanos was taken care of and has been, presumably, running around space ever since. Peter's goal has been to search for her, though he did take a detour for some adventures with Thor as we saw in Love and Thunder.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Next, there's the issue of Rocket's past, which is something Gunn has teased about this installment for a while. We're going to be getting a look at where Rocket came from, and it looks pretty sad--also, we'll get to meet some other sentient animals along the way, including Cosmo the Space Dog.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, there are some villains in the mix. There's the High Evolutionary, who's part in all of this remains relatively unknown and also Adam Warlock, who might not stay a villain forever. It's pretty difficult to tell with a guy like Adam, especially considering the fact that it seems like he's going to be given an extensive MCU makeover.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 hits theaters May 5, 2023.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. New looks</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4070583-hed.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Quill and the Guardians have upgraded their street clothes to fully fledged uniforms that match and everything\u2013a first for the Guardians as we know them in the MCU. These outfits are clearly inspired by the comics, though we have no idea where they come from or why they were chosen in the world of the movie.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Baby Rocket</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4070578-2.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Gunn has already spoken about the focus of the movie on Rocket's origins and history and we get to see plenty of that in the trailer, including a very ominous shot of him as a little baby, back when he was just a normal, non-talking raccoon.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Gamora</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4070579-3.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Gamora's situation is complicated. Don't forget that this isn't the Gamora who grew and changed alongside her friends through Volumes 1 and 2. This is a Gamora who was displaced in time from when she was still loyal to Thanos. She bailed at the end of Endgame and we have no idea what she's been up to since.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Hey look, Cosmo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4070580-4.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Cosmo the Space Dog will be joining the crew this time around--and while we're not sure what circumstances bring them all together, we do know that they'll be voiced by Maria Bakalova of Borat fame.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. The High Evolutionary</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4070582-6.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>We got confirmation at SDCC this year that the main villain of Guardians 3 would be the High Evolutionary, played by Chukwudi Iwuji, who crashed the panel in costume to pontificate about the necessities of evolution for disgusting lower life forms. We get some quick shots of him here, doing experiments.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Lylla the Otter</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4070581-5.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Blink and you might miss it but there's a quick shot of Rocket reuniting with his soul mate, Lylla the sentient otter. In the comics, she's the heir of a toy making empire on an alien plant. No, really. We have no idea what her deal is in the MCU, though.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Warlock</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4070595-7.png\" /><br /><h3><p> We get our first good look at Will Poulter's Adam Warlock here, in all his golden glory. In the comics, Adam Warlock is an artificially created god-like being with a history that could be described as \"complicated\" at best and \"a mess\" at worst. In the MCU, however, it looks like he's being relatively streamlined down and will be used as a weapon created by the Sovereign (remember those gold guys from the other Guardians' movies?) to destroy the team.</p></h3></p><br />", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guardians-of-the-galaxy-volume-3-gets-emotional-first-trailer/1100-6509651/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 Gets Emotional First Trailer", "date_published": "2022-12-01 22:24:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Marvel has released the first trailer for the final film in James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy.

While Pokemon Sword and Shield had areas where players could run around together, the entire region of Paldea can be explored in up to four-player co-op. Though you have the option to play with your friends throughout the entire game, not everything works fully in co-op. Here's everything you need to know about co-op in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">How to get into a co-op session</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">The ability to get into a co-op session, referred to in-game as a Union Circle, is unlocked very early in the game, as soon as you reach the first Pokemon Center. While it unlocks this early, there are limitations on what you can do at this point in the game, so it's best to get through the early hours of the game and get set loose into the world first. To set up a Union Circle, head to a Pokemon Center and interact with the yellow kiosk or open the menu and head to the Poke Portal. From here, you choose Union Circle and can either set up a lobby or join one. Access to the lobby will be restricted by a four digit code. <strong>Make sure you are playing in online mode before trying to set up a Union Circle.</strong></p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Activities designed for co-op</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">The primary appeal of playing co-op is playing the Tera Raids together. These raids can be found across Paldea, offering up Pokemon with unique Tera Types. These raids have to be done with four players--although the game will fill your lobby with bots if necessary--so having your friends with you can speed up the process of finding a full lobby. These raids also offer extra rewards, like EXP items and valuable items that can be sold.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-co-op-and-union-circle-explained/1100-6509634/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-holiday-sweater-available-now-for-75/1100-6509633/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Xbox Game Pass Holiday Sweater Available Now For $75", "date_published": "2022-12-01 18:55:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Just in time for the festive season, Microsoft has begun selling an Xbox Game Pass-branded holiday sweater, one that Microsoft promises \"has a soft feel and is not itchy.\"</p><p>The $75 sweater features wintry graphics and a snowman in the middle whose head is made out of green snow with the Xbox Game Pass logo on it.

This movie represents the first time characters from the Beast Wars arm of the Transformers franchise have been brought to live-action, as well as a new cadre of villains (the Terrorcons, this time, rather than the Predacons you might expect from the Beast Wars cartoons, or the Decepticons from the classic Transformers stories). Oh, and there are some human characters too but let's be honest, no one is here for them.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The trailer, despite being under three minutes long and giving away next to nothing of the plot, actually showcases ten individual robots in disguise\u2013and maybe even more than we missed. They're very good at hiding, after all. That's kind of their whole thing.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Rise of the Beasts is technically a sequel to 2018's Bumblebee, we're not actually sure how the two will connect to one another. Hailee Steinfeld's Charlie is not featured in the trailer at all. Instead, Anthony Ramos is the main human character, playing Noah, who seems to be teaming up the most with Mirage\u2013though he's none-too-happy about that fact at first. We similarly can't be sure just how the Maximals arrived on Earth, or what they've been doing all this time. In the Beast Wars cartoons, the Maximals and Predacons exist on a \"mysterious\" Earth-like planet that is almost definitely ancient Earth, completely devoid of humans.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Rise of the Beasts will roll out into theaters in June of 2023.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Optimus Primal</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4070451-tfhed.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Our fearless Maximal leader, Optimus Primal, gets a starring role in the new trailer showcasing his live-action redesign which, surprisingly, looks pretty close to his cartoon self. He's huge, a bit more robotic than a regular gorilla, but still definitely himself.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Optimus Prime</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4070442-2.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Good ol' OP, voiced yet again by Peter Cullen, is back for this movie and ready to be everyone's robot dad.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bumblebee</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4070443-3.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Bumblebee has become the sort of de facto mascot for the live-action Transformers franchise, a status which was solidified with his solo movie. He's back in this movie, looking just like we last saw him\u2013though Hailee Steinfeld's Charlie Watson is still MIA.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mirage</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4070444-4.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Technically a new-comer to the live-action world (we're not counting his appearance as \"Dino\" in Age of Extinction) is Mirage, seen here as a classic Porsche with illusionary powers that are very similar to his abilities from the cartoons and comics.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Cheetor</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4070445-5%5D.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The hip, young kid of the Maximal team, Cheetor has been a fan favorite for the Beast Wars generation since he debuted. We see his live-action re-design here as a giant cheetah--probably not the best for blending in on Earth, but it does look cool.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Airazor</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4070446-6.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Another beloved Maximal, Airazor is only seen for a split-second in falcon form in the trailer, shooting a laser at a bridge.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Arcee</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4070447-7.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Arcee has found a lot more success in the cartoons than she ever did in her brief stint as an unrecognizable side character in Michael Bay's movies. She's been given a do-over for this one, though, looking much more like herself.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Scourge(?)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4070448-8.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>The villains of the movie are kept isolated in very quick and dark shots, making them much harder to pick out than our heroes. The Terrorcon fighting Bumblebee here is likely the live-action redesign of Scourge, their leader. He'll be voiced by Peter Dinklage.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Rhinox</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4070449-9.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Optimus Primal's stalwart right-hand-robot, Rhinox, is briefly seen in rhino form.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Battletrap</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4070450-10.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>While yes, there is technically a G1 Transformer named Battletrap, it looks like the one in the movie is getting a full-on reimagining. He's possibly inspired by the G1 Terrorcon Sinnertwin (or Twinstrike)--but it's very hard to tell, considering how little we see of him.</p></h3></p><br />", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rocket-league-explodes-into-winter-with-season-9s-fire-and-ice-goodies/1100-6509636/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Rocket League Explodes Into Winter With Season 9's Fire and Ice Goodies", "date_published": "2022-12-01 18:43:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Season 9 in Rocket League will introduce a new Rocket Pass, a fire and ice variant of the Forbidden Temple arena, and the return of Frosty Fest and Neon Nights.</p><p>A new car headlines this season's Rocket Pass: the Emperor, which has a Breakout hitbox.

The series follows a devil hunter who can turn into a hybrid beast with chainsaws on his arms, and one coming out of his face.

Known for her work in Black Clover and Dragon Ball Super, she's no stranger to voicing characters in various anime, but Chainsaw Man still found ways to surprise her. \"I thought the Bat Devil coming to her and requesting that she do the dirty work for the Bat Devil was really interesting and strange,\" she told GameSpot, referencing Episode 3 of the anime. Power isn't a traditional devil hunter--but what is traditional, anyway? She's a fiend, which is a devil that's taken over a dead body. More specifically, it's the Blood Devil that's taken over this body.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Why would a devil make another devil do this? How? What is their motive? What would bring them to do such a thing? And then that devil eats her after eating her cat. The fact that he just straight up ate her and he's like, 'You know what? That blood was disgusting. I ate her too, even though she's nasty.' This Bat Devil's so strange.

The latest target is the lack of voice acting in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-scarlet-pokemon-violet/\">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</a>, as a group of actors have put together a dub video in order to demonstrate the potential impact of spoken dialogue.</p><div>          </div><p dir=\"ltr\">The video breaks down several aspects of the Pokemon experience, starting from the cutscene where the player is prompted to choose their favorite starter.

Altogether, the voice actors involved definitely make a difference in the overall presentation.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Project coordinator Dr. Bonehead states in the video's description that they feel that Pokemon's upcoming Generation 10 should feature dialogue. Several YouTube comments agree, with fans noting that the game's emotional story beats would've hit harder with a fully voiced cast. Over the years, Nintendo has been slow to add voice acting to some of its core franchises, most notably the Legend of Zelda series. 2016's seminal entry <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/\">Breath of the Wild</a> was the first to include <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-why-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-has-voice-actin/1100-6441126/\">full voice acting</a> in cutscenes, though Link himself remained largely silent.

A <em>lot </em>happened this year, so much so that anyone could be forgiven for forgetting some of the year's biggest gaming news. In this gallery we're looking back at 2022's biggest news stories, including Microsoft's proposed bid to buy Activision Blizzard, E3 being canceled (and then resurrected), developers pushing to form labor unions, and more.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And the news isn\u2019t stopping just yet! The big-time The Game Awards showcase takes place on December 8, and we\u2019re expecting a good amount of big news to come out of that show.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">2022 was also a year marked by a series of major gaming acquisitions, and you can read more in GameSpot's rundown of 2022's biggest gaming buyouts in the days ahead.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Big Buyouts</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4069742-screenshot2022-11-30at10.58.46am.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">2022 was a year dominated by mergers and acquisitions in the video game industry. In fact, some estimates and projections said 2022 was on pace to become the biggest year on record for major buyouts, with deals totalling more than $150 billion in 2022. Some of the biggest deals in 2022 included Take-Two buying Zynga for $12.7 billion, Microsoft announcing a bid to purchase Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion, Sony buying Bungie for $3.6 billion, and The New York Times buying the viral word game Wordle for a seven-figure fee.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Embracer also made a series of buyouts in 2022, including Dark House, Square Enix franchises like Deus Ex and Tomb Raider, The Lord of the Rings series, and more. More recently, however, Embracer acknowledged that the world is facing tough economic times of late and might need to spin off some of its companies and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-world-is-getting-worse-and-heres-how-it-could-affect-one-major-game-company/1100-6509234/\">take advantage of certain tax rules</a> to help weather the storm.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There were so many big gaming buyouts in 2022 that we're collecting them for a separate gallery that you can read the days ahead.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Game Developers Rally Support For Ukraine</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4069743-ukraine.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">A global tragedy kicked off the year in February when Russia invaded Ukraine, sparking a war that has left <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/10/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-casualties-deaths.html\">hundreds of thousands dead</a>, according to experts.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In response to the invasion by Putin and his military forces, companies like EA, CD Projekt, Epic, Activision Blizzard, and more stopped selling their games in Russia, while many game studios donated funds and contributed to charitable causes to support those affected by the war.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">One major developer based in Ukraine, GSC Game World, delayed Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl, due to the impact of the war on its developers. At least one developer at GSC Game World fought against Russian forces and was killed. This terrible tragedy is ongoing.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Steam Deck Releases</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4069744-deck.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Valve's handheld gaming device, the Steam Deck, was officially released in February. We said in our review that the Steam Deck is a \"wonderfully constructed and powerful portable PC\u2026\" The system excels at being a mobile hub for your Steam games, and if you're looking to make the most out of your PC catalog on the go, Steam Deck is the best option right now.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Elden Ring Makes A Splash</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1593/15930215/3549373-screen%20shot%202019-06-17%20at%2011.17.09%20am.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Elden Ring, the latest game from Bloodborne and Dark Souls studio From Software, arrived at the end of February and quickly became a critical and commercial success. The game was adored by critics and sold like hot cakes, pacing up to 18 million and counting so far.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In fact, Elden Ring is expected to be 2022's best-selling game in the US, even outpacing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II. Despite Elden Ring's massive success, From Software and publisher Bandai Namco have not announced any expansion or sequel plans, at least not yet.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Goodbye, E3; Hello, E3</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4069745-e3.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">In March, the Entertainment Software Association officially canceled E3 2022. There would be no in-person or virtual event this year. The ESA previously said E3 would not have an in-person component in 2022 due to the pandemic, but this announcement meant there would be no digital element either. The ESA did, however, confirm that E3 would return to Los Angeles in 2023 for its first in-person event since 2019.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Good news for fans of E3 came in September when it was announced that PAX organizer ReedPop would be taking over E3 and bringing the show back in June 2023. ReedPop is planning to resurrect the show at the same site, the Los Angeles Convention Center, with a digital component as well for people who aren't looking to attend in person. It's still early days, but E3 2023 is now officially on the books for June 13-16, 2023, so buckle up.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>EA And FIFA Break Up</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4069746-fifa.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Another big story in 2022 was EA and FIFA ending their decades-long relationship for soccer video games. FIFA was reportedly asking for a massive fee of $1 billion for EA to continue using the FIFA name, and the gaming publisher opted to simply walk away.</p><p>The series will continue, of course, but it will be called EA Sports FC beginning in 2023. EA already holds separate licensing agreements with thousands of players, teams, leagues, and more, so EA claims losing the FIFA name won't be all that important in terms of representation for The Beautiful Game. Time will tell.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Game Developers Seek To Unionize</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4069747-nintendo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike other major entertainment businesses like TV and film, the video game industry is largely not unionized. In 2022, a number of developer groups pushed for collective bargaining, including Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty studio Raven Software.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A team of BioWare QA developers also took steps to unionize. Workers at Nintendo also attempted to unionize, and this led to a lot of drama and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/09/29/nintendo-tester-union-busting-whistleblower\">one developer claiming union-busting from Nintendo.</a> It remains to be seen if these unions will be officially recognized, and if so, what impact that could have on the labor market in the video game industry.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Game Developers React To Roe v. Wade Decision</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4069749-roevwade.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The United States Supreme Court handed down a major decision in June when it announced it would overturn the landmark federal Roe v.

The company had been laying the groundwork for some time, and it reached new levels in 2022 with the launch of Netflix Games for mobile. Subscribers have access to a growing catalog of mobile titles they can download and launch from directly within the Netflix app.</p><p>And in a nice, welcome change from the wider mobile games market, Netflix\u2019s video games have no microtransactions or ads. Not only is Netflix hosting mobile games, it\u2019s now developing them, too. Netflix has six internal game development studios currently, one of which is staffing up to create what sounds like a big-budget PC AAA game. It remains to be seen if Netflix will eventually get into streaming games, but it seems like a natural step for the company that dominates the wider streaming media landscape.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Consoles Are Easier To Find (Thankfully)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4069751-ps5.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>In 2022, the market for new consoles\u2013namely, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S\u2013improved significantly. Shoppers were more reliably able to walk into a store or place an order online for a new-generation console compared to 2021, which was marked with serious shortages that caused a lot of frustration.</p><p>Microsoft and Sony have been able to better keep up with demand for their newest Xbox and PlayStation consoles, and Nintendo continued to keep pace as its Switch console outperforms both of them in terms of total sales.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>PS5 Price Hike</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4069752-pricehike.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>While the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles were relatively easier to find in 2022, the good news was balanced out by some less-than-ideal news this year when Sony announced it was raising the price of the PlayStation 5 in dozens of regions around the world.</p><p>The US was spared from a price hike, but shoppers in Canada, Europe, the UK, Australia, and other places are now paying more due to the global economic environment that is driving up production costs.</p><p>Microsoft will follow suit with its own Xbox price hikes in 2023, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has said, though the executive has yet to say if it will be hardware, software, subscriptions, or another element of the Xbox business that will see price increases next year.

It's the end of the year and you've survived to see it through to the end. December is typically a relaxed month when it comes to video game releases, but this year has a few high-profile games looking to take advantage of that annual lull in activity. We've rounded up thee biggest games of December 2022 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Whether you're looking for something for yourself or are trying to find a gift for the gamer in your life, December's schedule has a number of notable games that could be of interest.</p><p>One such notable example is The Callisto Protocol, a terrifying sci-fi horror that might be the perfect palette-cleanser for anyone fed up with all the festive season jolliness and endless loops of Mariah Carey tracks on the radio.</p><p>On the same day The Callisto Protocol arrives, two other big games hit store shelves: Marvel's Midnight Suns and Need for Speed Unbound. Midnight Suns will likely appeal to fans of tactical-RPGs, while Unbound marks the return of one of the best-known racing franchises.</p><p>December will also feature entries in the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest franchises as well as the follow-up to one of the best Nintendo Switch exclusives. Check out December's game release highlights below.
