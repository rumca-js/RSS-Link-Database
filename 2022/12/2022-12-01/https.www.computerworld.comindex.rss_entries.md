<p>As digital technologies have transformed the way people create, move, and store their data over the decades, managing the multitude of physical documents and digital data produced by a company has remained an ongoing challenge for businesses. Technologies such as cloud-based apps and services, along with regulatory requirements around the storage and protection of customer data, have required companies to explore technology solutions for document and data management.</p><p>In earlier days, this meant investing in a <em>document management system (DMS)</em>, which helped companies digitally store and manage paper-based and online documents. The rise of web-based technologies created <em>content management systems (CMSes)</em>, which managed digitally created content, but also included formats such as audio, video, images, and HTML-based files.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3680556/how-enterprise-content-management-is-evolving-from-monolith-to-modular.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

The most embarrassing experience was being fired from my first full-time job as a dish washer in an unairconditioned kitchen. But I was a kid then and living at home. Later, when I was fired after a forced takeover of the business I worked at, I was living paycheck to paycheck — and went into a panic that led to a lot of really poor career decisions focused more on getting any job rather than rethinking my career.</p><p>Since then, I’ve covered a lot of layoffs — and were it to happen to me again, I’d approach the problem differently.
