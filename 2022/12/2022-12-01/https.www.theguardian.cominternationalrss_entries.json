He saw \u2013 and continues to see \u2013 vast commercial success: 1962\u2019s Cast Your Fate to the Wind was, alongside Dave Brubeck\u2019s Take Five, one of the few jazz hits of the era; 1965\u2019s A Charlie Brown Christmas is one of the bestselling jazz albums of all time, alongside Miles Davis\u2019s Kind of Blue.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/01/vince-guaraldi-trio-a-charlie-brown-christmas-super-deluxe-edition-review-a-festive-classic\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2022/dec/01/england-behind-the-scenes-world-cup-qatar-in-pictures", "title": "England behind the scenes at the World Cup \u2013 in pictures", "date_published": "2022-12-01 11:52:58+00:00", "description": "<p>As England gear up for Sunday\u2019s last-16 tie against Senegal, we look at what Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad are doing to relax in between games.

How will you fare?</p><p>December is here and it will be magic again. It is the traditional season where the Thursday quiz cannot decide whether to go all-in for Christmas silliness, or be a respite of calm from festivities. Either way, the premise remains essentially the same \u2013 15 vaguely topical or general knowledge questions, liberally sprinkled with some in-jokes. Let us know how you get on in the comments.

(The accent has no relevance to or effect on the story, but Pearce has cultivated it so lovingly for the film it practically feels like a supporting character.) Cogburn lives alone because back in the 1980s, he wrote a novel called The Infernal Machine, a fable-like story about a priest who meets God. Somehow, Cogburn\u2019s book inspired a young man named Dwight Tufford (played by Alex Pettyfer), who he\u2019d never met, to climb a clock tower and kill people with a rifle, like mass murderer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/campus-carry-texas-law-ut-tower-massacre-anniversary\">Charles Whitman</a> back in 1966.</p><p>Now, in the film\u2019s present 25 years later (which would place the action some time in the early 00s), Cogburn starts receiving handwritten letters from someone called William DuKent. DuKent is also an author who seemingly wants to write a book about The Infernal Machine, Tufford and Cogburn, and asks the latter for his cooperation. At first, via messages left on an answering machine that form entertaining mini-monologues for Pearce to play the character in various states of sobriety, Cogburn politely refuses, and then grows more insistent that DuKent should leave off. But DuKent\u2019s efforts to reach Cogburn become more elaborate and aggressive, prompting Cogburn to start becoming actively paranoid as the situation grows increasingly strange.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/01/the-infernal-machine-review-guy-pearces-reclusive-novelist-dials-up-the-paranoia\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/dec/01/why-mystery-weekends-are-on-the-rise-short-break", "title": "The plot thickens: why murder mystery weekends are on the rise", "date_published": "2022-12-01 07:00:39+00:00", "description": "<p>Gory getaways are all the rage, thanks to glamorous extras, contemporary themes and a taste for escapism.

This could and should and sometimes manages to be a felicitous pairing of genre with gimmick, a novelty of theme proving vital to prolonging any winning formula. And just as Gene Kelly or Jackie Chan continuously innovated fresh shtick by incorporating unexpected props and environments into their high-physicality routines, so too does the rough-hewn Santa Claus (David Harbour) leading the counteroffensive get some good mileage out of the arsenal of decorative bric-a-brac at his disposal.</p><p>Not to be a Scrooge, but the occasional eye-gouge with a tree-topper star or string-light garotte only lends a frosty air of resourcefulness to a film with coal for brains.

The violence is embedded in the language used as the owners have an ugly way of referring to the slaves as \u201cit\u201d. The movie imagines Peter to be married to Dodienne (a fierce performance from Charmaine Bingwa), with whom he speaks French dialect, but is separated from his wife and children when he is bought by another owner and put brutally to work on the south\u2019s railroad and military fortifications.
