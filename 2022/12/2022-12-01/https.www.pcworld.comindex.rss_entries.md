## Intel Evo NFTs are the latest thing no one wants

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>At this point, NFTs have been derided as useless, a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://us.norton.com/blog/online-scams/nft-scams#&amp;xcust=2-1-1421785-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">route to potential scams</a>, and a simple waste of money. So, inexplicably, Intel is helping produce one.</p>



<p>A livestream shopping platform that we&rsquo;ve never heard of, NTWRK, has teamed up with a visual artist that we&rsquo;ve never heard of, King Saladeen, to design the Intel x King Saladeen line of NFTs&mdash;one of which is shown in our primary image, above. We have no idea who will own this particular NFT now that we&rsquo;ve published it, but that&rsquo;s not really our problem.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Each NFT features King Saladeen&rsquo;s iconic bear image graphic,&rdquo; according to a press release that dropped in our inbox. &ldquo;In one eye, viewers see a wifi [sic] symbol to symbolize the lightning fast internet speeds of Intel Evo Laptops, while the other eye features the visual artist&rsquo;s signature money sign.&nbsp; Each unique piece of digital artwork in this series will be created exclusively using Intel Evo Laptops, and celebrate the power of innovation while uplifting creators, like King Saladeen.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Intel and King Saladeen are debuting the NFTs at the NTWRK x Galore&rsquo;s Art Basel exhibition, which is taking place in Miami Beach. But the &ldquo;exclusive NFTs will be turned into limited-edition art prints&rdquo; which will be then be available via the NTWRK app. We&rsquo;re very confused about who will actually own the resulting Intel Evo Money Bear images, but we&rsquo;re getting bored of this whole concept already.</p>



<p>Apparently King Saladeen is big enough to produce a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.phl.org/at-phl/art-exhibitions/node/292&amp;xcust=2-1-1421785-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">mural that appears in the Philadelphia International Airport</a>, however.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Having been raised in a tough urban environment where artistic outlets were few and far between, Saladeen instead turned his attention to basketball,&rdquo; Saladeen&rsquo;s bio reads. &ldquo;Through traveling, Saladeen saw numerous places where his eyes were opened to the landscapes, shapes and colors that were vastly different from what he saw on a day to day basis. These opportunities allowed him to daydream on a greater scale and be influenced and inspired in a fresh way. In an effort to promote fearlessness and the idea that no one should be boxed in, Saladeen&rsquo;s art continues to meld the art world with fashion, music and now tech.&rdquo;</p>



<p>As one of our colleagues pointed out, at least it&rsquo;s not an Intel Evo cryptocurrency.</p>

## LastPass got hacked again, and this time it affects customers
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1419901/lastpass-got-hacked-again-and-this-time-it-affects-customers.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1419901/lastpass-got-hacked-again-and-this-time-it-affects-customers.html)

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>It&rsquo;s been a rough year for LastPass. Back in August, the popular password manager <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/917244/lastpass-got-hacked-but-you-werent-2.html">suffered a security breach</a>, in which the company&rsquo;s developer environment was infiltrated. At the time, LastPass said that while part of its source code and proprietary technical info were taken, customers were unaffected.</p>



<p>Now the company has experienced a second related hack, this time impacting customers. As <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/11/notice-of-recent-security-incident/&amp;xcust=2-1-1419901-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">reported Wednesday on its blog</a>, LastPass recently detected unusual activity within a third-party cloud storage service. An investigation has so far revealed that the breach stemmed from knowledge gained during the August 2022 incident, and that &ldquo;certain elements of customers&rsquo; information&rdquo; have been accessed. Further information is unavailable, as the investigation is still ongoing. LastPass says that customer passwords remain safely encrypted, however.</p>



<p>If you find this news unsettling despite the service earning recommendations (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">including ours</a>) for its day-to-day experience, your reaction is a fair one. LastPass has suffered hacks of its service in previous years, with notable incidents including <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.lastpass.com/2015/06/lastpass-security-notice/&amp;xcust=2-1-1419901-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">2015&rsquo;s unauthorized access</a> of user account email addresses, password reminders, and authentication hashes. Other security lapses include <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/3183586/password-stealing-flaws-in-lastpass-chrome-and-firefox-extensions.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1419901-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed">2017&rsquo;s browser extension vulnerability</a>, which allowed websites to steal passwords. In 2019, the same security researcher who discovered the 2017 issue also discovered <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/09/16/google-warns-lastpass-users-were-exposed-to-last-password-credential-leak/?sh=4504ad524600&amp;xcust=2-1-917244-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/917244/lastpass-got-hacked-but-you-werent-2.html">another browser extension vulnerability</a> that allowed the last used password to be leaked. The company has even made communication bumbles, like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lastpass-users-warned-their-master-passwords-are-compromised/&amp;xcust=2-1-1419901-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">security alert emails</a> sent to customers unaffected by a credential stuffing attack.</p>



<p>Other top-notch password managers haven&rsquo;t reported nearly as many incidents over the years, and if you&rsquo;re so inclined, you can make a switch to one of them pretty easily. You can also review the security on your LastPass account, making sure it falls in line with best practices, including the use of a strong password, enabling two factor authentication, and keeping a close eye on authorized devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as discomforting as this transparency may be, the underlying issue isn&rsquo;t the general concept of a password manager. They remain a vital part of online security, and you can find ways of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/709052/6-common-reasons-people-dont-use-a-password-manager-and-why-theyre-wrong.html">making them more comfortable</a> to use, even in the face of security breaches. Don&rsquo;t abandon them outright.</p>

## The best free VPN: It’s important to choose wisely

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Here&rsquo;s the thing: We&rsquo;re not fans of free VPNs because you have to be even more careful with these than a regular, paid VPN. If it&rsquo;s a free ad-supported VPN, for example, then your data is likely being used to earn money, which may defeat the whole point of a VPN. If privacy isn&rsquo;t an issue, then you have to deal with restrictions such as speeds, a bandwidth cap, or a limit to the countries you can access. </p>



<p>The bottom line is that if you truly want to use a VPN on a regular basis then it pays to pay for the privilege. With some VPNs charging the equivalent of just $5 a month or less there are definitely affordable options out there. But we know that not everyone shares this point of view. Some people are just looking for something to use quickly and easily without paying for yet another service. </p>



<p>Here, then, are the top free VPNs we can recommend. If you&rsquo;d like to see what you can get with a paid service, and which ones we recommend most highly, hop over to our comprehensive roundup of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html">the best VPNs</a>.</p>



<p><em><strong>Updated 11/30/22</strong> to include our updated <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407657/windscribe-vpn-review.html">review of Windscribe Pro</a>. It remains one of our favorites, as you can tell by its continued placement at the top of our picks. Read on to learn why we still think Windscribe is the best free VPN.</em></p>

<p>The Windscribe VPN service seems to get better and better each time we review a new version. It not only has an excellent Pro version that is reasonably priced, but it has a stand-out free service as well. What makes Windscribe&rsquo;s free service really stand out is all the perks. You get a maximum 10GB of bandwidth per month and no device limits. To get that bandwidth you need a confirmed email address. If not, you&rsquo;re stuck at 2GB per month.</p>

<p>The free service offers 10 regional connections including the U.S., Canada, UK, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway, and Romania. It also has a ton of privacy features such as blockers for site notifications and &ldquo;we use cookies&rdquo; banners, WebRTC leak protection, location spoofing, user agent rotation, and more.</p>

<p>The service is also extremely easy to use with a simple setup and solid performance for a free VPN. We not only recommend the Windscribe free service on its own, but also as an easy way to get to know the service before committing to a paid tier with premium features.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for speed and excellent privacy in a free VPN then ProtonVPN is an excellent choice. There are some big limitations with this service, but thankfully no limitations on speeds. </p>

<p>Instead, ProtonVPN limits you to one device connection at a time, and you only get three countries to choose from including the U.S., the Netherlands, and Japan. Still, that&rsquo;s a good deal, making this a very useful free VPN. </p>

<p>ProtonVPN is the second-fastest VPN in our tests making this the one you want if speed is important to you.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve always really liked TunnelBear. It&rsquo;s simple to use, affordable, and the speeds are fine. In our speed tests, TunnelBear was outside the top 20, but its speeds were still good last we looked, with an average global speed of 30.6 megabytes per second.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s more than enough for what this free VPN would be suited for, since you get a maximum of 500MB per month. The idea is to provide a trial for testing out the service before making a bigger commitment. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s enough for quick hits when you&rsquo;re on the road for checking email, or some basic web browsing. Plus, TunnelBear keeps track of your bandwidth usage so you can see when you&rsquo;re getting too close to the limit. </p>

<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-free-vpn">What to look for in a free VPN</h2>



<p>Choosing a free VPN is a question of weighing the trade-offs with each service. Do you want unlimited bandwidth, but a restriction on devices? Or is it preferable to have more devices but deal with a bandwidth limit? </p>



<p>One thing you definitely want to avoid is a VPN that is ad supported. Ads expose you to tracking by the company delivering ads, which is probably something you don&rsquo;t want. You also want to stay away from any deal that suggests you can get a VPN by &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; your bandwidth like we saw with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/427726/ultra-popular-hola-vpn-extension-sold-your-bandwidth-for-use-in-a-botnet-attack.html">the Hola VPN scandal</a> back in 2015. You also want to watch out for any VPNs you&rsquo;ve never heard of, or that haven&rsquo;t been reviewed much by third parties. </p>



<p>After that, you want to consider the usual issues such as the privacy policy, Netflix support, operating system support, and the countries that you&rsquo;re looking for. </p>



<h2 id="how-we-test-vpns">How we test VPNs</h2>



<p>All VPNs are tested on a Windows machine with an Ethernet connection. Our approach is not to show you actual speeds, since those can vary based on any number of factors like your ISP, time of day, device quality, and so on. Instead, we show the average bandwidth loss as a percentage since there&rsquo;s always going to be bandwidth loss with VPNs. </p>



<p>Each VPN is tested over three days. On each testing day, we first take the base speed with no VPN active. Then we test the speeds in five different countries three times each. Once all the testing is done we create a global average and compare that to the average base speed, and then express the drop in bandwidth as a percentage for the reasons we mentioned above. </p>



<p>Free VPNs aren&rsquo;t a top recommendation, but if you&rsquo;re going to go that way we&rsquo;d strongly suggest the five VPNs mentioned here. </p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-vpn">What is a VPN?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>A VPN, or Virtual private network, is a way to encrypt your internet traffic and disguise your identity while browsing the internet. Through a VPN provider, you connect to their anonymized server with end-to-end encryption which redirects all of your traffic through that intermediary server thereby looking to outside viewers as if your location is that server itself.</p>



<p>Additionally, VPNs allow you to connect to servers all across the world. So if you are looking to access location restricted content, such as streaming services, you can gain access via connecting to the appropriate country&rsquo;s server.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-a-vpn-work">How does a VPN work?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>A VPN hides your IP address by redirecting it through a intermediary server hosted by the VPN provider. To anyone watching, the VPN server then becomes the source of your traffic instead of your own IP address. These remote servers can not only be in your own country, but they can also be located in different countries around the world. All of your network traffic from your computer to the VPN is sent over a secure and encrypted connection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While browsing the internet and connected to a VPN, the VPN acts as a middleman between your computer and a website. Your computer sends a request to the VPN which then passes it on to a website. The website in return sends its response back to the VPN which forwards it through the secure connection back to your computer. All of the traffic rerouted through the VPN appears as if it is coming through their server rather than your own computer. This keeps your ISP and other third parties from potentially snooping on your internet activity.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Absolutely! In most countries, including the United States, it is perfectly legal to use a VPN. You might notice that some websites try to block VPN connections, but they are still okay to use. Please note, while using a VPN is legal, some of the activities done <em>while using</em> a VPN might be illegal. Activities such as downloading pirated copyrighted content or accessing dark web markets are both illegal with and without a VPN.</p>

## Bundle up your cold controller in a tiny, adorable Xbox hoodie

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>The history of gaming is littered with ridiculous accessories and add-ons. The Powerglove comes to mind, as does the Xbox Kinect. But the latest gaming accessory from Microsoft might just be the cutest little thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen precariously and superfluously stuck onto a gaming gadget: a hoodie for your controller. </p>



<p>The Xbox Mini Controller Hoodie is exactly what it sounds like, a tiny little jacket to keep your controller warm. According to the Xbox store &mdash; <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://gear.xbox.com/products/xbox-mini-controller-hoodie&amp;xcust=2-2-1421222-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">yes, this is an official Microsoft product!</a> &mdash; it&rsquo;s made of 100% polyester and comes complete with a teeny-tiny zipper and hood. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Xbox controller hoodie, white and black" class="wp-image-1421329" height="539" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/xbox-controller-hoodie-white-and-black.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Functionally, I suppose you could argue that the hood acts as an entry point for a charging cable. But who are we kidding? It&rsquo;s just freakin&rsquo; adorable. The style-conscious can buy it in white or black to match or complement your controller color. I&rsquo;m partial to the Xbox green lining on the black one, but the faux-camo pattern on the white does have a certain charm. </p>



<p>A tiny windbreaker for your controller costs just $24.99, about half the price of the controller itself. And, before you scoff,  someone&rsquo;s definitely buying these things because the initial batch is <em>already sold out</em>. Place an order today and it&rsquo;ll be delivered in late February. Presumably they&rsquo;ll work on your PlayStation or Switch controller too, but you know how unreliable cross-brand sizing can be. </p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>When it comes to gaming monitors, refresh rate is important. The refresh rate is how fast a monitor can pull up an image on screen. The faster the fresh rate, the smoother your game will look. For competitive first-person shooters, where every second counts, we&rsquo;d recommend 144Hz as the minimum rate. Anything higher is good enough for the eSports realm.</p>



<p>Resolution is another important feature to consider. Much like the refresh rate, the higher the number, the better. The resolution has a direct impact on image and video quality. 1080p is the best resolution for 24 inch monitors. For 27 inch monitors, 1440p is ideal. </p>



<p>Response time is a big one, too. Response time is how long it takes for a pixel to change color. A monitor with a 1ms (millisecond) response time, for example, is going to be faster than a monitor with a 5ms response time. This directly impacts how a monitor handles motion. </p>



<p>What about the size? Well, it depends on the distance from the screen. 24 inches is a good option if you&rsquo;re about three feet from the screen, as it&rsquo;s small enough to see everything without having to move your head around. 27 inches is better if you&rsquo;re further than three feet away from the screen.</p>

<p>4K monitors produce ultra-sharp sharp images and video, so bigger is better in this case. In order to see all those tiny details, we&rsquo;d suggest springing for a 31 inch monitor (at the very least). You need room for all those delicious pixels. That&rsquo;s why 4K monitors are perfect for photo or video editors. Watching movies on these monitors is a delightful experience as well.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>In terms of monitor size, 27-inches is the most common. That&rsquo;s a good size for a home office. For gaming monitors, 24 or 27 inches is best. You don&rsquo;t want to be swinging your head around too much in the middle of a fast-paced match. Plus, a larger screen may cause eye strain if you&rsquo;re sitting too close so it&rsquo;s better to go smaller. For 4K monitors, go with a 31 inch. 4K resolution brings next-level visuals, so you definitely want to go bigger.</p>

## Windows spyware steals data from your phone too

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Information security usually focuses on a single device, at least as far as consumers are concerned. But in an increasingly connected world, it might be worth re-examining that approach. Case in point: a newly discovered piece of malware in use by state-sponsored hacking groups. Private security company ESET found that the tool, once established on a Windows PC, will search the storage of any phone connected for even more information to steal. </p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/11/30/whos-swimming-south-korean-waters-meet-scarcrufts-dolphin/&amp;xcust=2-2-1420839-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The &ldquo;Dolphin&rdquo; malware</a> is connected to multiple spyware and digital espionage groups believed to be working for the government of North Korea, primarily for the purposes of gathering information on South Korea and other Asian governments and industrial interests. It&rsquo;s being deployed to specific targets. The tool uses fairly standard Python-based methods of searching a victim&rsquo;s machine, then uploading sensitive information like passwords and other security credentials to a Google Drive account, where hackers can easily retrieve it. It also collects keystrokes for passwords, targeted extension files, and screenshots. The ESET report was spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-windows-malware-scans-victims-mobile-phones-for-data-to-steal/&amp;xcust=2-2-1420839-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BleepingComputer</a>. </p>



<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is the expanded hardware scope. Once installed on a Windows device, the Dolphin program will also scan any portable storage connected via the Windows Portable Device API. This is the system that recognizes an Android or iPhone&rsquo;s storage as different from, say, a USB flash drive. Upon connection, Dolphin performs the same search for sensitive information and files on the phone&rsquo;s storage. It doesn&rsquo;t appear that there&rsquo;s a means of actively compromising a phone once it&rsquo;s physically disconnected from the PC. </p>



<p>So far, Dolphin is being deployed in &ldquo;watering hole&rdquo; attacks, which infect websites frequented by high-profile users connected to governments, banks, and other potential high-level targets. It indicates that it&rsquo;s being used to target specific users or groups with access to valuable data or systems. In other words, this isn&rsquo;t the kind of infection you get from downloading a sketchy browser extension. Even so, it&rsquo;s a sobering reminder that the data storage on your phone isn&rsquo;t any more or less secure than that on your PC&hellip;and both can become points of vulnerability to the other. </p>

## Beyond fans: AirJet’s radical CPU cooling chips can double laptop performance

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Fans keep chips cool. Most consumers know that, whether they&rsquo;ve opened up their laptop or heard the whiny hiss of a fan. But a startup involved with Intel is using <em>chips</em> to keep microprocessors cool, massively boosting performance and changing laptop design forever.</p>



<p>Frore Systems is manufacturing two chips, the AirJet Mini and the AirJet Pro, that will be affixed to a laptop&rsquo;s processor in place of a heat pipe or fan. Both chips actively, but nearly silently, cool the laptop&rsquo;s CPU, supplying more air pressure but less acoustic noise than a conventional fan, according to company executives. But it&rsquo;s the overall performance advantage &mdash; up to double! &mdash; that you&rsquo;ll care about.</p>



<p>This is the argument behind the AirJet: &ldquo;Very often, it&rsquo;s the thermal solution capability that dictates how good the performance you&rsquo;re getting out of a device,&rdquo; said Dr. Seshu Madhavapeddy, Frore&rsquo;s chief executive.</p>



<p>Virtually all processors include thermal sensors that &ldquo;throttle&rdquo; the chip to avoid overheating. At the same time, processors are <em>designed</em> to overheat; by putting the chip into an overclocked &ldquo;turbo&rdquo; mode, desktop and laptop chips alike will push past those thermal constraints to offer a brief period of increased performance. After that period expires, however (sometimes known as the &ldquo;tau&rdquo;) the processor drops back down to what we generally consider its rated speed, or PL1. </p>



<p>What Frore and the AirJet Mini and Airjet Pro are designed to do is to extend that &ldquo;tau&rdquo; period. In the case of an Arm-based PC notebook, Frore believes that the tau can be extended indefinitely. By pairing the processor with four AirJet Minis, a 1.8GHz Arm chip will run at its boosted speed of 3.5GHz &ldquo;forever,&rdquo; Madhavapeddy said. AirJet Pros, designed for X86 laptops, have a similar effect: a chip which could boost to 4.8GHz could instead drop down to a new PL1 of 2.1GHz, rather than the normal 1.4GHz you&rsquo;d get using a pair of conventional fans. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Frore AirJet cooling chip" class="wp-image-1417843" height="511" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Case-studies.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Frore predicts that its AirJet chips can dramatically cut the internal heat within a laptop, and thus allow that laptop to run longer in a higher-power mode. In the case of a laptop, that would be about 1.5 times its current performance.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Frore Systems</p></div>



<p>Frore&rsquo;s AirJet chips use a combination of fluidic, acoustic, and electrical resonance principles to suck cool air in from the top of the chip and push it out the sides at approximately the same temperature of the heat coming from the surface of the laptop processor itself. It&rsquo;s then up to the laptop maker to vent that heat outside.</p>



<p>What it all boils down to is simple: by running a processor in its turbo mode, for longer, the laptop&rsquo;s performance can increase dramatically. Or, as Frore itself puts it: &ldquo;AirJet doubles processor performance.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 id="how-frores-airjet-chips-work">How Frore&rsquo;s AirJet chips work</h2>



<p>Desktops use a variety of techniques to cool chips and extend the tau time: radiators and coolers, large fans, even water cooling through a number of hoses. But a desktop case affords the physical space to make those solutions viable. Laptops and tablets are extremely space constrained, making these solutions far less practical. That&rsquo;s why Frore&rsquo;s AirJet is so interesting.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Heat is by far the biggest hurdle we need to overcome in computing,&rdquo; said Patrick Moorhead, chief analyst at Moor Insights &amp; Strategy, and a former AMD executive, in a statement. &ldquo;Thermally stressed hardware doesn&rsquo;t perform optimally, and current thermal solutions fall short. I believe Frore Systems has reinvented thermal technology with its AirJet chip that doubles active heat removal with a thinner, silent solution that provides greater performance.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The Frore AirJet chips work by sucking air through the top of the chip inside of it, where the heat is exchanged and then vented out to the sides of the chip. To create the suction, Frore placed vibrating membranes inside the chip, which resonate at tens of microns of amplitude. According to Madhavapeddy, the membranes resonate at what he calls &ldquo;structural resonance,&rdquo; to create the maximum vibration using the least amount of power. Sensors in the chip dynamically adjust the resonance frequency as the temperature changes, he added. Frore claims that the heat transferred is near saturation, pulling the most heat possible from the processor itself. (It&rsquo;s up to the laptop maker to vent the hot air to the outside world.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Frore AirJet cooling chip" class="wp-image-1417844" height="524" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-AirJet-works.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Air is sucked in from the top of an AirJet via a series of vibrating membranes, which then &ldquo;squirt&rdquo; the air down onto the processor&rsquo;s heat spreader.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Frore Systems</p></div>



<p>&ldquo;As [the membranes] vibrate, they pull air in from the top &mdash; they create the suction force which automatically pulls the air from the top into the chip,&rdquo; Madhavapeddy said. &ldquo;And then the air is pushed down through, kind of like a sea at the bottom of the cavity. And it&rsquo;s kind of like a showerhead, so the air comes through the top, and it&rsquo;s pushed down through this sea&hellip; And these [shower] jets are impinging on the copper heat spreader on the bottom. Heat transfer happens when these pulsating vents of air are hitting the copper heat spreader. They extract heat from the copper heat spreader with very high efficiency, and then the air exits.&rdquo;</p>



<p>This all happens in a chip that&rsquo;s only 2.8mm thick, Madhavapeddy added.</p>



<p>Madhavapeddy claimed that the AirJet chips deliver more then ten times the pressure of a typical laptop fan, while falling beneath the acoustic floor (21 to 24dBA) of a &ldquo;silent&rdquo; solution. Because of the high back pressure, he said, the intake holes can be covered with an IP68 waterproof/dustproof material, allowing a laptop maker to prevent dust and other particles from coating the inside of a laptop.</p>



<p>&ldquo;A big advantage&hellip;is how your notebook operates when you place it on a pillow or on a mattress,&rdquo; Madhavapeddy said. &ldquo;In a typical notebook, the inlet vents are at the bottom of the notebook. You&rsquo;ll see a lot of holes at the bottom for almost every notebook. And if you place it on a desk, that&rsquo;s okay because they have little stacks in order to lift the notebook a little bit so that there&rsquo;s a gap, and the air can go through the gap up through the vents at the bottom of the notebook into the fans. But when you place it on a pillow or mattress, those walls are all blocked and the fans get choked. As a result, you don&rsquo;t get the benefit of the fan.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We completely eliminate that problem because, in our case, you don&rsquo;t need to have any vents at the bottom,&rdquo; Madhavapeddy added.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Frore AirJet cooling chip" class="wp-image-1417841" height="350" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AIrJet-specs.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>How the AirJet Mini and AirJet Pro compare to a typical laptop fan, according to Frore.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Frore Systems</p></div>



<p>Right now, the MiniJet solution is targeting mobile devices &mdash; laptops, tablets, and VR headsets. The next generation, designed to be thinner and lighter, will take aim at smartphones, Madhavapeddy said.</p>



<p>Though Frore manufactures its chips in a fab in Taiwan, the company uses a variety of techniques from various industries (from flat-panel manufacturing to aerospace) to affix the vibrating membrane to the anchor.</p>



<p>Madhavapeddy said that Intel is working with Frore to explore how the AirJet technology could improve its own chips. It&rsquo;s unclear, however, how much this solution will add to the cost of a laptop or laptop processor. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re competitive relative to the value that we&rsquo;re delivering,&rdquo; Madhavapeddy said. &ldquo;We are engaged with several OEMs and we expect you will see products in the market in 2023.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 id="how-intel-is-involved-with-frores-airjet">How Intel is involved with Frore&rsquo;s AirJet</h2>



<p>According to Intel, the two companies are involved in an &ldquo;engineering collaboration&rdquo; designed to improve the performance of Intel&rsquo;s Evo laptops, which are co-designed with the laptop makers themselves. Intel, Frore, and select PC makers are working together to co-implement the MiniJet technology and help Frore bring it to market.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Intel&rsquo;s mission with Intel Evo is to unite the open PC ecosystem to deliver the best possible laptop experiences that people want,&rdquo; said Josh Newman, vice president and general manager of mobile platforms at Intel, in a statement. &ldquo;Engineering thin, light, stylish laptop designs that offer great performance while remaining cool and quiet are foundational to that mission.&nbsp;Frore Systems&rsquo; AirJet technology offers a new and novel approach to help achieve these design goals in new ways and Intel is excited about the engineering collaboration with Frore Systems to help ready their technology for future Intel Evo laptops.&rdquo; </p>



<p>An Intel spokeswoman said via email that there is no financial arrangement beyond a development agreement. In the past year, Intel has helped Frore implement prototype chips into real notebooks, helped set engineering targets like fan noise and skin temperature, redesigned some of the surrounding motherboard architecture, invited Frore engineers to Intel&rsquo;s Bangalore lab for debugging and tuning, and gave &ldquo;practical guidance&rdquo; to help Frore work with more hardware makers via improved layouts and prototyping.</p>



<p>At this point, it&rsquo;s not clear how much cost the AirJet will add to a laptop, or in what numbers AirJets can be manufactured. Will AMD sign on to use the technology? Will an AirJet competitor emerge? All these questions will eventually be answered. But the fact remains that Frore, and its AirJet technology, are one of the most interesting additions to laptops and PCs in years. </p>

## Asus ExpertBook B3 review: A flexible PC that feels punishingly slow

</div>


<p>What can I say? I love a tiny computer. It seems like only yesterday that there were weird, cheap Windows machines galore, using small screens anywhere from 7 to 10 inches. Some of these tablets had active pens and almost all of them were incredibly slow or had a washed-out screen or some other terrible shortcoming. But, if you were willing to wait for their slow chips to chug along, they could be &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; in a pinch when running old apps or simple Office tasks.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s why the new Asus Expertbook B3 seemed so intriguing. Not only is this a small computer with a kickstand and a keyboard cover, it&rsquo;s a tiny device with a pen that neatly tucks away into a silo. It&rsquo;s even based on a newer Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 processor, which promises power-sipping, fanless operation. Can this little tablet overcome its modest spec sheet and give users a decent Windows 11 experience? In a word, no.</p>



<h2 id="asus-experbook-b3-specs-and-features">Asus ExperBook B3 specs and features</h2>



<p>Our review unit came equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 CPU, Adreno 618 graphics, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of eMMC storage. Read on to learn more:</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Expertbook kickstand" class="wp-image-1380972" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/asus-expertbook-b3-detachable-vertical.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface basically invented the modern 2-in-1, putting the keyboard cover front-and-center and balancing the whole widget on a kickstand around the back. The ExpertBook B3 is a similar design, except the kickstand isn&rsquo;t built-in. Instead, it&rsquo;s a piece of fabric-wrapped plastic that attaches with magnets to the tablet. What this enables is a mode that lets you stand it up in vertical orientation, not just horizontally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I found the stand to be loosely connected except in its horizontal orientation with the keyboard attached. You certainly can&rsquo;t use it as an easel for drawing with this stand&ndash;the angle it folds to is far too shallow to get it down to the tabletop. And then when you have it in vertical mode, there&rsquo;s no way to connect the keyboard and the USB port is inaccessible, under the edge that&rsquo;s facing the tabletop. I can see this degree of flexibility being helpful is you use your tablet in the kitchen as a cookbook, but otherwise it seems like a lot of engineering and bulk for an edge case.</p>



<p>At least Asus includes the kickstand attachment and keyboard cover in the box, so they&rsquo;re not separate purchases. But the whole package feels a bit bulky when all put together, but the tablet on its own is impressively slim.</p>



<h2 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h2>



<p>Given its small size, we can&rsquo;t say we were surprised to find only two ports on this Asus tablet&ndash;a standard headset jack and a USB-C port. The USB-C port pulls double duty as your only charging port and the single option for I/O. At least there&rsquo;s a huge market out there for dongles and hubs, making it simple to turn one port into a bunch of others, including display-out.</p>



<p>In terms of wireless capability, the B3 has Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 5.1 as default, making it a bit behind the curve on Wi-Fi tech but totally usable for day-to-day tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It would have been really nice to see a microSD card slot in this tablet as well, which can help make up for a lack of storage, but alas you&rsquo;re stuck with the 128 GB eMMC this tablet has built-in. It seems like since it has a US MIL-STD 810H durability rating that Asus removed as much as possible to reduce the possibility for failure. All things considered, the B3&rsquo;s connectivity definitely feels like a downgrade from something like a Surface Go 3, which has a magnetic dock/charging port, USB-C, headset jack, as well as a microSD card slot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="keyboard-trackpad-and-pen">Keyboard, trackpad, and pen</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Expertbook keyboard and trackpad" class="wp-image-1380966" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/asus-expertbook-b3-detachable-keyboard-trackpad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>One of the worst things about buying a Microsoft Surface is that the pen and keyboard cover are separate purchases. Here, everything comes in the box. I found, however, that the accessories that are necessary to turn this tablet into a laptop are a decidedly mixed bag. The keyboard is okay, but the keys are definitely small compared to, let&rsquo;s say, a 13-inch class laptop or tablet. While the inside of the keyboard cover is plastic, the whole thing feels slightly bouncy to type on, which is less than ideal in my eyes. Then, when the lights go out you discover&ndash;gasp!&ndash; these keys aren&rsquo;t backlit! I hate to put a bunch of expectations on this little device but when you use something called ExpertBook, you tend to expect a better-than-basic typing experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beneath the keyboard is a dinky touchpad that I didn&rsquo;t quite get along with. It&rsquo;s responsive enough, but the surface feels plasticky and rough. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s so small on this keyboard cover that I found it was super easy to hit the edges with the palms of my hands. Finally, the floppiness of the keyboard cover made it easy to accidentally trigger the trackpad&rsquo;s click. This might be an edge case for a device designed for schools and businesses, but this was something I noticed when using the device on the sofa, when it has little support underneath the keyboard and trackpad.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Expertbook pen and touchpad" class="wp-image-1380968" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/asus-expertbook-b3-detachable-pen.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>One of the more unique aspects of the Asus B3 is that is has an included digital pen that has its own silo for storage&ndash;no magnets, no hidey hole in the keyboard cover. The pen charges when replaced into the back of the display, which is pretty great. For notes, this pen works well enough but I&rsquo;d skip this tablet for art purposes due to some noticeable jitter in lines I drew. That and the pen&rsquo;s less-than-ergonomic skinny body make this a nice bonus, but far from a star attraction.</p>



<h2 id="display-audio-and-webcam">Display, audio, and webcam</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Expertbook hero" class="wp-image-1380970" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/asus-expertbook-b3-detachable-hero-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>The only aspect of this device I have a slight gripe with is the small display and big bezels. The screen has a piano black surround, and then a big black border. Before you turn it on, you&rsquo;d expect that the screen would fill the inside of the black plastic border, but instead it&rsquo;s nested way inside the glass with a thick border doesn&rsquo;t look super premium in 2022.</p>



<p>At least the screen is great to behold. The Asus B3&rsquo;s dinky 10.5-inch display is a high 1920&times;1200 resolution, looks vibrant from every angle, and reaches a bright and consistent 350 nits. The glossy surface might pick up glare or make it hard to see in direct sunlight, but in any other conditions I loved the way it looks. It&rsquo;s also a laminated display, which can make the interaction with the screen feel more direct than one with a gap between the cover glass and the display itself below (digital pen users will notice the difference!). The punchy colors, nice contrast, and crisp pixel density make this a device that&rsquo;s at least nice to look at, even if it&rsquo;s maddening to use in other regards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The front facing camera on the B3 is pretty good all things considered. It&rsquo;s a far cry from the 720p and 1080p units in a lot of laptops, actually letting you get 5 megapixel stills. For video calls, the higher megapixel camera helps but I still looked a little blotchy in anything less than bright light. The speakers and microphone are both decent. That said, the speakers are a bit quiet and might struggle in a chatty classroom or office setting</p>



<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>



<p>If there&rsquo;s one frustratingly weak point for the Asus ExpertBook B3, it&rsquo;s performance. This tiny tablet has a decent enough Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 processor, but the slow solid state drive and limited RAM seriously limit its abilities. This thing feels like using Windows 11 while it&rsquo;s stuck in quicksand.</p>



<p>In use, B3 takes forever to boot up, as if it&rsquo;s emerging from a deep sleep, and Edge needs to sleep browser tabs constantly to free up memory. Sitting here with OneNote and four browser tabs open, Task Manager says 3.3 GB of RAM are in use&hellip;yikes! Even things you&rsquo;d want to be snappy and satisfying, like pressing the Start button on the touchscreen lag.</p>



<p>If you didn&rsquo;t know much about computers, you&rsquo;d suspect something was wrong. It&rsquo;s made worse by the lackluster ability of Windows 11 Pro to emulate older apps. Even though it should cut the mustard when it comes to lightweight mobile-friendly software, I found the B3 rendered an indie game like <em>Donut County</em> unplayable under emulation. But don&rsquo;t take my word for it&ndash;let&rsquo;s take a look at some benchmarks.</p>



<p>In the PCMark 10 Apps test, which runs natively on Snapdragon devices like the Asus B3, we saw a score that was less than impressive. In fact, it missed the standard of a Lenovo Snapdragon-based device that&rsquo;s almost four years old. For the sake of comparison, we&rsquo;ve included a Surface Pro from last year running a premium Intel chip just to demonstrate how sluggish this tablet is. This test uses Microsoft&rsquo;s own apps to run different task in order to measure the responsiveness of the system in Office and Edge scenarios.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Expertbook PCMark" class="wp-image-1380975" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pcmark-10-apps-chart.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>The Asus ExpertBook B3 turned in a disappointing showing when its graphics were put to the test in the ARM-friendly Night Raid benchmark. This poor performance makes a certain amount of sense, however, since we&rsquo;re dealing with a cheaper Snapdragon chip with a worse GPU. The rest of the bunch we had tested all had that year&rsquo;s best graphics, which this decidedly does not.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Expertbook 3DMark" class="wp-image-1380977" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/3dmark-night-raid.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>Since web browsing is an essential part of today&rsquo;s computing experience, we ran the WebXPRT3 benchmark to get an sense for how this system performs with a variety of tasks in the Edge browser. Although the B3 outperformed the older Lenovo Yoga C630 in this test, it&rsquo;s still a poor performer on the whole.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Expertbook WebXPRT 3" class="wp-image-1380979" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/webxprt3-chart.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<h2 id="battery-life">Battery life</h2>



<p>One bright spot in the performance tests was the long-lasting battery. In our looping 4K video test, the Asus ExpertBook B3 nearly made it to 14 hours of runtime, which is stellar for a tiny Windows tablet like this. Anecdotally, while writing this review on the Asus, I saw the battery drain around 5% for an hour of light work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Expertbook battery life" class="wp-image-1380978" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/asus-b3-battery-life.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>At the end of my time with the Asus ExpertBook B3, I was left with one question: who is this for? The marketing makes it seem like it&rsquo;s for frontline workers or the education market, but I&rsquo;d feel bad handing this off to an employee and even worse for the kids stuck with this in a computer lab. It&rsquo;s also available on Best Buy for anyone to purchase, which I&rsquo;d advise against unless it&rsquo;s deeply discounted. Even without thinking of competing options, there&rsquo;s not a great case for its $600 price.</p>



<p>Even with stellar battery life, included accessories, and a nice screen, the Asus B3 reminds us that Windows on a Snapdragon chip can still have a lot of drawbacks, especially in a cheaper configuration like this. Sure, the overall experience has improved a lot on the high-end with the Surface Pro 9 and ThinkPad X13s Gen 1, but for now you may want to steer clear of these low-end Snapdragon Windows PCs.</p>

<p>When it comes to vertical monitors, there&rsquo;s the LG DualUp 28MQ780-B, and then there&rsquo;s everything else.</p>

<p>This monitor&rsquo;s dominance is due to its unique 16:18 aspect ratio, which can be rotated 90 degrees for an 18:16 aspect ratio. In this orientation the monitor is roughly as tall as a 24-inch monitor in vertical orientation, but much wider.</p>

<p>You can view 3:2 or 9:16 content in a photo or video editing program at its full height and still have room on either side for the program&rsquo;s tools. It&rsquo;s also a wonderful fit for editing large, complex documents, like a magazine layout or PDF.</p>

<p>The LG DualUp 28MQ780-B scores well in other areas, too. It&rsquo;s bright, color accurate, and has a wide color gamut. Connectivity is solid and includes a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and up to 90 watts of Power Delivery for charging a connected device. It also ships with a highly adjustable monitor arm that&rsquo;s perfect for positioning the monitor alongside another display.</p>

<p>Priced at an MSRP of $699.99, and sometimes on sale for around $650, this monitor is not inexpensive&mdash;but it&rsquo;s affordable enough to make most high-end alternatives irrelevant. The only significant downside is its resolution which, at 2560&times;2880, comes in a bit shy of 4K.</p>

<p>The Dell U3223QE is an awesome monitor and currently ranked <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">at the top of PC World&rsquo;s best monitors guide</a>. It ships with a versatile ergonomic stand that can rotate 90 degrees for vertical use, which is rare for a 32-inch monitor.</p>

<p>Image quality sets the Dell U3223QE apart from the pack. It has a 4K IPS Black panel with a contrast ratio roughly double that of older IPS panels. This provides a richer, deeper, and more realistic image. The U3223QE also has extremely accurate color, a very wide color gamut, and high maximum brightness.</p>

<p>The monitor has a buffet of connectivity which includes a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and up to 90 watts of Power Delivery. The USB-C port connects to five additional USB-A ports, ethernet, and DisplayPort-out, which makes a USB-C hub or dock unnecessary.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dell sells a smaller version of this monitor, <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8200811-12839518?url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-27-4k-usb-c-hub-monitor-u2723qe/apd/210-bdpf/monitors-monitor-accessories&amp;sid=2-1-1397406-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">the Dell U2723QE</a>, which packs the same features into a smaller footprint. It&rsquo;s a couple hundred dollars less than its bigger sibling but retains the stand that can rotate the monitor into vertical orientation.</p>

<p>NZXT&rsquo;s Canvas 27Q is a great budget monitor with an unusual wrinkle that makes it ideal for vertical use: The stand, which does rotate for vertical use, is a $40 option. NZXT also sells a monitor arm for $100.</p>

<p>Why is this a perk? Vertical monitors are often used in less common situations and spaces, so it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;ll want to replace the stand with a monitor arm. As a result, a bundled stand is dead weight. But if you <em>do</em> want the optional stand, that&rsquo;s also fine&mdash;NZXT&rsquo;s stand is sleek, sturdy, and can rotate for vertical use.</p>

<p>Either way, the Canvas 27Q is an excellent monitor. It delivers 1440p resolution, exceptional color accuracy, a wide color gamut, and a high maximum brightness. The monitor&rsquo;s overall image quality isn&rsquo;t far off the Dell U3223QE and rivals the LG DualUp 28MQ780-B. The Canvas 27Q also supports an enhanced refresh rate of up to 165Hz.</p>

<p>Selling the display without a stand helps NZXT achieve a competitive price. The Canvas 27Q has an MSRP of $319.99 but frequently sells for just $249.99. This monitor is such good value, in fact, that it eliminates other 27-inch 1440p monitors from consideration. If you want to go vertical, and you don&rsquo;t need 4K, this is your best bet.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-vertical-monitor">What to look for in a vertical monitor</h2>



<p>The most important trait in a vertical monitor is, of course, support for vertical use.</p>



<p>This is technically possible with any monitor that has a 100x100m VESA mount, as you can add a third-party monitor stand or arm that allows rotation for vertical use. However, an ideal vertical monitor will support this from the factory or, in less common cases, make the stand optional (so you can decide on your own).</p>



<h3 id="aspect-ratio-matters-but-you-dont-have-much-choice">Aspect ratio matters, but you don&rsquo;t have much choice</h3>



<p>A monitor&rsquo;s aspect ratio has a big impact on its usefulness. A standard 16:9 monitor rotated for vertical use becomes a 9:16 monitor. That&rsquo;s a somewhat awkward fit for a lot of content.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s why the LG DualUp 28Q780-B is the top pick. Its unusual 16:18 aspect ratio, which becomes a 18:16 aspect ratio in vertical use, is a far more versatile and practical choice. No other monitor on the market has this aspect ratio.</p>



<p>There are other options. A few monitors have a 16:10 aspect ratio, which becomes 10:16 in vertical use. This is less awkward than 9:16 but still not excellent. There&rsquo;s also a handful of specialty monitors with a 3:2 or 5:4 aspect ratio. Unfortunately, these alternatives are rare and often lackluster in image quality when compared to more common widescreen monitors, which is why we can&rsquo;t recommend them.</p>



<h3 id="image-quality-depends-on-your-needs">Image quality depends on your needs</h3>



<p>Aspect ratio aside, the features that make for a good vertical monitor are no different from a monitor used in the standard, horizontal orientation.</p>



<p>4K resolution, or something close to it, is ideal, while 1440p is a good compromise for more affordable monitors. Also look for a monitor with a maximum brightness of at least 300 nits, as this will help overcome glare. Good color accuracy and a wide color gamut aren&rsquo;t necessary for all people, but preferable, and all the vertical monitors we recommend score well in these areas.</p>



<h3 id="usb-c-is-useful-for-vertical-monitors">USB-C is useful for vertical monitors</h3>



<p>USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate mode is an alternative to HDMI and DisplayPort. It adds a DisplayPort video connection to the familiar USB-C port supported by many laptops and tablets (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341415/europe-sets-deadline-for-usb-c-charging-for-almost-all-laptops.html">which is now mandated in Europe</a>).</p>



<p>Unlike HDMI and DisplayPort, USB-C has the option to provide power through a standard called USB Power Delivery. This will charge a connected laptop, tablet, or other device. The LG and Dell monitors on this list support this feature, while the NZXT monitor does not.</p>



<p>Want to know more about how USB-C works on a monitor? <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/612470/you-should-buy-a-usb-c-hub-monitor-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html">Our guide to USB-C hub monitors</a> has the details.</p>



<h3 id="a-monitor-arm-can-be-useful-for-vertical-use">A monitor arm can be useful for vertical use</h3>



<p>A desktop monitor stand is acceptable for vertical use if it supports rotation into vertical orientation, but a monitor arm is preferable.</p>



<p>An arm provides a wider range of movement in all directions. A vertical monitor will, in most cases, be used as a second display&mdash;and an arm makes aligning the first and second displays easier.</p>



<h2 id="how-we-test-monitors">How we test monitors</h2>



<p>PCWorld&rsquo;s monitor guides are informed by hundreds of reviews from our team of staff and freelance experts. These guides combine tens of thousands of hours of testing and decades of combined expertise.</p>



<p>We test monitors using a SpyderXElite color calibration tool. This tool provides objective measurements of color accuracy, color gamut, color temperature, brightness, gamma, and contrast, among other metrics. Objective results help us compare dozens of monitors without bias to find the best in each category.</p>
