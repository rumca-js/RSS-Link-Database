Technologies such as cloud-based apps and services, along with regulatory requirements around the storage and protection of customer data, have required companies to explore technology solutions for document and data management.</p><p>In earlier days, this meant investing in a <em>document management system (DMS)</em>, which helped companies digitally store and manage paper-based and online documents. The rise of web-based technologies created <em>content management systems (CMSes)</em>, which managed digitally created content, but also included formats such as audio, video, images, and HTML-based files.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3680556/how-enterprise-content-management-is-evolving-from-monolith-to-modular.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.computerworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/3681830/so-you-were-laid-off-dont-panic.html#tk.rss_all", "title": "So, you were laid off?
