Peterson and Matt Ridley go in depth to explore the Covid 19 outbreak, scrutinizing the lack of criticism, the inherent red flags widely accepted as benign, the possible motive for a multi-government cover up, and ultimately the demise of the scientific enlightenment as it bends to a more fearsome pandemic: totalitarianism. \n \nMatt Ridley is a British writer, journalist, and public speaker. His books collectively have sold over a million copies, and have been translated into 31 languages. His books include The Red Queen, The Origins of Virtue, Genome, Nature via Nurture, Francis Crick, The Rational Optimist, The Evolution of Everything, and How Innovation Works. He is also frequently published in the Wall Street Journal, and in the Times (London), as a columnist. As a speaker, Ridley has seen over two million views for his TED talk, \u201cWhen Ideas Have Sex.\u201d Ridley focuses on the area of science for his writings, and held the role  of science editor at the Economist for nine years.\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Matt Ridley:\n\nMatt Ridley\u2019s newest book, Viral, is now available in a revised and expanded edition, find it here https://www.amazon.com/Viral-Search-COVID-19-Matt-Ridley/dp/006313912X or the audio/digital version here https://a.co/d/aVdU6zV \n\nMatt Ridley\u2019s Website https://www.mattridley.co.uk/ \n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/mattwridley?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor \n\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/authormattridley/ \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(1:31) Intro\n(4:25) The origin of the Covid 19 outbreak\n(7:39) Adapted for humans\n(11:42) Immediate effectiveness\n(13:50) Inserted genetic information\n(16:29) Early concerns of engineering, the pangolin problem\n(20:00) Reputation management, potential cover up\n(25:00) The smoking gun, Project Defuse\n(28:24) The impossibility of ethical science in a totalitarian country\n(33:50) When presumptions don\u2019t add up\n(37:00) Framing the pandemic as political, a distraction\n(45:16) 80,000 animals tested in Wuhan, 0 infected\n(50:30) The lack of criticism for the Chinese government\n(53:53) Potential darkness, spreading totalitarianism\n(57:03) China envy, recalling the USSR\n(1:01:23) Other possible motives\n(1:05:24) The sad evolution of scientific inquiry\n(1:09:30) The demise of the enlightenment \n(1:17:15) The antagonism between religion and science\n(1:22:07) Truth over consequence\n(1:28:01) The conflation of religion as a faith and as an institution\n(1:36:00) The spirit of inquiry\n(1:38:37) Dawkins; not seeking the answer, following the questions\n(1:43:20) The truth will set you free\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus", "persistent": false}]
