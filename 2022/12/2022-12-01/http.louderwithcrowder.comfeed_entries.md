What you may not know is that any money they win, they have to share with the girls as part of a virtue-signaling collective bargaining agreement. The women expect to get paid as much as the men, even though men's soccer brings in a ton more money because a ton more people care about men's soccer.</p><p>But the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-megan-rapinoe" target="_blank">women complained and the left is the left</a>. Somehow the men are forced to give up the money they earned otherwise they hate... you know, the thing. Though there is a surprising voice of reason throughout all this. CNN's Don Lemon. He said -- on CNN -- the men SHOULD be getting paid more.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

## Check out this guy so fed up with China's lockdowns he's ready to go all Shaolin kung-fu on the health 'experts'

No matter how much American health experts would <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anthony-fauci-shanghai" target="_blank">find China's lockdowns effective if they could get away with it</a>. Or how many times <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anthony-fauci-drone" target="_blank">American health experts say things similar to the CCP</a>. It can't happen here.

## Watch: Lawyer pulls gun on unarmed girlfriend, gets smacked with regret thanks to the other dudes saving the day

That's what happened at Anderson Mill Pub. Thankfully there were two heroes who lept into action in a reminder that while it may be Austin, it's still Texas. Though we later find out that while it may be Texas, it's still Austin.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Earlier this week there was a shooting at a local bar in my district. This attorney belongs behind bars, pending a lengthy jury of his peers. I‚Äôm deeply disturbed watching this video and committed to a safe city. <a href="https://t.co/eHbjnlEDxd">pic.twitter.com/eHbjnlEDxd</a><br />‚Äî Mackenzie Kelly (@mkelly007) <a href="https://twitter.com/mkelly007/status/1597367337958912001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The failed gunman is Gavin Rush, and the bartender is his ex-girlfriend. Gavin was upset that his ex was with someone new and didn't handle the news well. While most of us listen to sad music and sob, he went to kill his ex and himself. What you don't see in the video, <a href="https://www.kvue.com/article/news/crime/austin-police-man-arrested-pulling-gun-bar/269-c8d7e6e6-939d-4d85-9c36-e6882d1b909a" target="_blank">according to KVUE</a>, when he pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the woman's chest... he activated a laser sight on her.</p><p>The other two dudes didn't even think. They took him down like a rodeo clown. Both men want to stay anonymous, but they told the media of the incident: <em>"I don't remember doing this, but I pushed his hand up and the gun went off. Then we started flying backwards. I turned and grabbed him around the neck and another shot went off."</em></p><p>The badassery is the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/immigrant-trump-burger-restaurant" target="_blank">Texas</a> part of the story. The <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/porch-pirate-austin-diapers" target="_blank">Austin</a> part of the story is the guy who tried to kill his girlfriend is already back out on the street.</p><blockquote>Rush was charged with a second-degree felony, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon family violence. While a emergency protection order was granted, Rush was let out on a $40,000 bond before the weekend was over. </blockquote><p>Well, at least she got the emergency protection order. Gavin sounds like the type of guy who will follow the law. Except for this one time. And this one other time in 2017 where he was "charged with assault/family violence" by "impeding breath/circulation."</p><p>That case was dismissed after he went through anger management. I don't think the classes worked.</p><p><p>

## Watch: LeBron James is big mad reporters haven't asked him about what a racist Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is

There was a sixty-five-year-old photo of Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones standing outside an Arkansas protest in the 60s. <em>The Washington Post</em> made the leap that the sixty-five-year-old photo is why there has never been a black Dallas Cowboys coach. LeBron was never asked about it by reporters. However, those same reporters couldn't wait to ask him about his peer Kyrie Irving sharing an "anti-semetic" link on his Instagram page.</p><p>James wanted to know why.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Lebron James‚Äô statement on the Jerry Jones photo is worth the listen. <a href="https://t.co/tk690TYbEf">pic.twitter.com/tk690TYbEf</a><br />‚Äî Robert Griffin III (@RGIII) <a href="https://twitter.com/RGIII/status/1598312326544883713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>I was wondering why I haven‚Äôt gotten a question from you guys about the Jerry Jones photo, but when the Kyrie thing was going on, you guys were quick to access questions about that... and I know it was years and years ago, and we all make mistakes. I get it. ...  was just kind of disappointed. I haven‚Äôt received that question from you guys. </blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="8fe07" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32241758&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Let me say both controversies are equally stupid. And prime examples of why journalism is the least respected institution in America.</p><p>The Jerry Jones one is because two white progressive reporters wanted to virtue signal about the lack of black NFL coaches, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jerry-jones-photo-stephen-a" target="_blank">so they dug up a photo of the 80-year-old Jones when he was 15</a> and stood in the crowd as a group of African-American students entered a school and other white people protested. </p><p>The Kyrie Irving drama? He shared a link to a documentary that is available for purchase on Amazon that critics say is anti-semetic. And because <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-snl" target="_blank">it was so soon after the initial Ye drama</a>, reporters were in a frenzy. The media is also <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kyrie-irving-blasts-media-slandering" target="_blank">still angry at Kyrie that he stood up</a> for medical freedom, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/clay-travis-twitter-kyrie-irving" target="_blank">which was also a stupid controversy</a>. </p><p>As for why the media didn't ask Lebron about a sixty-five-year-old photo of a football coach but did ask him about one of his current basketball peers on the court? I'm guessing because LeBron plays basketball and not football.</p><p><p>

## Who is 'Cocaine Bear' and why is everyone on the internet including Elon Musk talking about him?

We all remember the late, great Sen. Tom Coburn exposing the coked-up stimulus monkeys. Instead, Cocaine Bear is a new movie -- based on real events -- coming to theaters in 2023. It stars Ray Liotta in his final role. Though, I'm guessing the star of <em>Goodfellas</em> and <em>Field of Dreams</em> wishes he squeezed one more out before passing.</p><p>Allow Cocaine Bear to introduce himself.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I'm the bear who ate cocaine. This is my story. <a href="https://t.co/txBSiUl5hL">pic.twitter.com/txBSiUl5hL</a><br />‚Äî Cocaine Bear (@cocainebear) <a href="https://twitter.com/cocainebear/status/1598013839202693120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Everyone is excited Cocaine Bear will finally have his story told.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Always wondered about that bear ‚Ä¶<br />‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1598225465642483713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>It also features the film debut of the guy who makes those funny TikToks about retail workers. You know, the ones you wait for someone to put in one big video they share on Instagram and Twitter. This guy.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="8ddcb" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32241572&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>The story of Cocaine Bear <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/3754621-cocaine-bear-set-for-2023-release/" target="_blank">begins in 1985</a> when a drug smuggler unloaded $15 million worth of cocaine over Chattahoochee National Forest because his plane was too heavy. A bear -- we'll call him C.B. -- confused the package for a picnic basket and went to town on all $15 million worth. Though C.B. swore to the other bears he didn't like cocaine. He only liked the smell.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="19495" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32241588&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>C.B. died of a massive overdose, as you would imagine one would after ingesting $15 million worth of coke. C.B. was taxidermized and later owned by Waylon Jennings. Which makes total sense.</p><p>That's the "based on true stories" part of the Elizabeth Banks movie. Where Cocaine Bear goes on a drug-fueled killing spree is Hollywood using its creative license.</p><p>If this will be the new Hollywood trend, I can think of a few other animal-centric "based on real events" that would make good movies. The monkey who <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/breaking-monkeys-attack-lab-assistant-escape-with-covid-samples-wait-what" target="_blank">stole the Schmovid samples</a> is one. The other monkeys <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/monkey-gang-warfare-thailand" target="_blank">who took over an entire city in Thailand</a> are another. But my personal favorite? The elephant who killed a woman, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elephant-woman-funeral" target="_blank">then showed up at her funeral to further send a message</a>.</p><p>If you'll excuse me, I'm going to open up Final Draft. There are screenplays to write.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Sorority reject, born without ladybits, is confused about how tampons work on day 12 of 'being a girl'

My question is: to what extent do I have to participate in your self-image?" On a totally unrelated note, here's a *sigh* girl -- who used to be a boy with all the factory standard parts - sharing their confusion on how <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tampax-tweet" target="_blank">tampons</a> work.</p><p>Another gem from citizen journalist Libs of TikTok.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Biological male who went viral this year for attempting to join a sorority is now learning from Dylan Mulvaney and creating tiktoks making a mockery of women. <a href="https://t.co/CFUCgzg5Xb">pic.twitter.com/CFUCgzg5Xb</a><br />‚Äî Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) <a href="https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1597799390613499904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p><em>‚ÄúThat just hangs out inside you?‚Äù</em></p><p><em>‚ÄúHow do you get it out?‚Äù </em></p><p><em>‚ÄúWhere does the string go?‚Äù</em></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>"But Brodigan, this seems like a troll. Are you sure we're not being trolled?" Who the f*ck knows.</p><p>The video comes from Grant Sikes. You may remember he/she/they/them from when every sorority in Alabama (roll tide) rejected - her(?) - from pledging. Being from the south, the sorority sisters have the antiquated belief that if you're born a guy you are not a girl.</p><p>This is where it gets confusing...because up until now everything made total sense. Grant was non-binary at the time, but the sorority incident outed them(?) as trans. Now Grant is stealing <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-ulta-biden" target="_blank">Dylan Mulvaney's schtick</a> -- someone else I thought was a parody until they met with Joe Biden -- and highlighting each day now that he's a girl. And much like Dylan, being a girl means acting as if you are a boy making fun of girls for social media clout. </p><p>Acting like how people who don't like women act when they impersonate women used to be considered "sexism." Now, it's "inclusion" and you are transphobic to say otherwise. It's double-secret transphobic if you are a woman who was born a woman saying otherwise. Deadname deez, you TERF!</p><p>Exit question: Grant, Dylan, and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shop-teacher-skydiving" target="_blank">Kayla Lemieux</a> all walk into a bar. The bartender says...? </p><p><p>
