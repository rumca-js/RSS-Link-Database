The patch both introduces Season 1 of Ranked Battles and addresses numerous bugs, including inconsistent music playback during key events.</p><p>The creature-collecting game routinely suffers from poor frame rates, particularly in busy areas like cities.

The feat made them the fastest-selling Nintendo game on any of the company's platforms. Japan's Pok\u00e9mon fandom played a major role, as domestic sales topped 4 million in those early days.</p><p>Those numbers also suggest Nintendo is still faring well against its biggest console rivals. Sony's fastest-selling PlayStation game, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-ps5-162534113.html\"><em>God of War: Ragnarok</em></a>, 'only' managed to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-fastest-selling-sony-exclusive-191147076.html\">move 5.1 million copies</a> during its first week. That's not completely shocking given the brutal brawler's narrower audience, and Sony is unlikely to complain much when third-party releases like the Call of Duty series routinely sell well.

It's said to take the AI just five seconds to apply the aging effects to a single frame.</p><p>Re-aging an actor is typically an expensive and laborious process that requires artists to go through a scene frame-by-frame to manually change the character's appearance. Attempts have been made in the past to automate the process with neural networks and machine learning. Disney's researchers note that, while they might work well for still images, other systems \"typically suffer from facial identity loss, poor resolution and unstable results across subsequent video frames.\" They claim their solution offers \"the first practical, fully-automatic and production-ready method for re-aging faces in video images.\"</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"e46dc2fd533841f0b0018c5369738e46\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>The team <a href=\"https://studios.disneyresearch.com/app/uploads/2022/10/Production-Ready-Face-Re-Aging-for-Visual-Effects.pdf\"><ins>wrote in a paper</ins></a> that it would be impossible to train the FRAN (face re-aging network) neural network on a dataset of real people. That would require pairs of images showing a subject with the same facial expression, pose, lighting and background at two different and known ages. Instead, the researchers created a database of several thousand randomly generated faces. They re-aged those synthetic faces using existing machine learning aging tools, then fed the results of that process into FRAN.</p><p>The neural network can analyze a headshot and predict which parts of a face would be affected by aging and then it applies effects like wrinkles or skin smoothing as a layer on top of the original face. As <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/disney-ai-art-vfx-visual-effects-de-age-younger-older-1849835548\"><em><ins>Gizmodo</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>notes, the researchers claim this approach allows FRAN to re-age the performer with their identity and appearance intact, even when their head or face is moving around or the lighting changes in a shot. Unlike with other methods, FRAN doesn't require an extra face alignment step either.</p><p>There are many good reasons why Disney would want to develop such a tool. It could lessen visual effects artists' workloads and speed up the process, for one thing. In addition to helping productions without blockbuster budgets age their actors up or down, it might help keep ballooning budgets in check. A significant chunk of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/the%20irishman/\"><em><ins>The Irishman</ins></em><ins>'s</ins></a> budget, which reports suggest was as much as $200 million, went toward making Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci look younger.</p><p>Disney has been de-aging performers in its own projects, notably with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lucasfilm-hires-shamook-054904077.html\"><ins>Mark Hamill in Star Wars</ins></a>. When Harrison Ford returns as Indiana Jones next summer, he'll also <a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/indiana-jones-5-opening-sequence-de-ages-harrison-ford-exclusive\"><ins>look a little younger</ins></a> than you're used to seeing him \u2014 at least for the opening sequence.

It comes with a USB-C port, similar to what you\u2019d find on a MacBook and many other non-iPhone devices, and while it\u2019s not a Thunderbolt connection as on theiPad Pro, simply being able to charge the Air with the same cable you use with your other gadgets is a plus.</p><p>Apple refreshed the Air earlier this year with its M1 system-on-a-chip, which is the same silicon found in the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html\">entry-level MacBook Air</a>.

Still, while it\u2019s not cheap, the iPad Air is Apple\u2019s best blend of price and performance for most.</p><h2>Best budget: iPad (9th generation)</h2><p></p><p>If you can\u2019t afford the Air, or if you just don\u2019t use your tablet heavily enough to warrant spending that much, it\u2019s perfectly safe to get <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlHOUZQSFk2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWF6LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlYmIzYTgxOC02NmIzLTQ2YmYtOThlMy0xNjYzOWFkODY5OGEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUF22cCdn1JWaK5PD7lksRVQhlNpm3JSYxsmfYeHxGVH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9FPHY6\">the 9th-gen iPad</a> instead. Starting at $329 for a 64GB model \u2014 and regularly available for less than $300 \u2014 it\u2019s by far the most wallet-friendly way into iPadOS. While its hardware is an obvious step down from the models above, it\u2019s still more than capable for the essentials.</p><p>We gave the 9th-gen iPad a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-9th-generation-review-143045685.html\">review score of 86</a> last year. This is the only \u201ccurrent\u201d iPad to follow Apple\u2019s older design language: It\u2019s just a tiny bit thicker and heavier than the 10th-gen iPad and iPad Air, but its wider bezels mean there\u2019s only enough room for a 10.2-inch display. Like the 10th-gen iPad, that screen isn't laminated and more susceptible to glare, though it\u2019s just as sharp. There\u2019s a Home button located on the bottom bezel that also houses a Touch ID fingerprint scanner, and the device charges via Lightning port rather than USB-C. Its speakers don\u2019t sound as nice, either, but it\u2019s the only iPad to still have a headphone jack, and its 12MP front camera is fine (though, it\u2019s not landscape-oriented as on the 10th-gen iPad).</p><p>The 9th-gen iPad runs on Apple\u2019s A13 Bionic, which is the same SoC used in 2019\u2019s iPhone 11 series. It won\u2019t be as fluid or futureproof as the M1, but it\u2019s plenty quick for casual tasks. In terms of first-party accessories, the tablet supports <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1TbWFydC1LZXlib2FyZC1pUGFkLUdlbmVyYXRpb24vZHAvQjA4NjNGNUtDVD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1hei0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZWJiM2E4MTgtNjZiMy00NmJmLTk4ZTMtMTY2MzlhZDg2OThhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXYw8oQvVKFZ4NI8LRX28wkGGjVEq-uvhPHZoGnigrs_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Smart-Keyboard-iPad-Generation%2Fdp%2FB0863F5KCT\">Apple's Smart Keyboard</a> and first-gen Pencil stylus. Those are less convenient than the company\u2019s newer options, but they\u2019re at least <em>there.</em></p><p>In the end, it\u2019s all about the price. The 9th-gen iPad is the most affordable model in Apple\u2019s lineup, and those savings go a long way toward papering over its issues.</p><h2>Best for one-handed use: iPad mini&nbsp;</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLUFwcGxlLWlQYWQtTWluaS1XaS1GaS9kcC9CMDlHOTFMWEZQP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWF6LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlYmIzYTgxOC02NmIzLTQ2YmYtOThlMy0xNjYzOWFkODY5OGEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdw4RzvX7d2QJshPEUWn7FkKluiQopCLiGCCJZqJnnjs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi%2Fdp%2FB09G91LXFP\">iPad mini</a> is exactly what it sounds like: the small iPad. It\u2019s easily the shortest (7.69x5.3x0.25 inches) and lightest (0.65 pounds for the WiFi model) of every current iPad, with an 8.3-inch display that\u2019s more comfortable to operate with one hand.</p><p>We gave the iPad mini a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-6th-generation-2021-review-130009170.html\">review score of 89</a> last year. Its design follows closely after that of the iPad Air: squared-off edges, thin bezels, no Home button, a Touch ID sensor in the power button, stereo speakers, solid cameras and a USB-C port. Its display is technically sharper, but otherwise gives you the same max brightness, lamination, anti-reflective coating and wide color gamut. It doesn\u2019t have a \u201c<a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLXVzL0hUMjA1MjM3IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlYmIzYTgxOC02NmIzLTQ2YmYtOThlMy0xNjYzOWFkODY5OGEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZJrmEU1Ew2Q4Yf7pctBPKR0nB5xo2y4vLm9Er86j1CF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2FHT205237\">Smart Connector</a>\u201d to hook up Apple-made keyboards, but it does support the second-gen Apple Pencil.</p><p>The mini runs on Apple\u2019s A15 Bionic SoC, the same as the one in 2021\u2019s iPhone 13 phones. This is technically faster than the chip inside the 10th-gen iPad and, again, more than powerful enough for most tasks, though it\u2019s a step behind the laptop-grade M1 or M2.</p><p>The mini has an MSRP of $499 for the 64GB model and $649 for the 256GB model. That\u2019s a lot, though in recent months we\u2019ve seen both SKUs available online for up to $100 less. If you specifically want a smaller tablet \u2014 whether it\u2019s to easily stuff in a bag, use with one hand or treat like a high-end e-reader \u2014 this is the only option Apple sells, and the best tablet in its size range, period.</p><h2>Best for power users: iPad Pro 12.9-inch</h2><p></p><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJKTEQ0U1dEP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWF6LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlYmIzYTgxOC02NmIzLTQ2YmYtOThlMy0xNjYzOWFkODY5OGEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZf6OnX7q5Hkdkk4akb4J3R6MKGZAwO_B1S1Fpo178o5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLD4SWD\">12.9-inch iPad Pro</a> exists in something of its own realm within Apple\u2019s tablet lineup. It starts at $1,099 for 128GB of storage, which is $100 more than the M1 MacBook Air. That\u2019s well beyond what anyone needs to pay to do the vast majority of iPad things, and quite a chunk of change for a platform that still has issues with laptop-style productivity. But the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is the best pure piece of tablet hardware that Apple makes.</p><p>We gave the latest iPad Pro a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2022-m2-review-140026198-140026510-140026377-140026181.html\">review score of 87</a> in November. The display here can get brighter than the Air\u2019s, and it has a 120 Hz refresh rate (the Air is limited to 60 Hz). The 12.9-inch Pro\u2019s display is <em>more</em> of an upgrade than the 11-inch model, though, as it\u2019s the only iPad to use mini-LED backlighting, which can deliver higher peak brightness, improved contrast and a generally more realistic image. Beyond that, the Pro runs on Apple\u2019s new M2 SoC, which isn\u2019t a huge upgrade over the M1 in real-world use but offers <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2022-preview-m2-chip-130006105.html\">more performance</a> overhead going forward.

With its latest refresh, it can now recognize when an Apple Pencil is hovering above the display and preview would-be inputs. There are more storage options, going all the way up to 2TB, with the 1TB and 2TB models doubling the RAM from 8GB to 16GB (at a super high cost). And it works with all of Apple\u2019s best accessories.</p><p>It\u2019s a powerhouse, and if you <em>do</em> want to use an iPad more heavily for work, the roomier display on the 12.9-inch Pro should make it the most amenable option for all-day, laptop-style use.

But <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cre-8-audio-nifty-keys-midi-controller-eurorack-synth-225730167.html\">Cre8Audio</a> seems to think that prices haven\u2019t come down fast enough. It has been setting the pace in an incredible race to the bottom \u2013 and I don\u2019t mean that as a bad thing.</p><p>In May, Cre8Audio announced the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cre-8-audios-east-beast-is-250-semi-modular-synth-superbooth-130153924.html\">East Beast</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cre8audio-west-pest-west-coast-semimodular-synth-130059730.html\">West Pest</a> \u2013 its first pair of self-contained synths for just $250. They\u2019re some of the cheapest analog semi-modular synths that I\u2019m aware of, save for the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-17-korg-volca-modular-west-coast-synth-review-weird-affordable.html\">Korg Volca Modular</a>, which is sort of a weird dead end on the synth family tree.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>What they share</h2><div id=\"cca5ca0c7e124c07b670b4bf2949dae5\"></div><p>Unsurprisingly, the East Beast and West Pest have a lot in common. The basic chassis is the same, both have a 20-point patchbay, a 32-step sequencer, an arpeggiator, a one-octave keyboard, an LFO and a digital multi-mod tool. Even the core oscillator is very similar, with the West Pest having most of the same waveshapes and a slightly \u201cbuzzier\u201d tone. It\u2019s the rest of the sound-shaping modules that set the two apart from each other, with the East Beast and West Pest predictably leaning into East Coast and West Coast synth styles, respectively.</p><p>The build quality on both is about what you\u2019d expect from something at this price point. There\u2019s a lot of plastic and don\u2019t seem like they\u2019re designed with the rigors of your life in mind. They don\u2019t feel cheap or toy-like, though; they just feel like what they are: entry level synthesizers. The larger knobs are easier to handle than the tiny ones on a Volca and the overall package feels a touch more robust than an IK Multimedia <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/uno-synth-pro-review-ik-multimedia-shows-its-serious-about-hardware-120008688.html\">Uno</a>. They\u2019re also a lot more fun looking than those instruments. I know that the almost comicbook-esque aesthetic here won\u2019t be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but I quite enjoy it. It\u2019s playful and a bit silly, and let\u2019s not forget \u2013 synths should be fun.</p><figure><img alt=\"Cre8Audio East Beast &amp; West Pest\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/276d6b90-7178-11ed-bbfd-4cb9dcb8520d\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The keyboard is a welcome inclusion, perfect for auditioning patches or punching in sequences and arps. But, like the one on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/moog-mavis-diy-semi-modular-synth-review-160024467.html\">Moog\u2019s Mavis</a>, I wouldn\u2019t want to actually rely on it for performance. The keys are small and a little wobbly. Plus most of the keys have two additional shift functions for controlling various features.</p><p>Honestly, the better bet is to use an external controller and set the built-in keyboard to default to the yellow / green functions instead. This is made easier by the fact that both the East Beast and West Pest have MIDI inputs and MIDI to CV converters for controlling other parameters. That\u2019s not unheard of on a budget semi-modular synth, but it\u2019s not a given either. Even some of Moog\u2019s more expensive instruments like the DFAM don\u2019t have MIDI support. I will make one minor note here though, MIDI notes were quite a few octaves higher than expected straight out of the box and I was initially a bit confused until I found the instructions for changing the octave offset in the manual.</p><p>One of the more unique shared features is the digital multi-mod tool. Since they only have one LFO and one envelope generator (or \u201cdynamics section\u201d in the case of the West Pest), this gives the instruments an extra set of controls to draw on. This can be an additional LFO, envelope, random generator or MIDI-to-CV output. There are some limitations, for instance you can only map a single MIDI CC, and the envelope is a simple decay envelope with seven preset rates, but it\u2019s a nice addition nonetheless.</p><section><img alt=\"Cre8Audio East Beast &amp; West Pest\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/27853950-7178-11ed-bcbd-72201c0adc7b\" /></section><p>It\u2019s a similar story with the sequencer and arpeggiator. They get the job done, and I\u2019m glad they\u2019re here, but both are pretty basic. The arpeggiator only has two modes \u2013 as played and random. While the sequencer can be 32 steps, you basically just add notes to the end until you\u2019re happy with it. If you make a mistake your only option is to clear the whole thing and start over.</p><p>While dialing in basic sounds and patches is pretty straightforward, there are a bunch of options and features hidden behind those shift functions. And navigating them isn\u2019t always intuitive. Obviously, I\u2019m not expecting a giant display with detailed graphics on a $250 synth, but the \u201c4-bit display\u201d (read: four LEDs in a line) can feel arcane at times. I\u2019ve had both for over a month now and I still have to refer to the manual to remember that the first two LEDs mean I\u2019m dividing the clock by two for the LFO; or that the first, third and fourth lights mean I\u2019ve set the swing to 64 percent. This is obviously not a deal-breaker by any means. But if you\u2019re the type of person who proudly refuses to read manuals you might feel frustrated at times.</p><h2>East Beast</h2><figure><img alt=\"Cre8Audio East Beast &amp; West Pest\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/276d4480-7178-11ed-bfdf-a35a5fd37fea\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Let\u2019s dig into the more \u201cnormal\u201d of the two instruments. This is probably what most people envision when they think of a synthesizer. A big rich oscillator, a filter for shaving off harmonics and an ADSR envelope for controlling amplitude. While this doesn\u2019t really sound like a Moog, it clearly shares a similar lineage.</p><p>The multi-mode filter and oscillator are straight from boutique synth makers Pittsburgh Modular which gives this decidedly budget affair some serious street cred. The oscillator has sine, triangle, saw and square waves, and you can combine two of them to deliver thicker, more unique sounds when needed. It\u2019s something that Pittsburgh Modular has been perfecting for around 10 years. It does sound pretty massive.</p><p>Being a mono synth, you\u2019re not gonna get compelling pads out of the East Beast, but it shines as a lead and bass machine. It can do big room shaking low end, thick creamy solos and delicate high-end plucks. It even has pulse width modulation for the square wave, which gets you wonderful video game noises, and FM for harsher, more bell-like tones. I actually think it\u2019s at its best playing softer leads, using the filter to shave off a lot of the high end.</p><section><img alt=\"Cre8Audio East Beast &amp; West Pest\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/276d4481-7178-11ed-bdff-145455ff359b\" /></section><p>The filter is probably the star of the show, by the way. Often it\u2019s what brings the most character to the sound of a synth, and this one delivers. It\u2019s variable state, going from low pass, to band pass to high pass. But it can also combine those in interesting ways. It does acid bass lines and nasal reedy sounds. There\u2019s a reason the filter cutoff knob is about four times larger than all the other controls on the front panel: It\u2019s probably the most powerful tool here for shaping your sound.</p><p>Both Cre8Audio and Pittsburgh Modular like to brag that this unique filter has \u201cno dead spots\u201d, that it\u2019s really \u201call one large sweet spot\u201d, and you know what, they\u2019re probably right. I had a real hard time making this filter sound bad. No matter how much you crank the resonance, in every mode, even with the filter mod set to ludicrous levels, it\u2019s surprisingly musical. It doesn\u2019t self-oscillate, which might be a bummer for some, but it doesn\u2019t bother me too much.</p><h2>West Pest</h2><figure><img alt=\"Cre8Audio East Beast &amp; West Pest\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/27858770-7178-11ed-b1ff-e3f103b28097\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The West Pest is sort of like the East Beast\u2019s hippy cousin. It\u2019s a tad strange, and has to do everything a little differently, but it\u2019s no less compelling \u2013 just a bit tougher to tame. It has many of the same features and a very similar oscillator, but it trades the variable state filter and ADSR envelope for a lowpass gate and adds a wave folder.</p><p>I\u2019d venture to say that, similar to the East Beast, the Pest is most comfortable with bass and plucky leads. But the timbre is completely different. It\u2019s more aggressive and sharp, trading in the creamy goodness of its counterpart for the plasticky weirdness more often associated with Buchla synths.</p><p>Because it travels in less familiar territory, it can feel a little harder to make work in an arrangement. But, it can be a more satisfying solo instrument. Both synths have robust randomization features, including randomly cycling through oscillator waveforms and generative sequencing capabilities, but those feel more at home on the West Pest.</p><figure><img alt=\"Cre8Audio East Beast &amp; West Pest\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/2787aa50-7178-11ed-bf57-29441fea0120\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Setting the digital mod tool to random, and connecting it to the release mod jack will alter how long notes ring out. Then using the random pattern generator with morphing will play a continuously evolving sequence. And then you can get the oscillator wave to change for every note, giving you something truly unpredictable. Feed that through an epic reverb pedal and you\u2019ve got a custom, soothing soundtrack for working or reading to.</p><p>Yes, you could accomplish a similar thing with the East Beast since it has most of the same randomization tools (save the release mod), and it\u2019s probably the more versatile instrument, but I find the results on the West Pest more pleasing. And, honestly, this is one of the ways I often use synths in my studio \u2013 passively as a sort of fidget toy or to set a mood while I plug away on editing articles for Engadget.</p><h2>With other gear</h2><section><img alt=\"Cre8Audio East Beast &amp; West Pest\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/2756fd60-7178-11ed-bfff-2169f00f8683\" /></section><p>The one thing I will say is that the West Pest does need a little external help to shine, more so than the East Beast. Its rubbery bass sounds are pretty usable on their own, but once you start getting into the higher frequencies, reverb and delay become a must.</p><p>But what you\u2019re probably more interested in is how they interact with other modular gear. The 20-point patchbay makes it simple to integrate into a larger Eurorack (or compatible) setup \u2013 whether these are your gateway drug or just the latest symptom of your incurable GAS (gear acquisition syndrome).</p><figure><img alt=\"Cre8Audio East Beast &amp; West Pest\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/2794a2a0-7178-11ed-879e-72b21476feef\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>I would say the patchbay is probably where you make the most trade-offs here, though. While there are indeed 20 patch points (evenly divided between ins and outs), four of them are dedicated to MIDI functions and one is the audio output. So that leaves 15 points for internal patching. Now, that both of these act as a MIDI to CV interface is extremely useful, and can simplify controlling other gear that isn\u2019t MIDI compatible. For instance, you could feed MIDI from your computer to the West Pest then pass those controls on as CV to something like Moog\u2019s Mavis. But it does eat into the options available to you for sound design on board.</p><p>It would be great to have access to the LFO rate or resonance level on the patch bay, for example. Or to have a few utilities like a mult. Cre8Audio crams a lot of versatility into the patchbay, through the multi mod tool, which gives you an extra envelope, LFO or a random generator, though it also has limitations. There\u2019s enough power here to get you exploring the basics of patch design, but you\u2019ll probably start wishing for a few more ins and outs sooner than later.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><section><img alt=\"Cre8Audio East Beast &amp; West Pest\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/27a40bf0-7178-11ed-bfaf-da64e763376a\" /></section><p>The East Beast and West Pest are both undeniably impressive values. At this price point there\u2019s simply nothing like them on the market. They are usable and musical semi modular synths with unique and compelling features. What\u2019s more they\u2019re easy to integrate with other modular gear, and you can even take them out of their cases and mount them in a larger Eurorack set up. They\u2019re near ideal choices for someone that\u2019s looking to learn synthesis.</p><p>That is different from saying they\u2019re an ideal first synth, full stop. If you\u2019re just looking to pull up some great sounding presets and get on with your day, these are not for you. Cre8Audio\u2019s instruments demand exploration and experimentation. And recalling a patch will require you to take copious notes.

The 12.9-inch model on sale attaches magnetically to the back of the iPad Pro, keeping the tablet \"hovering\" above and slightly behind the keys and trackpad. The accessory feeds data to the iPad via the rear smart connector, and that also means that you don't have to worry about charging it separately or pairing it via Bluetooth to the tablet like you would with many other third-party keyboards. We found the Magic Keyboard to be pretty sturdy, and it provides an excellent typing experience. Somewhat surprisingly, the trackpad wasn't as cumbersome to scroll with as we thought it might be (since it's much wider than it is tall) and it provides much more precise control than you'd ever get with the iPad's touchscreen alone.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Overall, the Magic Keyboard is one of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-ipad-accessories-130018595.html\">best iPad accessories</a> if you really want to get work done on your iPad Pro.

The Magic Keyboard provides limited range of motion for the iPad \u2014 roughly 90 to 130 degrees \u2014 which is much less than you'd get from a standard laptop. It's also not the slimmest solution and, while it gets close to replicating the feeling of working on a laptop, it's not exactly the same.

As we <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-review-small-hands-180026719.html\">said in our review</a>, it's worth having around even if you just play it a few times a month for a couple hours at a time. But I wound up using mine a little differently: I play the Steam Deck several times a day for just a few minutes per session.</p><p>And it's almost the only reason I play video games at all anymore.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>I'm no less interested in games than I used to be, but since becoming a father, I've found I have a lot less time. For the first year of my daughter's life, setting aside an hour to play a game felt impossible. Then, <em>Metroid Dread</em> came out, and I found myself using the Nintendo Switch's sleep mode in short bursts. 5 minutes while the baby played with a new toy. 10 minutes as I waited for her to fall asleep.</p><figure><img alt=\"Valve Steam Deck on a stand\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/9b442a20-70e9-11ed-9fff-40645b7212ab\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sean Buckley/Engadget</div></figure><p>As I chipped away at <em>Metroid Dread\u2019s</em> short 10-hour story, I found myself thinking about the Steam Deck. Not only was Valve\u2019s gaming handheld a portable gaming system like the Switch, but it promised to give my Steam library something I had never experienced from PC gaming before: the ability to quickly suspend and resume a game. It\u2019s a standard quality of life feature on home consoles, but trying to resume a game after putting a PC to sleep is hit or miss.</p><p>When my Steam Deck arrived four months later and the feature actually worked, it changed everything. I spent my first day with the handheld slowly playing through the Deck\u2019s showcase demo: Valve\u2019s <em>Desk Job</em>, casually picking the handheld up for just 5 minutes every few hours. When that worked, I got more ambitious \u2014 finishing <em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</em> over the course of two weeks.</p><p>I started using the Steam Deck to play games in the margins of my day. Picking it up for a few random battles in <em>Final Fantasy IV</em> after the baby fell asleep on my chest, doing a deep space cargo run in <em>Rebel Galaxy Outlaw</em> as I watched her nap on the baby monitor, or sneaking in a few puzzles in <em>Baba is You</em> before turning in for the night. Suddenly I was finishing games I never thought I would have time for.</p><p>The suspend trick even works with non-Steam games and older titles: I spent hours experimenting in <em>Lutris</em>, an alternative Linux game launcher, getting the year 2000\u2019s <em>Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force</em> to run smoothly on Steam Deck. A week or two later, I finally finished a game I abandoned when I was 16 years old.</p><figure><img alt=\"Valve Steam Deck\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/24519d20-70ea-11ed-99cf-7cfad8e52522\" style=\"height: 984; width: 1750;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p>That isn't to say I haven't had longer play sessions on Steam Deck. Online-only games like <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> or <em>Knockout Cit</em>y tend to disconnect the player when thrown into suspend mode \u2014 but I often still prefer playing them on Valve's portable than on my big gaming desktop. Yes, an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X with 64GB of RAM and a GTX 980 GPU can soundly outperform the Deck\u2019s custom AMD APU. It runs games at higher resolution with better graphic settings, but it\u2019s wasted power.</p><p>I've grown to love having my library of PC games detached from the writing and video editing workstation that lives at my desk. You might say that\u2019s what more powerful traditional game consoles are for, but the Deck\u2019s Switch-like portability makes all the difference. Playing games on the couch, in bed, or while rocking the baby to sleep beats out having maxed out graphics settings every time. I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019m going to upgrade that aging graphics card anymore. The Steam Deck may be less powerful, but at today\u2019s GPU prices, it\u2019s a far better value.</p><div id=\"8744014a01764d1b9220e905690eca56\"></div><p>Not all of my games work smoothly on Steam Deck, but it turns out that's a plus for me as well. I love tinkering with gadgets and fiddling around with power user settings. So when I\u2019m forced to drop into the Deck\u2019s desktop mode to manually install a non-Steam game, which inevitably involves configuring alternative Wine compatibility layers, I enjoy the challenge almost as much as the game I\u2019ll eventually play.  And when I do get those games running, they almost always work with Steam OS' suspend and resume feature.</p><p>It feels a little silly to laud the Steam Deck for what\u2019s an otherwise standard feature on most modern gaming devices, but I can\u2019t help it. Sometimes one good feature can change everything. Before the Steam Deck, playing a game from my PC library was a chore that required sitting at a desk, booting up Windows, launching Steam and, finally, loading up a game. When you might only have minutes of free time during an entire day, that simply doesn\u2019t work. Add in the possibility that a crying baby might call you away from that hard-earned game session at a moment\u2019s notice, and you can start to see the appeal of a gaming device you can take anywhere, one that lets you instantly stop and start a high-end PC game with the touch of a single button.</p><figure><img alt=\"Valve Steam Deck\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/24519d20-70ea-11ed-bdfe-7ed9d3b43b27\" style=\"height: 984; width: 1750;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p>Suspend and resume had a rough start on the Xbox One and PS4, but eventually they became kind of an expected fare. Even so, it\u2019s a killer feature that PC gamers have largely been missing out on. I never really appreciated how much of a game changer it could be until I really needed it. The Steam Deck brings that feature to the PC crowd in a natural, user-friendly package that we\u2019ve never had before. And being a portable system is just the icing on the cake. The Steam Deck is certainly pricey, but being able to catch up on PC games with a baby in my arms is priceless.</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apples-2022-ipad-30-off-amazon-123551194.html?src=rss", "title": "Apple's 2022 iPad is $30 off right now", "date_published": "2022-12-01 12:35:51+00:00", "description": "<p>If you weren't able to grab <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9zdG9yZXMvcGFnZS9wcmV2aWV3P2lzU2xwPTEmaXNQcmV2aWV3PTEmYXNpbnM9QjBCSkxYTVZNViUyQ0IwQkpMQ1dGTk0mdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tYXYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU3N2U5YTkzLTNhYTctNGM2MC04YjIxLTg0ZmFlNmQ1NWIxMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARICnMPWrBx6-WvsIp2mbD-T1iw9563aFpXFlkeRaMd5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2Fpreview%3FisSlp%3D1%26isPreview%3D1%26asins%3DB0BJLXMVMV%2CB0BJLCWFNM\">Apple's 2022 iPad</a> on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-black-friday-apple-deals-on-ipads-macbooks-airpods-and-more-123050079.html\">Black Friday</a>, don't worry: It's on sale right now for an even cheaper price.

To be eligible, you'll have to be watching the event on <a href=\"https://steam.tv/\">Steam TV</a>, which starts at 7:30PM ET, and you'll have to register on the <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/sale/thegameawardssteamdeckdrop2022\">giveaway's official page</a> beforehand to enter the drawing.&nbsp;</p><p>One factor that could potentially prevent you from joining the draw is your location: You can only register and win if you're in the US, Canada, UK or the EU, where the console is currently available for sale. In addition, you must have made a Steam purchase between November 14th, 2021 and November 14th, 2022 to verify your country and prove that your account is not limited and is in good standing. Valve will draw a random name from the pool of registrants every minute during the event and will be announcing winners in chat as each drawing takes place. To note, the show is expected to run for around two-and-a-half hours, so that's over a hundred Steam Decks to be won.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The 2022 Game Awards will not only stream online but will also offer a live \"IMAX Experience\" in select cities in the US, Canada and other regions.
