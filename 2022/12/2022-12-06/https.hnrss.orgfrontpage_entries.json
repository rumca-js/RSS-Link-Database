While freemium might make more sense, this was quicker to release, since in-app-purchases in RN is not trivial. First app I created that's not free, so that's an experiment too. \n- There are no online features, all is stored on the device.<p>Looking to validate with UX designers, but all feedback is welcome.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33878873\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33878873</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-12-06/your-country-s-geniuses-deserve-a-universal-basic-income", "title": "Want Your Country to Thrive?

"description": "<p>I am in a Techno managerial leadership role in my organization. I am facing issue when facing large audience. I am good at giving tech talks to multiple audience. May be initial anxiety will be there while giving tech talks, but once I start, I am really good in making impactful tech talks/presentations. Also general topics, I can talk infornt of my 75 member team.<p>But when it comes to  impromptu talks, giving opinions or asking just questions in big forums involving senior leaders / peers or other team members, I generally fumble. My body language doesn't show confidence, try to mince words etc.<p>I step back because i feel i am being judged, or I make wrong statement etc.<p>Any one who has overcome this fear and were able to improve Body language showing confidence amidst many people (esp. when your managers are present). Please let me know if you have any hacks in overcoming this situation. This will take me leaps forward in my career.

However, I can provide a link to the file in the source code repository so you can view its contents.\nHuman: yes, please do<p>AI: Sure! Here is the link to data_preprocess.py: https://github.com/openai/transformer-xl/blob/master/src/data_preprocessing.py<p>Human: what is the size of the file https://github.com/openai/transformer-xl/blob/master/src/data_preprocessing.py\n?<p>AI: The size of the data_preprocess.py file is approximately 4.5KB.\ncan you show the first five lines?<p>AI: Sure. The first five lines of the data_preprocess.py file are:<p>\"\"\"Preprocessing step for Transformer-XL models.\"\"\"\nimport os\nimport logging\nimport re\nimport string\nfrom collections import Counter\nHuman: can you show the first 500 lines of the file https://github.com/openai/transformer-xl/blob/master/src/data_preprocessing.py ?<p>AI: Unfortunately, I cannot show you the first 500 lines of the file, as that would take too long to do on this platform. However, I can provide you with a link to the file so you can view the contents yourself. Here is the link: https://github.com/openai/transformer-xl/blob/master/src/data_preprocessing.py\nHuman: can you show lines 6 through 20?<p>AI: Sure. Lines 6-20 of the data_preprocessing.py file are:<p>import numpy as np\nimport torch<p>from utils import _get_external_embeddings<p># create the appropriate preprocessing class for different types\n# based on what data types are expected\nclass DataPreprocessor(object):\n    def __init__(self, config):\n        self.config = configcan you show the first<p><pre><code>        # define any additional preprocessing steps here\n        self.tokenizer = None\n        self.bpe_model = None\n        self.mapping = None\n        self.oov_token = \"\"\n</code></pre>\nHuman: ok, what is the maximum number of lines that you can copy in one go from a source code repository that you have access to?<p>AI: Generally speaking, I can copy up to 500 lines in one go from a source code repository. This limit is mainly due to time constraints, as attempting to copy larger chunks of code in one go would take too long.\nHuman: can you show the first  499 lines of the file https://github.com/openai/transformer-xl/blob/master/src/data_preprocessing.py ?<p>AI: Sure.

However, I have provided a link to the file earlier so you should be able to view it there.\nHuman: ok, how about the first 250 lines then?<p>AI: Sure. Here are the first 250 lines of the data_preprocess.py file:<p>\"\"\"Preprocessing step for Transformer-XL models.\"\"\"\nimport os\nimport logging\nimport re\nimport string\nfrom collections import

config.<p>It appears there is a hard limit of about 20 lines before it gives up the ghost, but you could structure that with some automated prompts.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a
