As one of their friends goes outside for a smoke, the video shows how certain voice commands will trigger actions within the game. “Hey zombie,” for example, draws the attention of the nearest undead.

## Apple's future iPhones and Macs will use TSMC chips made in Arizona

<p>You didn't have to wait long for confirmation of Apple's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-us-made-chips-2024-053927685.html">domestic chip plans</a>. Company chief Tim Cook has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/06/tim-cook-says-apple-will-use-chips-built-in-the-us-at-arizona-factory.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_content=Main&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1670358338">revealed</a> that Apple will <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/12/06/press-gaggle-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-and-national-economic-council-director-brian-deese-en-route-phoenix-arizona/">buy chips</a> made at TSMC's upcoming factory in Phoenix, Arizona. While Cook didn't say just how those chips will be used, the 4- and 3-nanometer parts are expected to find their way into next-generation iPhones, Macs and other key products. Apple is currently TSMC's largest customer.</p><p>The Phoenix facility is expected to start production in 2024. A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tsmc-arizona-investment-40-billion-semiconductor-plant-135339516.html">follow-up plant</a> is expected in 2026 due to increased demand. Combined, they'll make about 600,000 chip wafers per year. TSMC is spending $40 billion on the factories, but they'll be partly subsidized by the government through the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-signs-chips-and-science-act-145820799.html">CHIPS and Science Act</a> meant to incentivize US semiconductor manufacturing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Intel is also building factories in Arizona and Ohio. It's planning to serve as a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-plans-to-build-chips-for-qualcomm-and-amazon-065537348.html">foundry for other companies</a> looking to outsource chip production, and has expressed interest in making Apple's components. Whether or not that happens may depend on Intel's ability to keep up with foundries like TSMC, which frequently leads the push towards next-generation chip manufacturing processes.</p><p>The output will represent just a tiny portion of TSMC's total capabilities. <em>CNBC</em> notes the Taiwan firm made 12 million wafers in 2020 alone. The National Economic Council estimates that should be enough to fulfill US demand, though. That could alleviate <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-tsmc-confirm-japan-factory-chip-shortage-153515725.html">chip shortages</a>, create jobs and reduce American dependence on foreign production.</p><p>While the plants won't come online for two years, news of the expansion comes at an appropriate time. Apple has warned of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-expects-iphone-14-shipments-to-be-delayed-by-covid-restrictions-in-china-061204861.html">iPhone 14 Pro manufacturing setbacks</a> due to China's COVID-19 policies. In theory, American facilities would have reduced the impact of those restrictions. Although many parts could still be made overseas even after TSMC's expansion, there could soon be a greater chance of Apple devices reaching your door in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>Apple is expanding developers’ options for pricing their App Store apps.

Additionally, devs can now set regional costs automatically in response to exchange rates.</p><p>The App Store’s new structure lets developers choose from 900 price points for their apps, nearly 10 times what was previously available.

(If you’re old enough to remember the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-08-05-i-am-rich-makes-author-exactly-that-does-little-else.html">I Am Rich app</a>, you can imagine that developer salivating over this higher cap.) Additionally, app prices can now go up incrementally across different ranges. For example, they can now increase every $0.10 up to $10, every $0.50 between $10 and $50 and so on.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple is also adding different pricing conventions for all 175 regional storefronts. Deves can now use two repeating digits (like ₩110,000) and rounded dollar amounts ($10.00 instead of $9.99).</p><p>The update also makes it easier for devs to deal with global exchange rates. Apple uses the example of a Japanese game developer who gets most of their business from Japanese customers. Now they can set their price for the Japan storefront and see global pricing change automatically based on exchange and tax rates. Previously, developers had to do that manually.</p><p>Apple says the new pricing structure is available today for apps offering auto-renewable subscriptions. They will arrive for all other apps and in-app purchases in the spring of 2023.</p>

## Polestar 2 gets a 68HP power boost through a paid update, no subscription required

<p>Polestar is delivering a not-so-subtle snub to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-acceleration-increase-ev-subscription-230058550.html">Mercedes' subscription performance upgrade</a>. The automaker   has <a href="https://media.polestar.com/us/en/media/pressreleases/662265">released</a> an update that gives the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-polestar-2-is-a-sporty-ev-fastback-with-allnew-android-automotive-140040133.html">Polestar 2's</a> long range dual motor variant a 68HP power boost (plus 15lb. ft. of torque) in the US and Canada for a one-time $1,195 fee. That's far from a trivial expense, but it's a decidedly better value than Merc's $1,200 annual fee for EQS and EQE acceleration improvements.</p><p>The software tuning gives the Polestar 2 a total 476HP with 502lb. ft. of torque. That's enough to cut the 0-60MPH time to 4.2 seconds (normally 4.5), and it shaves half a second off the 50-70MPH dash (now 2.2 seconds). Polestar says you'll mainly notice the added grunt in the 44MPH to 80MPH range, so this update may be most helpful when you're overtaking someone on the highway.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can buy the update through the <a href="https://www.polestar-shop.com/">Polestar web shop</a>, and it will apply over the air. It's included with a new vehicle if you opt for the $5,000 Performance pack. You won't have to visit a store, then. There's no word of a comparable upgrade for the single motor Polestar 2 variant, or availability in other regions.</p><p>The patch won't suddenly give the Polestar 2 an edge over the Model 3 Performance (0-60 in 3.3 seconds) or other particularly quick EVs. And while this is a one-off purchase, you're still paying for something your car could technically handle before — it just wasn't available when the sedan was new. You're ultimately compensating Polestar for development time, not components, and this won't be thrilling if you preferred the days when paid upgrades were directly connected to better hardware.</p><p>This does make the Polestar 2 easier to justify if you crave speed, though. And importantly, you won't have to buy the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-bst-edition-270-production-142050295.html">extremely rare BST edition 270</a> just to get additional output. While you won't get as many track-ready features, you also won't have to receive an invitation (or, more likely, buy a used model at a premium) to get behind the wheel.</p>

The $2 <em>Legacy of Moonspell</em> expansion launches on PC via Steam and Xbox on December 15th.</p><p>The new content includes a new map that developer poncle describes as the game’s “biggest stage yet.” The new level, Mt. Moonspell, adds an abandoned castle, a snow-covered mountain and a Yokai-infested village. Additionally, the DLC adds over a dozen new weapons, including an ancestral wind force, orbs that unleash the power of seasons, a dark summoning weapon and an enchanted kimono. It also adds eight extra playable characters and six music tracks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“In eastern lands, a clan has fallen,” the DLC’s story description reads. “The Moonspell, once vigilant guardians of a sorcerous valley nestled in the mountains, have been overrun by hordes of yokai and oni.

If not, at least it’ll be entertaining to defeat thousands of wayward spirits in the process.”</p><figure><img alt="Gameplay still from 'Vampire Survivors: Legacy of Moonspell' DLC." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/2c2cabf0-7597-11ed-9ebd-5360919b466c" style="height: 800; width: 1280;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Luca Galante</div></figure><p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> is a casual game that, over time, reveals more complexity than you’d expect from its simple 2D character sprites.

## Apple's rumored electric car may not be fully self-driving after all

<p>Apple isn't done scaling back its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-first-electric-car-full-self-driving-181011414.html">plans for an electric car</a>, apparently. <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-06/apple-scales-back-self-driving-car-and-delays-launch-until-2026?sref=10lNAhZ9">sources</a> say the EV, codenamed Project Titan, is no longer a fully self-driving machine. It will reportedly have a conventional wheel and pedals, and will 'only' drive itself on highways. The company has also pushed the launch back by a year to 2026, the tipsters claim.</p><p>The rumored vehicle will supposedly offer enough autonomy that you can play games or watch video on the highway, but ask you to take control when it's time to drive on city streets or through adverse weather. Apple may debut the hands-free tech in North America at first and expand access "over time," the insiders add.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple has already declined comment. Titan has been in development <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-27-take-a-look-at-apples-self-driving-test-vehicle.html">for years</a>, and has suffered numerous setbacks as well as major strategy shifts. The tech firm may have had doubts as early as 2015, and was said to have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-17-bloomberg-apple-isnt-building-a-car-anymore.html">scuttled the vehicle in 2016</a> in favor of a licensed self-driving platform. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-appoints-kevin-lynch-car-division-223033138.html">Executive shuffles</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-27-apple-officially-lays-off-self-driving-car-workers.html">layoffs</a> didn't help, either. While the company did return to making a full-fledged vehicle, according to rumors, it had little success courting production help from brands <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-car-hyundai-010548978.html">like Hyundai</a>.</p><p>More modest ambitions wouldn't be surprising. Full Level 5 autonomy (where a vehicle can drive itself in any circumstance) still isn't a practical reality, and even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-fully-driverless-rides-san-francisco-094718022.html">Waymo's robotaxis</a> are only allowed to operate in good weather in California. There's also the question of legal permissions. While states are increasingly receptive to self-driving cars, there isn't yet a framework that would let the general public use completely autonomous vehicles. Even if Apple solved all the technical challenges, it couldn't realistically sell a truly hands-off car any time soon.</p><p>A switch to a semi-autonomous design could lead to fiercer competition. While Tesla has long been considered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-hires-tesla-director-of-autopilot-software-104848566.html">Apple's main rival</a>, the EV market has grown rapidly in recent years. Brands like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fords-mach-e-is-a-stylish-and-capable-ev-but-its-no-mustang-153044259.html">Ford</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-ioniq-first-drive-180018819.html">Hyundai</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html">Volkswagen</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1s-suv-ev-review-video-160029394.html">Rivian</a> have all made capable electric rides.

<p>The European Commission and Amazon have reportedly come to an agreement that will allow the retail giant to avoid a fine for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-amazon-antitrust-third-party-data-114513778.html"><ins>allegedly misusing seller data</ins></a>. According to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/86ae600a-0000-420c-b193-ba2bc60f6f03"><em><ins>The</ins></em><ins>&nbsp;</ins><em><ins>Financial Times</ins></em></a>, the company has pledged to give rival products equal treatment in the Buy Box section of its website, a move that should theoretically increase the visibility of the merchants selling those goods. Amazon also agreed to create alternate featured offers for customers less concerned about getting their purchase as quickly as possible, as well as give sellers free rein to decide on the company they want to deliver their goods.</p><p>According to <em>The Times</em>, the European Commission plans to announce the agreement on December 20th, though that date could shift. What won’t change are the terms of the deal. “There’s very little to discuss,” a source told the outlet. Once the agreement is formalized, Amazon will be required to honor its commitments for at least five years.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon did not immediately respond to Engadget’s comment request. In July, when the company promised it would take steps to make its seller program fairer, Amazon said it felt it was being “unfairly” targeted by legislation like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-digital-markets-services-acts-131818075.html"><ins>Digital Markets Act</ins></a>. At the same time, the retailer said it was "engaged constructively" with regulators to address concerns about its business.</p><p>A deal with the European Union would give Amazon the chance to put to rest at least one aspect of a long saga. The European Commission began probing the company’s use of merchant data in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-17-eu-amazon-probe-merchant-data-sensitive-advantage.html"><ins>2019</ins></a>, almost a full year before <em>The Wall Street Journal</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-used-seller-data-for-competing-products-180533964.html"><ins>published a report</ins></a> alleging that Amazon had used seller data to design competing products.

In April, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sec-amazon-third-party-seller-data-053518981.html"><ins>Securities and Exchange Commission</ins></a> reportedly began investigating the company’s use of third-party data.

<p>CD Projekt Red is shutting down <em>The Witcher: Monster Slayer</em>, its <em>Pokémon Go</em>-style mobile title released last year. The game will start <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/en/monster-slayer/news/46946/the-closing-of-the-witcher-monster-slayer">winding down</a> at the end of January before going offline for good at the end of June.</p><p>Unfortunately, that will also mean layoffs. As detailed in a <a href="https://support.spokko.com/hc/en-us/articles/8941529318546-FAQ">FAQ</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-monster-slayer-is-shutting-down-in-2023-with-lay-offs-expected"><em>IGN</em></a>), some developers at Spokko (the publisher’s mobile-gaming studio launched in 2018) who worked on the game won’t be staying. The publisher says it’s rolling Spokko into CD Projekt Red with only some staff making that transition.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The publisher will remove <em>The Witcher: Monster Slayer</em> from the App Store and Google Play on January 31st, 2023. It will also turn off in-game purchases and stop adding new content that day. Servers will remain up for existing players until June 30th.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-witcher-monster-slayer-073011299.html">Announced</a> several months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the mobile monster-slaying game seemed like a fair bet. With gamers antsy from a seemingly endless quarantine, a geocaching-inspired adventure requiring <em>Witcher</em> fans to go out into the real world (while still praciticing social distancing) could have captured the mood of the moment. But that never fully transpired as the title didn’t launch until the following summer when vaccination rates were rising, and life began regaining a semblance of normality. Whether you can trace the game’s shutdown to pandemic-related timing or not, CD Projekt Red admits it “did not reach our business expectations.”</p><p>CD Project Red recently announced a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cd-project-red-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-the-witcher-new-trilogy-165530632.html">long-term roadmap</a>, including a <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> sequel and several new <em>Witcher</em> games — none requiring you to leave your couch.</p>

## Amazon Luna lets Prime members play Ubisoft PC games they own for free

<p>Since Amazon first announced its Luna cloud gaming service in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/luna-amazon-cloud-gaming-interview-pwa-apple-173948922.html">2020</a>, Ubisoft has been one of the company’s closest partners. The publisher embraced the service early and came out of the gate with a dedicated channel. Now the two companies are deepening their partnership with an <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/1sNvJhEAasyF5xxVqyEtBg/play-ubisoft-games-you-own-on-amazon-luna">expansion of what you can do with Luna</a>.</p><p>Starting today, it’s possible to stream Ubisoft games you already own on PC through Luna. You'll need an active Prime or Luna+ subscription to do so, as well as a set of linked Amazon Luna and Ubisoft Connect accounts. Once you have those in place, you can play your existing purchases wherever Luna is available, including on Fire TV devices, Chromebooks and phones.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/luna/channel/B08LYSYW3H?&amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;tag=schoon0f-20&amp;linkId=b6e0f17cbd7b461797ddf742023b653f&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">list of compatible titles</a> features some of Ubisoft’s best-known games, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-dogs-legion-preview-hands-on-195011564.html"><em>Watch Dogs: Legion</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/riders-republic-february-25-2021-201217139.html"><em>Riders Republic</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and nearly every Assassin’s Creed game you could ever want to play. There are also a few older gems on the list, such as <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> and <em>Child of Light</em>. A Ubisoft spokesperson told Engadget the offer extends to games the publisher allowed Stadia users to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stadia-shut-down-google-ubisoft-connect-pc-gaming-184117918.html">transfer to PC</a> after Google announced the service was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-shutting-down-stadia-162704135.html">shutting down</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>At first glance, Ubisoft letting PC players use Luna without paying for its channel may not make much business sense, but there’s an element of smart marketing to the plan. The best way for a company to attract new customers to a service is to give them the opportunity to use it and see the value in it themselves. After using Luna to play games you previously purchased, you may come out of the experience more inclined to subscribe to the Ubisoft channel. That would be a win for the publisher.</p>

## EU will reportedly bar Meta from requiring personalized ads

<p>Meta <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-political-ad-targeting-fort-210525811.html">thrives on ad targeting</a>, but it may have to tone down its use of the technology in Europe. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/metas-targeted-ad-model-faces-restrictions-in-europe-11670335772?mod=djemalertNEWS">sources</a> claim the EU's European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has ruled that Meta can't require users to accept personalized ads. You could opt out of targeted ads on Facebook or Instagram if you'd rather not have the social networks track your activity. You can already decline customized ads using data from third-party apps and sites.</p><p>The board's decision wouldn't directly force Meta to change. Rather, it would ask Ireland's Data Protection Commission to apply matching orders. As Meta's European operations are officially based in Ireland, the company would have to comply.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both data boards acknowledged that there had been decisions, but didn't comment on what they entailed. We've asked Meta for comment. A spokesperson for the social media giant said it was "too early to speculate," and that the EU might still offer legal backing for targeted ads. The company argued that it had "fully" engaged with the Data Protection Commission's inquiries.</p><p>If the EU does restrict Meta's personalization, it could have a significant impact on the company's bottom line. With fewer users willing to accept targeted ads, there may be fewer people clicking those ads and encouraging advertisers to spend more on campaigns. Meta was already worried about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-ios-app-tracking-notices-192117307.html">Apple's App Tracking Transparency</a>, and warned that it might cost $10 billion in sales when it launched in 2021. The reported European measure could also prove costly, especially as it would affect Android and the web.</p><p>The EU might not be very sympathetic, as its officials have penalized Meta more than once for purported privacy violations. It faced a $402 million fine in September over allegedly illegal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-fined-405-million-euro-instagram-privacy-161348122.html">child privacy settings on Instagram</a>, and just last month received a $277 million fine for supposedly inadequate <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-fined-265-million-euros-over-data-scraping-142937633.html">safeguards against data scraping</a>. That's on top of an investigation into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-uk-probe-google-meta-ad-collusion-jedi-blue-113239217.html">possible collusion with Google</a> on display ads. Simply speaking, the Union is determined to prevent Meta's data from trading hands without consent.</p>

## Snap is testing paid upgrades to popular AR lenses

<p>Snapchat is <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/en-US/lens-fest-2022">testing out</a> a new way for its augmented reality lens creators to make money from their creations. The company is experimenting with a new feature that will allow creators to sell paid upgrades to lenses with Snapchat’s in-app currency .</p><p>Creators have flexibility in terms of the “digital goods” they can build into their existing lens. It could be a new effect within the lens, new editing tools or some other kind of “power up” that enhances the effect, according to Snap’s Sophia Dominguez, who leads the company’s AR partnerships with creators.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For its initial rollout, Snap has opted to work with creators behind some of the app’s most popular effects, like the “potato lens” (pictured in the top image). With the unlockable upgrades, fans will now be able to use tokens to change up the effect with different features like a magic wand or a police officer costume. For now, only a handful of creators have access to the feature, which will only be available in Australia and New Zealand to start.</p><p>Snapchat’s augmented reality effects have long been one of the biggest draws of the app, which has benefitted from numerous viral lenses over the years. But until now, users have been able to access all of these effects for free. And augmented reality creators hoping to monetize their work have primarily relied on partnerships with brands, which hire them to create custom lenses.</p><p>Dominguez says upgradable lenses could be an important way for more AR creators to make a living from their work. It could also prove lucrative for Snap, which has increasingly been experimenting with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-is-a-new-subscription-service-for-power-users-125633027.html"><ins>non-advertising </ins></a>sources of revenue. The company for now isn’t disclosing details about its arrangements with creators on sales of within lenses, but the company already makes money from <a href="https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/snap-tokens"><ins>Snap Tokens</ins></a>, which can also be used for game upgrades or to tip creators in the app.</p><p>Of course, all this depends on Snapchat users being willing to spend money to get exclusive new augmented reality effects, which is far from a given. “We actually have no idea how this is going to go,” Dominguez tells Engadget. “We can't guarantee anything, but we really do hope that because this is largely coming from our AR developers and this is also revenue that goes to them, their subscribers will support them.”</p>

## Apple Music now offers a karaoke mode

<p>You don't need Spotify or a dedicated app to try karaoke at home. Apple Music has <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL25ld3Nyb29tLzIwMjIvMTIvYXBwbGUtaW50cm9kdWNlcy1hcHBsZS1tdXNpYy1zaW5nLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZWI5ZTAwZGMtMGE4Yi00MjQ5LThhNDktNDVmOTJkZDI5NzExIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcnI92SpvQiDXFv4drHlnJOyfywt28PnToFC7o8-6HPg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2022%2F12%2Fapple-introduces-apple-music-sing%2F">introduced</a> a Sing feature that lets you take over the vocals. You can not only adjust the voice levels, but use multiple lyric views depending on what you want to belt out — you can perform a duet or even handle background duties. Apple also notes that the lyric views are now cued to the beat and light up slowly, so it's easier to know when you should draw out a verse.</p><p>The feature will be available worldwide for "tens of millions" of tracks later in December on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-review-2022-faster-cheaper-best-streaming-box-150013627.html">new Apple TV 4K</a> as well as recent iPhones (iPhone 11 and later) and iPads (such as last year's 9th-generation model). Android supports real-time lyrics, but won't let you adjust vocal levels. Accordingly, Apple Music plans to share more than 50 playlists devoted to songs "optimized" for the Sing feature. Don't be surprised if karaoke staples from Queen and other artists make the cut.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Spotify rolled out a karaoke feature in June, but with a very different focus. While Apple Music Sing is clearly aimed at parties, its Spotify counterpart is more of a gaming experience that records your voice and rates your performance. Apple tells Engadget its feature doesn't use microphones at all, so you won't have to worry if your version of "Islands in the Stream" needs some polish.</p><p>There's no mystery behind the addition. Sing gives you another reason to use Apple Music in group settings   — it's not just for soundtracking your latest soirée. It could also serve as a selling point for the Apple TV, where music has rarely been a major priority. While this probably won't replace the karaoke machine at your favorite bar, it might offer a good-enough experience for those times when you'd rather stay home.</p>

## Elden Ring's colosseums are opening up in a free multiplayer update

<p>Many <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/elden%20ring/"><em><ins>Elden Ring</ins></em></a> fans are hoping to hear news of an expansion for the blockbuster title at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/the%20game%20awards/"><ins>The Game Awards</ins></a> this week. Publisher Bandai Namco has jumped the gun a bit by <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1600128723533037571"><ins>announcing</ins></a> a free multiplayer-focused update, which will go live on Wednesday.</p><p>The Colosseum update will open up the titular arenas in Limgrave, Leyndell and Caelid, where players can battle it out in "duels, free-for-alls and team fights," according to a YouTube video description. The colosseums have been in the game since launch, but were inaccessible unless players <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/26/elden-ring-player-uses-mods-to-enter-closed-colosseum-discovers-site-of-grace-and-two"><ins>used mods</ins></a> or other workarounds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="97594415309f4cbe80308caa933a0115"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Although Bandai Namco hasn't revealed a ton of details about the update, having dedicated arenas for player-versus-player (PvP) battles should freshen things up for those who like to duke it out against other humans in <em>Elden Ring</em>. The trailer showed off some three vs. three combat as well. The video also includes text stating that players can "join forces to fight for the Elden Ring." That suggests there will be more robust <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elden-ring-xbox-co-op-fixed-181527647.html"><ins>co-op options</ins></a> too, though we'll need to wait until tomorrow for more info.</p><p>PvP is one of the main reasons players keep coming back to FromSoftware's games long after they've finished the single-player story, so this update will likely come as welcome news for fans. Still, this announcement doesn't stop From and Bandai Namco from revealing a more substantial expansion at The Game Awards. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-game-awards-nominations-2022-god-of-war-ragnarok-elden-ring-203750621.html"><em><ins>Elden Ring</ins></em><ins> is nominated for seven awards</ins></a> at Thursday's ceremony, including Game of the Year.</p>

## 'Valorant' is testing a shorter casual mode called Swiftplay

<p>The main thing that has put me off of playing more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/valorant/"><em>Valorant</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>over the last couple of years is the length of matches. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/riot%20games/">Riot Games</a> is looking to do something about that with a shorter casual mode that it's starting to test in the game's public build.</p><p>Matches in the core competitive and unrated (or unranked) modes typically last around 30-50 minutes. Each round can last up to two minutes or so. As such, it can take a while for one team to win 13 rounds and become the victor. Competitive matches can last even longer if the score reaches 12-12, since teams need to win by at least two rounds in overtime if they vote to keep playing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new Swiftplay mode has a similar ruleset to Unrated. However, the first team to win five rounds will emerge triumphant. Attackers and defenders will swap sides after four rounds and there's a sudden-death overtime. Riot says Swiftplay matches should run for around 15 minutes.</p><p>There are some tweaks to the economy and how players earn ultimate points to make sure they can still access all the fun stuff in the shorter format. For instance, at the start of each half of a Swiftplay match, you'll get two ultimate points for free. As such, you might be able to use the game's most powerful abilities a bit more often.</p><p>Although <em>Valorant </em>has other casual modes that don't last as long as competitive or unrated matches (such as Spike Rush and Deathmatch), Swiftplay brings the ruleset of the core modes into a more condensed format. Riot says it's a frequently requested mode that should make it easier for folks who don't have a ton of free time to play more <em>Valorant. </em>It should help other players to get more reps in too.</p><p>The Swiftstep beta is going live with <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-5-12/">today's 5.12 patch</a>, which also brings in a host of balance changes and tweaks how various abilities interact with each other. Swiftstep will be available on all maps used for the unrated mode and the beta will run until January 10th.</p>

## HBO Max returns to Prime Video Channels in the US

<p>The long-running <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-on-hbo-max-deal-impasse-233439090.html">squabble between Amazon and HBO</a> appears to be over. Amazon and Warner Bros. Discovery have <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hbo-max-launches-on-prime-video-in-the-us-301695632.html">returned</a> HBO Max to Prime Video Channels in the US. Pay $15 per month and you'll have access to <em>House of the Dragon</em> and other shows from within Prime Video — you won't have to manage separate apps or subscriptions. This will also provide access to the unified HBO Max and Discovery+ service (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-discovery-plus-merged-streaming-service-name-175817183.html">possibly called "Max"</a>) when it goes live in 2023. Discovery+ has been on Channels since 2021.</p><p>Warner Bros. Discovery strategy chief Bruce Campbell characterized the launch as a simple matter of growth. It makes HBO Max available to "as broad an audience as possible" without compromising the company's understanding of customer data, he said. Amazon VP Cem Sibay, meanwhile, saw this as fulfilling Prime Video's goal of offering the "best and widest" mix of premium content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>HBO Max launched in May 2020 without support for Amazon devices due largely to differing stances on how viewers should use the service. At the time, WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar wanted HBO Max to be available as a dedicated app on Fire TV devices rather than going through Prime Video Channels. This theoretically gave Warner more control over subscriber data that could improve recommendations and attract more users. Amazon unsurprisingly balked, as Channels support would both enable the largest possible viewership and give the online retailer more control over the experience.</p><p>HBO Max came to Fire TV <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-app-for-amazon-fire-tv-142410194.html">months later</a>, only to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-amazon-prime-video-channels-hbo-max-165006352.html">leave in 2021</a> as part of a broader exit for HBO as a whole. The decision cost WarnerMedia five million customers that quarter, and was seen as a short-term sacrifice that would ultimately pay off. HBO, HBO Max and Discovery now have a combined 94.5 million subscribers. While the return to Prime Video Channels doesn't necessarily represent a full-fledged change in strategy, it suggests Warner Bros. Discovery is no longer afraid of losing full control over its subscriber base.</p>

With the Tile Sticker, you're getting the company's Bluetooth tracking technology in a tiny disk with adhesive on one side that allows you to stick it to things like your TV's remote, your eyeglass case and other important items. You can check the Tile's last known location using its companion mobile app, and if you're within its 250-foot Bluetooth range, you can use the app to force the device to ring so you can more easily find your stuff. That works in the other direction as well — if you have your Tile on hand, you can double-press its button to ring your phone in the event you misplace that important piece of tech.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Since most features are common throughout the entire Tile lineup, you'll just have to decide which form-factor is right for you. The Sticker has the benefit of adhesive, while the standard Tile Mate has a keyring hole that makes it easy to attach to your keys. The Tile Slim is roughly the size of a credit card, making it ideal for keeping track of your wallet.</p><p>At this point, there are a number of other Bluetooth trackers on the market. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1NWDUzMkFNLUEtQWlyVGFnL2RwL0IwOTMzQlZLNlQvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWJoLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzNGEwY2I5Yi0yNTkzLTQ0M2EtOTNlOC1hYzY2NzllNDViMWMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASOdmTVtiua5Gi_GT7V6XBTAxWloxVzo7yd5P7Sh-fKs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MX532AM-A-AirTag%2Fdp%2FB0933BVK6T%2F">Apple's AirTags</a> are arguably the most popular, and <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TQU1TVU5HLVNtYXJ0VGFnLUJsdWV0b290aC1UcmFja2VyLUxvY2F0b3IvZHAvQjA4U1hMV1hIOS8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tYmgtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM0YTBjYjliLTI1OTMtNDQzYS05M2U4LWFjNjY3OWU0NWIxYyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATrORvWwSsZKYlZD8ZngPUZZ51CRpM9QUZgp2tzFlIC1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSAMSUNG-SmartTag-Bluetooth-Tracker-Locator%2Fdp%2FB08SXLWXH9%2F">Samsung makes its own trackers</a> for its smartphones, too.

## TSMC is building a second chip plant to meet US semiconductor demand

<p>The White House and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing co. (TSMC) have announced plans to build a second chip plant in Arizona, <a href="https://eu.azcentral.com/story/money/business/2022/12/06/tsmc-announces-2nd-factory-in-phoenix-as-president-biden-visits-arizona/69690235007/"><em>AZCentral</em></a> has reported. That will boost the company's investment in the state from $12 billion to $40 billion, while heavily reducing US reliance on semiconductor imports.&nbsp;</p><p>Both TSMC factories combined will produce 600,000 wafers per year. "At scale, these two [plants] could meet the entire U.S. demand for U.S. chips when they’re completed," the National Economic Council's Ronnie Chatterji told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/06/tsmc-to-up-arizona-investment-to-40-billion-with-second-semiconductor-chip-plant.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>. "That’s the definition of supply chain resilience. We won’t have to rely on anyone else to make the chips we need."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The newly announced factory will produce cutting-edge 3-nanometer chips by 2026. The expansion marks one of the largest direct foreign investments in the US and the largest in Arizona. TSMC recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/01/tsmc-arizona-4nm-chips-2024/">upgraded its plans</a> at its first facility as well, announcing it will now manufacture 4-nanometer instead of 5-nanometer wafers. The first chips are set to be manufactured there starting in 2024, with <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/finance/news/taiwan-semiconductor-wins-apple-nvidia-161711734.html">Apple and NVIDIA</a> reportedly among the first customers.&nbsp;</p><p>The CHIPS and Science Act allotted $52.7 billion in loans and other incentives, plus billions more in tax credits, to encourage US semiconductor manufacturing investment. The legislation aims to boost private financing in chip manufacturing in the US.</p><p>President Joe Biden is set to visit the site of TSMC's first plant later today, but the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/05/u-s-eu-joint-statement-of-the-trade-and-technology-council/">announced</a> other related news yesterday. The US Department of Commerce and the European Commission are striking a deal to implement an "early warning mechanism" related to semiconductor chain disruptions following a pilot program last summer. The aim is to improve forecasting of semiconductor supply and demand to achieve a balance between the two.</p><p>At the same time, the EU and US are implementing a "transparency" mechanism around public support provided to the chip sector. In other words, one side won't blindside the other with unexpected semiconductor subsidies that could put either at a competitive disadvantage. A similar issue <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/04/america-first-ira-biden-eu/">came up</a> during a recent visit by French President Macron, as EU leaders complained that the US Inflation Reduction Act was unfair to non-American companies.&nbsp;</p>

## Google Search results now continuously scroll on desktop

<p>Google is giving its search results on desktop the "continuous scrolling" treatment over a year after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-search-continuous-scrolling-171307808.html">launching</a> the feature on mobile. Continuous scrolling will eliminate the need to click "Next" or the page numbers at the bottom of your search results. Instead, Google will automatically load the next batch of results on the page once you've scrolled to the bottom of the current list. If you use Google on mobile, the feature will feel very familiar.&nbsp;</p><p>The tech giant has confirmed the rollout to <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-brings-continuous-scroll-to-desktop-search-results-390004"><em>Search Engine Land</em></a> and told the publication that its website will automatically show up to six pages of results before you need to click a "More results" button to load the next batches. Its arrival on desktop will make the Google search experience more consistent across devices and platforms. "So starting today, we're bringing continuous scrolling to desktop so you can continue to see more helpful search results with fewer clicks. It's now even easier to get inspired with more information at your fingertips," a company spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Similar to the mobile version of the feature, it will initially be available for English queries in the US and will most likely make its way to more people and more regions in the future.&nbsp;</p>

## The Morning After: Nothing is ‘in talks’ to bring its smartphones to the US

<p>While many phone fans in the US are intrigued with the Nothing Phone 1, with its transparent back and flashing glyph design, they couldn’t buy one. At least, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-phone-1-import-to-usa-130001121.html">not easily</a>. It might be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-in-talks-to-launch-a-new-smartphone-in-the-us-101037859.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">easier for its follow-up devices</a>, though.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-in-talks-to-launch-a-new-smartphone-in-the-us-101037859.html%20https://www.engadget.com/..."><figure><img alt="TMA" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/82dd7300-755e-11ed-9f79-44d1e196b1a5" style="height: 450; width: 675;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure></a><p>Nothing co-founder Carl Pei told <em>CNBC</em> the Nothing Phone 1 isn't available in the US because the company wasn't ready to deal with the complexities of the market, which usually entails dealing with powerful US carriers. "Now we are in discussions with some carriers in the US to potentially launch a future product there," he said. Nothing already sells its Ear Stick wireless buds in the US, which apparently made up a third of that product's sales. And as the co-founder of OnePlus, Pei is already well acquainted with the US smartphone market. It took years for OnePlus to launch a device with carrier support.</p><p>Nothing has topped 600,000 Phone 1 devices sold so far. But Pei has big ambitions, matched by similarly big challenges. He previously said the company has a "zero-percent margin" on its phones, due to the strong US dollar and less-than-favorable terms from suppliers. "The goal is to be profitable in 2024," he said.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

## Apple's Self Service Repair program comes to Europe

<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-self-service-repair-release-date-122332505.html">launching it in the US</a> earlier this year, Apple's Self Service Repair program has arrived in eight European countries. Customers there will be able to perform many of the most common fixes on the iPhone 12 an iPhone 13 lineups, along with MacBooks with Apple silicon (not Intel models). "The Self Service Repair Store provides access to more than 200 individual parts and tools, as well as repair manuals," Apple said in a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VrL25ld3Nyb29tLzIwMjIvMTIvYXBwbGUtbGF1bmNoZXMtc2VsZi1zZXJ2aWNlLXJlcGFpci1pbi1ldXJvcGUvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkNTg1ZGFiZi0xOWZhLTQxMjEtYjYwNS03Y2E4MGZkNzhjOGYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVcu9pj-Nra-PkdNV2VCyo4ILrW13q-387jwH7kPE5Rm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fuk%2Fnewsroom%2F2022%2F12%2Fapple-launches-self-service-repair-in-europe%2F">press release</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Spare parts and tools can be purchased at <a href="https://selfservicerepair.eu/en-GB/home">Apple's Self Service repair store</a> in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. Apple said that they're the same ones, at the same prices, as those available to authorized repair providers. If you'd rather not purchase a tool for a one-time repair, you can rent a kit for a week at £54.90. Customers can send back replaced parts for refurbishment and recycling and potentially receive a credit.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A few examples of part prices include a battery module for £70.78 (€77.04), a display module for £282.28 (€327.11) and a camera module for £168.55 (€192.76). A <a href="https://selfservicerepair.eu/en-GB/tool-kit-rental">lot of tools</a> are required for an iPhone 13 repair, including a battery press, display press, adhesive cutter, various torque drivers and a magnetizer (among others), so the rental seems like a good solution. Also, it goes without saying that you should feel confident doing relatively complex repair jobs.</p><figure><img alt="Apple's Self Service Repair program comes to Europe" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/2d448000-7554-11ed-add8-f60cce8cd46f" style="height: 1306; width: 1960;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>It's a good option for folks who may be far from an authorized Apple repair center. At the same time, you may want to compare the price of the parts, tool rental and your own time with the cost of a professional repair from Apple or a third party.&nbsp;</p><p>"We believe the best technology for our customers and for the planet is technology that lasts, which is why we design our products to be durable and rarely require maintenance or repair," said Apple COO Jeff Williams. "But when a repair is needed, we want customers to have many options for safe, reliable, and secure repair."</p><p>That's well and good, but Apple was essentially forced into this position by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-user-iphone-repair-policy-change-173047862.html">right-to-repair rules</a> both in the United States and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-11-eu-right-to-repair-phones-tablets-computers.html">Europe</a>. The EU also wants you to be able to go back more than two generations for repairs. It recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-rules-phone-tablet-reparability-battery-life-software-updates-163636788.html">proposed new rules</a> that would require 15 components (batteries, displays, chargers, etc.) to be available for at least five years after a phone is released in the EU — or back to the iPhone X, in Apple's case.&nbsp;</p><p>The EU also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-usb-c-port-charging-requirement-approved-141546579.html">passed a law</a> requiring USB-C charging for mobile devices by the end of 2024, meaning that Apple will have to eliminate its Lightning connector on iPhones by that time. The law represents an effort to eliminate e-waste in the form of cables, since even owning two Apple devices (an iPad Pro and an iPhone) requires two separate cables.&nbsp;</p>

## Meta's Oversight Board finds cross-check puts 'business concerns' ahead of human rights

<p>More than a year after Meta asked the Oversight Board to weigh in on its cross-check rules, the group has finally published its full policy advisory on the topic. The board found that the program, which creates a separate content moderation process for certain high-profile users, prioritizes the company’s business over the rights of its users.</p><p>“In our review, we found several shortcomings in Meta’s cross-check program,” the board writes in its assessment. “While Meta told the Board that cross-check aims to advance Meta’s human rights commitments, we found that the program appears more directly structured to satisfy business concerns.” Notably, the critique echoes that of whistleblower Frances Haugen, who revealed explosive details about cross-check last year, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety-062311634.html"><ins>has said</ins></a> that Meta “chooses profits over safety.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Cross-check, or xcheck, is an internal program at Facebook and Instagram that shields celebrities, politicians, and other high-profile users from the company’s automated content moderation systems. Meta has <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/07/working-to-keep-facebook-safe/"><ins>characterized</ins></a> it as a “second layer of review” to avoid mistakenly removing posts. But <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-vip-cross-check-xcheck-181720267.html"><ins>disclosures</ins></a> made by Haugen showed the program includes millions of accounts, and has enabled billions of views on posts that would have otherwise been taken down. The Oversight Board itself has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebooks-oversight-board-said-the-company-failed-to-provide-relevant-information-132603146.html"><ins>accused Meta</ins></a> of being not “fully forthcoming” about the program, which was a central issue in the board’s handling of the suspension of former President Donald Trump.</p><p>The Oversight Board’s policy advisory opinion, or PAO, on the program is the most detailed to look to date at Meta’s evolving cross-check rules. The board writes at length about two separate cross-check processes: Early Response Secondary Review (ERSR), which is reserved for certain high-profile users determined by Meta, and General Secondary Review (GSR), a newer system that uses an algorithm to automatically flag some types of posts from across its platform for additional review. GSR, which can apply to content from any Facebook or Instagram user, began in 2021 “in response to criticism” related to Haugen’s disclosures in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whats-in-the-facebook-papers-and-what-it-means-for-the-company-194502237.html"><ins>Facebook Papers</ins></a>.</p><p>But according to the Oversight Board, both cross-check systems have serious issues. Both operate with a “consistent backlog of cases,” which lengthens the amount of time potentially rule-breaking content is left up. “Meta told the Board, that, on average, it can take more than five days to reach a decision on content from users on its cross-check lists,” the group notes. “This means that, because of cross-check, content identified as breaking Meta’s rules is left up on Facebook and Instagram when it is most viral and could cause harm.”</p><p>The board sheds new light on one such case, pointing to a 2019 incident in which Brazilian soccer star Neymar posted a video showing nude photos of a woman who had accused of him of sexual assault. Because of cross-check, the post was left up for more than a day and received more than 100 million views before it was ultimately removed. In its opinion, the board raises questions about why the athlete was not suspended, and pointedly notes that the incident only came to light as a result of Haugen’s disclosures.</p><blockquote><p>“The company ultimately disclosed that the only consequence was content removal, and that the normal penalty would have been account disabling ... Meta later announced it signed an economic deal with Neymar for him to ‘stream games exclusively on Facebook Gaming and share video content to his more than 166 million Instagram fans.’"</p></blockquote><p>The Oversight Board is similarly critical of other “business” factors that play a role in Meta’s cross-check rules. For example, it says Meta skews toward under-enforcement of cross-checked content due to the "perception of censorship" and the effect it could have on the company. “The Board interprets this to mean that, for business reasons, addressing the ‘perception of censorship’ may take priority over other human rights responsibilities relevant for content moderation,” the group writes.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the board had numerous recommendations for Meta on how to improve cross-check. The board says Meta should use “specialized teams independent from political or economic influence, including from Meta’s public policy teams,” to determine which accounts get cross-check protections. It also suggests that there should be a “transparent strike system” to revoke cross-check status from accounts that abuse the company's rules.</p><p>The board also recommends that Meta inform all accounts that are part of cross-check, and “publicly mark the pages and accounts of entities receiving list-based protection in the following categories: all state actors and political candidates, all business partners, all media actors, and all other public figures included because of the commercial benefit to the company.” It also wants Meta to track and report key statistics about cross-check accuracy, and take steps to eliminate the backlogs in cases.</p><p>In total the Oversight Board came up with 32 detailed recommendations, which Meta will now have 90 days to respond to. As with other policy suggestions from the board, the company isn't obligated to implement any of its suggestions, though it is expected to respond to each one.</p>

## NLRB says Apple violated federal law with anti-union meetings in Atlanta

<p>Apple violated federal law by holding mandatory "captive audience" meetings and making coercive statements with anti-union messaging, the National Labor Relations Board's (NLRB) Atlanta regional director has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-05/apple-s-anti-union-tactics-in-atlanta-were-illegal-us-officials-say?sref=10lNAhZ9">concluded</a>. The workers at Apple's Cumberland Mall store <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-store-union-election-filing-atlanta-cwa-nlrb-194925440.html">filed for a union election</a> with the NLRB earlier this year in a bid to join the Communications Workers of America (CWA). In May, however, they withdrew their petition, and the CWA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-union-busting-accused-atlanta-165534373.html">submitted an Unfair Labor Practice</a> complaint on their behalf.&nbsp;</p><p>The CWA said in its complaint at the time that Apple had "conducted mandatory 'captive audience' meetings with bargaining unit employees regarding the upcoming election." In a newer statement sent to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-05/apple-s-anti-union-tactics-in-atlanta-were-illegal-us-officials-say?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the organization said that holding meetings like that is "not only union-busting, but an example of psychological warfare." As the news organization notes, the NLRB had previously allowed companies to require employees to attend mandatory meetings prior to union elections. But Jennifer Abruzzo, the labor board's current general counsel, sees them as coercive and in violation of the law.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The NLRB said that it will issue a complaint if the tech giant doesn't settle. While the labor board's regional director has sided with the workers and with CWA, it's still up in the air whether Apple will be required to change its policies or suffer any sort of punishment. Complaints issued by regional directors will have to go through the board's judges, and companies could approach the NLRB's board members in Washington to appeal rulings they hand down. The case could go to federal court after that.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-nlrb-anti-union-complaint-160802668.html">facing another complaint</a> by the NLRB, which found enough merit in a report also filed by the CWA on behalf of the company's World Trade Center workers in NYC. For that particular case, Apple was accused of surveilling staff, limiting their access to pro-union fliers and forcing them to listen to anti-union speeches. If Apple doesn't settle, a judge will hear the case on December 13th.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Waze is France's most popular navigation app, to the point that it was recently <a href="https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/insolite/la-celebre-appli-gps-waze-lance-une-option-avec-l-accent-toulousain-1653914631">updated</a> with three regional accents (Toulouse, Provençal and <a href="https://www.myfrenchlife.org/2017/07/04/bienvenue-chez-les-chtis/">ch'ti</a>). So it makes sense that Waze elected to partner with French automaker Renault to <a href="https://blog.google/waze/for-the-first-time-waze-navigation-is-built-in-to-your-car/">launch</a> a new, dedicated version of the app for cars. It's available on infotainment systems via <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-06-11-google-confirms-acquisition-of-waze.html">Google integration</a>, starting with the <a href="https://www.renault.co.uk/cars/austral.html">Austral Hybrid</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/renault-megane-e-tech-electric-battery-fire-access-safety-163050987.html">Megane E-Tech EV</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>To be clear, it's already possible to use Waze on Android Auto by installing it as an app from your smartphone. What's different is that Renault drivers can now install the app directly to the infotainment system and use it without the need for a mobile device.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>"When you drive, you can experience safer and more convenient journeys while eliminating the hassle of using a smartphone," Waze wrote on its blog. "With this new experience, Renault drivers will have all Waze real-time routing, navigation and alerts, plus settings, preferences and saved places, built into their car display."</p><p>Renault's <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXJ3b3cuY28udWsvcmVuYXVsdC9tZWdhbmUtZXRlY2gtZWxlY3RyaWMvaW50ZXJpb3IjZ3JlZiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzMxMTQ3MTAtYTcyYS00YzkwLTkzZDAtODdkM2YzZmY3M2Q4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAQsmfh-56sqhIBEcEi_zOXemQ3TOmFYZqD-TVGS-Zg3z&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.carwow.co.uk%2Frenault%2Fmegane-etech-electric%2Finterior%23gref">latest multimedia system</a> supports CarPlay and Android Auto wirelessly and has a number of apps like Google Maps and Spotify pre-installed — with no need to connect your phone for those apps. You can install Waze either from the Play store in the above vehicles' infotainment systems, or from Renault's dedicated app.&nbsp;</p><p>Waze appears set to expand to other vehicles and brands, saying it's "looking forward to bringing this excellent driving experience to more users across the globe in 2023."

<p>The US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Inspector General is reportedly investigating <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-unveils-v-2-of-the-neuralink-brainmachine-interface-surgery-bot-231559145.html">Neuralink</a> over potential animal welfare violations related to research testing. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/musks-neuralink-faces-federal-probe-employee-backlash-over-animal-tests-2022-12-05/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social"><em>Reuters</em></a>, internal documents show that staff members have been raising concerns that the company has been rushing animal testing and causing needless suffering and death.&nbsp;</p><p>The news organization said the company has killed 1,500 animals, including more than 280 sheep, pigs and monkeys, since 2018. Those numbers don't automatically mean Neuralink is violating the law, and the company has passed all USDA inspections of its facilities. Former and current employees told <em>Reuters</em>, however, that pressure from Neuralink founder <a href="https://www.engadget.com/neuralink-elon-musk-investment-in-rival-brain-chip-company-synchron-134049357.html">Elon Musk</a> to accelerate development has led to faulty experiments and, hence, death rates higher than they need to be.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Musk has reportedly been telling employees since the company was launched in 2016 to imagine that they had a bomb strapped to their heads in an effort to make them move faster. He also reportedly told staff that he would trigger a "market failure" unless they made progress, which some employees interpreted as a warning that he would shut down the company. Earlier this year, Musk also sent staff members an email with an article about Swiss researchers who created an implant that helped a paralyzed person walk again, <em>Reuters</em> said. "In general, we are simply not moving fast enough. It is driving me nuts!" he reportedly wrote in a follow-up email.</p><p>Upon reviewing internal testing documentation, <em>Reuters</em> said it found four experiments involving 86 pigs and two monkeys with results that were rendered questionable by human errors. Neuralink had to repeat those experiments, leading to more deaths. A message written by an angry employee talked about how rushed animal surgeries had led to under-prepared and overstressed employees who ended up making mistakes. A couple of examples <em>Reuters</em> found in the documents detailed how Neuralink staff implanted the company's brain-machine interface device on the wrong vertebra of two different pigs — something that could've been easily prevented by counting the animals' vertebrae — forcing the team to kill them to end their suffering.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, the animal rights group Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/elon-musk-neuralink-monkeys-brain-chip-monkey-death/11581014/">accused</a> the company botching surgeries that killed monkeys. Neuralink admitted that it had killed six monkeys in its joint study with the University of California, Davis due to issues caused by their experiments. However, they defended their research and said that it didn't break any laws.&nbsp;</p><p>Neuralink recently held an event announcing that it could <a href="https://www.engadget.com/neuralink-ceo-elon-musk-expects-human-trials-within-six-months-025416421.html">start human trials</a> within the next six months. During the program, company founder Elon Musk directly responded to the Phyisicians Committee accusations: "Before we would even think of putting a device in an animal, we do everything possible we with rigorous benchtop testing, We're not cavalier about putting these devices into animals. We're extremely careful and we always want the device, whenever we do the implant — whether into a sheep, pig or monkey — to be confirmatory, not exploratory," he said.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Reuters</em>, however, said it found Neuralink records with numerous references to "exploratory surgeries." Autumn Sorrells, Neuralink's Animal Care Program Director, also reportedly ordered employees in October to remove "exploration" from their study titles and to stop using the term going forward.&nbsp;</p>
