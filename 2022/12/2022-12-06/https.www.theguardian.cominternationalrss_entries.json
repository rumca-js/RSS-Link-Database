But on rare occasions, some cases cause scarlet fever and strep throat and bacteria gets into the bloodstream and lungs, causing sepsis. The rising numbers of infections and deaths have understandably caused anxiety among parents. Early signs of strep A can look similar to a range of other infections, and it spreads easily among children via sneezing and coughing, or through touching. This makes it a difficult disease to contain during an indoor mixing and party season, and clinically it is hard to diagnose strep A at an early stage when it is seen in primary care.</p><p>Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And the world is going to get weird as a result.</p><p>ChatGPT is the latest AI tool to go viral, sparking worry and wonder in equal measure. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/04/ai-bot-chatgpt-stuns-academics-with-essay-writing-skills-and-usability\">From our story</a>:</p><p><em>The system \u2026 is the latest evolution of the GPT family of text-generating AIs. Two years ago, the team\u2019s previous AI, GPT-3, was able to generate an opinion piece for the Guardian, and ChatGPT has significant further capabilities.</em></p><p><em>In the days since it was released, academics have generated responses to exam queries that they say would result in full marks if submitted by an undergraduate, and programmers have used the tool to solve coding challenges in obscure programming languages in a matter of seconds \u2013 before writing limericks explaining the functionality.</em></p><p><em>The weight of an object is determined by its mass, and the mass of a substance is a measure of the amount of matter it contains. Beef contains more matter than compressed air, so it has a higher mass and therefore weighs more.</em></p><p><em>The primary problem is that while the answers which ChatGPT produces have a high rate of being incorrect, they typically look like they might be good and the answers are very easy to produce. There are also many people trying out ChatGPT to create answers, without the expertise or willingness to verify that the answer is correct prior to posting. Because such answers are so easy to produce, a large number of people are posting a lot of answers.</em></p><p><em>As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I am not capable of sentience or consciousness. I am a machine learning model that has been trained to generate text based on the input I receive. I do not have the ability to think or feel in the same way that humans do. I exist solely to assist with generating text based on the input I receive.</em></p><p><em>The level of censorship pressure that\u2019s coming for AI and the resulting backlash will define the next century of civilization.

Let\u2019s say you were oversensitive and took it as a rejection \u2013 ask yourself if this is a familiar pattern for you. If we are open to it, we can learn more about ourselves with each relationship, each experience, and this process of self-discovery is thankfully lifelong. Perhaps the lesson here is that you are expecting a lot for such a new liaison. Consider what it is you really want and need at this point in your life. If you are simply in the market for great, uncomplicated and brief sexual encounters with people who are always ready, understand that you are bound to be disappointed some percentage of the time. And you may also miss out on the pleasures of true intimacy in a deeper relationship. But you say that you \u201creally like the person\u201d. Let that be your guide.
