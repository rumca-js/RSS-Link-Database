Today it was general counsel James Baker. You may remember him from such files as \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-woods-twitter-files\" target=\"_blank\">The Twitter Files</a>,\" where his name came up as a driving force behind the bird app censoring the Hunter Biden laptop story and anyone who tried to share it.</p><p>Elon and James had a kibitz today. Musk was not amused. Baker is not employed.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">In light of concerns about Baker\u2019s possible role in suppression of information important to the public dialogue, he was exited from Twitter today<br />\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1600237095364096000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 6, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Yes.

Prior to being the general council for Twitter, he was the general counsel for the FBI. There, he had his fingers in RussiaGate with the discredited Steele Dossier. He was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1600245692248731648\" target=\"_blank\">fired from the FBI in 2018</a> for leaking to the press. He was then hired by Twitter, where he censored the press instead.</p><p>That includes getting his hand on the first batch of \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-twitter-files\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Files</a>\" before they found their way to independent journalists Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss. There was supposed to be a cornucopia of more files dropped over the weekend that got held up. Jim Baker is why.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">We can now tell you part of the reason why. On Tuesday, Twitter Deputy General Counsel (and former FBI General Counsel) Jim Baker was fired. Among the reasons? Vetting the first batch of \u201cTwitter Files\u201d \u2013 without knowledge of new management.<br />\u2014 Matt Taibbi (@mtaibbi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1600243756074049537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 6, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Unclear at this time is if James Baker has accepted the job as an \"analyst\" at MSNBC yet. I'd say CNN might be an option, but they are in the process of yeeting people out the door as well.</p><p>The rest of us wait anxiously for the next batch of Twitter Files. I can't imagine there would be much more on Hunter.

Now it's \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/office-actress-asian-cancel-culture\" target=\"_blank\">you couldn't make <em>The Office</em> today</a>,\" a show that's been gone for less than ten years.

You couldn't make the show today because of how \"inappropriate\" it is...even though it's STILL POPULAR. \"Tastes\" and what \"offends people\" has allegedly changed, even though in 2000 the show was the most streamed show during the pandemic. You most certainly CAN still make the show today. Mindy says so herself. She just doesn't realize she said so.</p><p>The only ones offended and whose \"tastes\" have changed are the permaoffended woke twats working in Hollywood, writing for digital tabloids in Park Slope, and who <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-cancelled-twitter\" target=\"_blank\">have recently been fired from Twitter</a>.  Normal people, a vast majority of us, still think that brand of comedy is funny.</p><p>You could still make <em>The Office</em> today, or a show like <em>The Office. </em>It's not that you can't.

He's super sorry about it too. Liver said so in a video <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/12/06/liver-king-steroids-apology-ancestral-diet/\" target=\"_blank\">where he was in full character</a>, with his shirt off, showing his roided-up body he's sorry about. Joe Rogan was not impressed, and there is another actor he thinks should come clean about not being clean. Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson.</p><p>Methinks this is going to cause some media buzz.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n<span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>\n<small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Joe Rogan: The Rock Is On 'Roids!? & The Rest Of These Super Hero Actors Are Juiced To The Gills!!</small>\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/1ADxgf8oOwU\" target=\"_blank\">youtu.be</a>\n</small>\n</p><blockquote>The Rock should come clean right now. He should make a video in response to the Liver King video like, \"I need to talk to you because The Rock\u2019s been lying.\" There\u2019s not a f*cking chance in hell he\u2019s clean, not a chance in hell as big as The Rock is at fifty.</blockquote><p>To be clear, Rogan was half-doing schtick. He also wasn't saying with authority The Rock does or doesn't use. Rogan presented the schtick without evidence. Critics say the eyeball test is evidence enough. But it's not like Rogan presented a peer-reviewed study independently fact-checked by independent fact-checkers. </p><p>Rogan's point is less about the steroids and more about lying about it. When it comes to people like The Rock and The Liver King who are advocating for an allegedly healthy lifestyle, \"There\u2019s a responsibility that you have to the people that are listening to you.\"</p><p>It will be interesting to see if The Rock responds. The last time The Rock said anything about Rogan, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dwayne-jonhnson-rejects-joe-rogan\" target=\"_blank\">it was when The Rock saw a video</a> put out by a <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-portnoy-medias-touch\" target=\"_blank\">shadowy, dark-money progressive SuperPAC</a> implying that Rogan was racist.</p><p>Rogan is hardly the first person to accuse a professional wrestler of taking steroids. He's just the first #1 podcaster in the world to make an accusation about one of the top A-list actors. If The Rock smells what his team of publicists are cooking, my money is on everyone pretending this video never happened.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

The left would still be leading the charge though. They spent a year calling DeSantis a killer and elventy different kinds of a -phobic. Nothing stuck. He faced it all and he stood tall. The only thing left is to do 2024 his way.</p><p>So to the gods of content, I beseech you. Please, in your divine wisdom, grant onto either man this meaningless award and allow it to deliver an abundance of meltdowns, angry tweets, and shakyfists. In the name of the holy page view, we pray. Amen.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

Yet, somehow, he still has a job serving more than 16,000 students in 20 schools. Parents from those schools and of those students aren't happy about it. Nor should anyone with any semblance of a conscience.</p><p>As reported by <a href=\"https://www.libsoftiktok.com/p/documents-reveal-ohio-superintendent?sd=pf\" target=\"_blank\">citizen journalist Libs of TikTok</a>, Superintendent Matt Miller's alleged sexual fantasies and desires involving students -- including raping and drugging minors -- have been revealed in court documents. Parents demanded his resignation at a recent <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/search/?q=school+board\" target=\"_blank\">school board meeting</a>.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">SCOOP: Documents reveal superintendent of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LakotaDistrict?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@LakotaDistrict</a>\u2019s alleged sexual fantasies and desires involving students- including raping and drugging minors<br /><br />He\u2019s still employed there and parents are demanding his resignation and an investigation.<br /><br />More on this story shortly <a href=\"https://t.co/8rRhuBgzxV\">pic.twitter.com/8rRhuBgzxV</a><br />\u2014 Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1599919880379437059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 6, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>It began when a parent filed a police report against the superintendent and provided police with copies of text messages she received, including ones between Miller and his ex-wife where he seemingly admitted to fantasizing about raping minors. During an interview with police, the ex-wife \"alleged that her ex-husband used to traffick her to other men, sent her child pornography, and asked her to molest children in the school district, even her own son.\"</p><blockquote>At one point he had asked me - I have a friend who has three little boys\u2026 and he said I should volunteer to watch the boys so the parents could go out. Give them sleeping pills, molest them for him and videotape it.</blockquote><p>We're not even at the sick part yet. An honorable scumbag could have denied everything and called his ex-wife a liar. Miller didn't deny the allegations at all. He told investigators it was all pillow talk and that he and his ex-wife would role-play <strong>\"which on at least one occasion included a discussion of drugging, molesting, and recording three kids.\"</strong></p><p>The Butler County Sheriff's Office claimed there wasn't \"probable cause\" to bring criminal charges against Miller, even though they didn't investigate any of his electronic devices. The school board didn't find \"any wrongdoing\" in their \"investigation\" either.</p><p>To recap, a school superintendent not only has sexual fantasies about raping and drugging children, he admits having those fantasies to the police. But because he hasn't acted on those fantasies yet - yet - he still has a job that gives him access to SIXTEEN THOUSAND CHILDREN. This is the world we are living in now.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

Actor Chris Pratt would do something that reminded everyone he exists, and some form of \"cancel Chris Pratt\" would trend on Twitter. Then Elon Musk fired the Twitter Curation team. They were the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-engineer-free-speech\" target=\"_self\">commie-as-f*ck employees</a> tasked with curating what you saw trend Now, two major movie trailers later and no one has thrown a Chris Pratt is over party. Weird, right?</p><p>I was just thinking about this, because when the trailer for the <em>Guardian of the Galaxy Christmas Special</em> dropped, I was expecting the usual suspects to cancel the \"worst\" Chris. Yet even with new trailers for <em>Super Mario Brothers</em> and <em>Guardians 3</em>,  it's conspicuously quiet.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">It\u2019s time to face the music.<br /><br />Watch the brand-new trailer for Marvel Studios\u2019 Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 that just debuted at Brazil Comic Con <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CCXP2022?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CCXP2022</a>.

Or, when the actor <a href=\"https://www.theblaze.com/news/chris-pratt-pilloried-daughter-classy-faith-based-statements\" target=\"_blank\">would post something about his family</a>.  You see, the knock on Pratt (by idiots) is that he likes Jesus, America, and hunting. And because he uses his platform to make millions of people happy and NOT attack Trump supporters, leftists hate him. Presumably, the same leftists who would curate what they wanted to trend on Twitter. Then, other leftists who hate him and who work in digital media would write about how Pratt was being canceled on Twitter. It was a never-ending cycle.</p><p>It's not just a lack of Cancelling Chris. Japanese Twitter users noticed after a reporter complained <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-trending-topics-japan\" target=\"_blank\">she had no one left at Twitter to call anymore to make sure her \"news\" articles trended</a>, the bird app was becoming more pleasant:</p><blockquote><em>Users appear to consider the new trending list as more authentic than the politics-infused list allegedly curated by Twitter, which is a fair assumption. Japanese users have compared this list to previous days where almost all trending topics were political in nature. The user who posted the list called the new trends \u201cpeaceful\u201d and joked about how the curation team must have spend their time \u201csorting out topics like this every day\u201d.</em></blockquote><p>It turns out that when Twitter employees don't have their finger on the scale, Twitter users don't care about the political topics those Twitter employees want them to care about. Like, for example, one of the few A-List actors who doesn't validate the now former Twitter employees' \"commie as f*ck\" political worldviews. </p><p>Dig through Twitter, I'm sure you will find a hand full of dinkuses angry about Pratt's existence. But they stayed a handful of dinkuses and weren;t turned into a national trend. With no one to cherry-pick a few tweets to create the illusion the internet hates Chris Pratt, the internet doesn't hate Chris Pratt.</p><p>Or, it's all a coincidence we're reading too much in too. There have been a number of those coincidences since Elon took over.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
