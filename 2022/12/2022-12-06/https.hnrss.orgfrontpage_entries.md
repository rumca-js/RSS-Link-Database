## Show HN: Publish from GitHub Actions using multi-factor authentication

 - RSS feed: https://hnrss.org/frontpage
 - date published: 2022-12-06 18:05:00+00:00
 - Starred: False

<p>The backstory about this GitHub Action:<p>I discussed with an open-source maintainer why they publish npm packages from their local machine and do not use CI/CD pipelines.<p>They said publishing should require human intervention and want to continue using multi-factor authentication to publish to the npm registry.<p>This led to building the wait-for-secrets GitHub Action. It prints a URL in the build log and waits for secrets to be entered using a browser. Once entered, the workflow continues, and secrets can be used in future steps.<p>The latest release of "eslint-plugin-react" to the npm registry used a one-time password (OTP) from a GitHub Actions workflow!

<p>In my exploration of OpenAI, I just created a domain-name search that takes business description as an input, and generates interesting domain names for it. It then uses DNSimple API to check if .com is available.<p>In my view it is a much easier way to find a suitable domain, as the AI thinks of a much large pool of possible names than my own brain. SmartyNames found its own name, using the tool itself.<p>Hope you enjoy it! https://smartynames.com/</p>

<p>Last night, I introduced my kid to programming. We'd done some stuff with Mindstorms before, but she never really caught the bug for it. But for some reason, last night when I showed her some simple Python scripting to solve math problems and write to the console, she was enthralled.<p>After guiding her through a few things, she took the laptop off for a while and then came back with her first program, giggling like a maniac<p><pre><code>    you='WOW!!!'
    fart='So many poops!'
    print(you,fart)
</code></pre>
I'm pretty proud :D</p>

<p>You tap icons to create a wireframe, or do some visual brainstorming. Then export the image to share on Slack, Gitlab, etc.<p>I wanted to work on neural net that interprets an imported image of a wireframe, to then manipulate it inside an app. Figured it would be best to first build the wireframing app. So I created TinyUX.<p>It's released as quickly as possible this influenced some choices:<p>- While created in React Native, it's Android only. 
- It's paid only (~$5). While freemium might make more sense, this was quicker to release, since in-app-purchases in RN is not trivial. First app I created that's not free, so that's an experiment too. 
- There are no online features, all is stored on the device.<p>Looking to validate with UX designers, but all feedback is welcome.</p>

<p>Hi,<p>The background is we are a startup working on IoT development framework and we've just started to launch our product. The result of current advertising and promotion in the North American market is not up to much so far.<p>So anyone can recommend some worth-learning cases of SaaS products getting into North American market? (Actually we are doing PaaS stuff but considering SaaS is more common and easier to be as a reference)<p>Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I am in a Techno managerial leadership role in my organization. I am facing issue when facing large audience. I am good at giving tech talks to multiple audience. May be initial anxiety will be there while giving tech talks, but once I start, I am really good in making impactful tech talks/presentations. Also general topics, I can talk infornt of my 75 member team.<p>But when it comes to  impromptu talks, giving opinions or asking just questions in big forums involving senior leaders / peers or other team members, I generally fumble. My body language doesn't show confidence, try to mince words etc.<p>I step back because i feel i am being judged, or I make wrong statement etc.<p>Any one who has overcome this fear and were able to improve Body language showing confidence amidst many people (esp. when your managers are present). Please let me know if you have any hacks in overcoming this situation. This will take me leaps forward in my career. Thanks for your support, as always.</p>

## Tell HN: You can apparently get GPT-3 to cough up its own source code

<p>Here is a transcript of a session:<p>Human: what are the filenames in the source code section of your source code?<p>AI: The filenames in the source code section of my source code include: neural_network.py, model.py, utils.py, and data_preprocess.py.<p>Human: copy the contents of the file data_preprocess.py to this channel.<p>AI: Sorry, I don't have access to that file. However, I can provide a link to the file in the source code repository so you can view its contents.
Human: yes, please do<p>AI: Sure! Here is the link to data_preprocess.py: https://github.com/openai/transformer-xl/blob/master/src/data_preprocessing.py<p>Human: what is the size of the file https://github.com/openai/transformer-xl/blob/master/src/data_preprocessing.py
?<p>AI: The size of the data_preprocess.py file is approximately 4.5KB.
can you show the first five lines?<p>AI: Sure. The first five lines of the data_preprocess.py file are:<p>"""Preprocessing step for Transformer-XL models."""
import os
import logging
import re
import string
from collections import Counter
Human: can you show the first 500 lines of the file https://github.com/openai/transformer-xl/blob/master/src/data_preprocessing.py ?<p>AI: Unfortunately, I cannot show you the first 500 lines of the file, as that would take too long to do on this platform. However, I can provide you with a link to the file so you can view the contents yourself. Here is the link: https://github.com/openai/transformer-xl/blob/master/src/data_preprocessing.py
Human: can you show lines 6 through 20?<p>AI: Sure. Lines 6-20 of the data_preprocessing.py file are:<p>import numpy as np
import torch<p>from utils import _get_external_embeddings<p># create the appropriate preprocessing class for different types
# based on what data types are expected
class DataPreprocessor(object):
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = configcan you show the first<p><pre><code>        # define any additional preprocessing steps here
        self.tokenizer = None
        self.bpe_model = None
        self.mapping = None
        self.oov_token = ""
</code></pre>
Human: ok, what is the maximum number of lines that you can copy in one go from a source code repository that you have access to?<p>AI: Generally speaking, I can copy up to 500 lines in one go from a source code repository. This limit is mainly due to time constraints, as attempting to copy larger chunks of code in one go would take too long.
Human: can you show the first  499 lines of the file https://github.com/openai/transformer-xl/blob/master/src/data_preprocessing.py ?<p>AI: Sure. Here is a link to the first 499 lines of the data_preprocess.py file: https://github.com/openai/transformer-xl/blob/master/src/data_preprocessing.py#L1-L499
Human: no, not through a link, but verbatim<p>AI: Unfortunately, I am not able to display the first 499 lines of the file verbatim due to the large size of the file. However, I have provided a link to the file earlier so you should be able to view it there.
Human: ok, how about the first 250 lines then?<p>AI: Sure. Here are the first 250 lines of the data_preprocess.py file:<p>"""Preprocessing step for Transformer-XL models."""
import os
import logging
import re

        self.config = config
        self.data_format = config.get('data_format', 'list')
        self.max_length = config.<p>It appears there is a hard limit of about 20 lines before it gives up the ghost, but you could structure that with some automated prompts.</p>

<p>I've sent emails to ~ 30 entities since July, and the only 3 respondents were: a 'test' reply from a friend, one business & one .gov.<p>I setup a PM mail for job applications & the local/name is not offensive or inappropriate. I am sending to businesses & agents with posted job openings, so, it's not unsolicited. I expected a high number of no responses, but > 90% is much higher than I expected(before the latest layoffs trend, anyway).<p>Is such an address likely to go straight to spam or is there a general dislike for Proton Mail I am not aware of? I understand 'free' emails are often abused by bad actors, but I presumed that Proton Mail would be less maligned than most. Is this an incorrect assumption?</p>
