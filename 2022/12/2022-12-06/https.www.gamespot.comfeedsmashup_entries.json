Then again, there are also shows that just aren't very good or managed to escape being noticed at all because of the crowded streaming landscape.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Whatever the case, 2022 is no different. Already, we've seen so many shows get the ax, pointing to what will likely be a very busy year on the cutting room floor. After all, there are more streaming services than ever, and they're all trying their hand at original programming. So even some of the most hyped shows aren't making it beyond their initial seasons. Who can forget that both Cowboy Bebop and Y: The Last Man were canceled fairly quickly after their respective premieres?</p><p>Are your favorite shows safe? What's been canceled so far? And, honestly, is any TV show safe? Those are the questions we're trying to answer. Take a look below at every single TV show that's been canceled so far in 2022. And while we're at it, make sure to check out the surprising number of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/a-look-at-every-tv-show-canceled-in-2021/2900-3701/\">shows that got canned in 2021</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1.

It happens without fail, a new slew of TV shows are canceled, some beloved, others less so. Some shows go away without getting a proper ending to their story, while others get a planned conclusion that won't leave us hanging. Once upon a time, it was surprising to see streaming service giant Netflix adding shows to the list, but those days have come and gone.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Now, Netflix cancels a decently long list of shows practically every year. While many of them didn't get past the first season or two, there are also long-running shows that meet their end because, well, TV shows simply can't go on forever. After all, the kids on Stranger Things aren't exactly kids anymore. How much longer could Netflix have realistically expected to see them run around Hawkins chasing monsters?</p><p>With that in mind, we're taking a look at every show Netflix has canceled this year. Thankfully, we're getting the satisfaction of some of these shows playing out in full (and they may not even technically end this year, depending on how release schedules play out). Others, though, are simply gone too soon. After you've made it through this list, make sure to check out our recap of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-26-tv-shows-canceled-in-2022-so-far/2900-3928/\">every show canceled across the network and streaming landscape this year</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1.

The <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-3-1-0\">update</a>, which arrives December 12, will adjust the spaces between flags on Manifest across Battlefield 2042's main game modes in order to reduce travel time and create stronger frontlines. Various points of interest across the map will be updated too, with locations like the Weather Station and Container Yard sporting new looks.

With its non-stop flurry of nostalgia and laid-back gameplay similar to Nintendo's Animal Crossing franchise, this cozy life sim is destined to continue being a popular choice among genre enthusiasts.</p><p>Dreamlight Valley's Star Paths--developer Gameloft's own approach to Battle Passes--have been one of the major things keeping things interesting, too, with chances to earn themed cosmetics and decorations for your valley.

Now, with the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-everything-new-in-the-winter-update/1100-6509681/\">December 6 update</a>, Gameloft has introduced its third Star Path,</p><p>The brand new Festive Star Path costs 2,500 Moonstones, but you can earn them back within the reward track if you complete everything. Like previous Star Paths, this one requires you to complete a variety of tasks around your valley to earn tokens that you can then use to unlock the rewards you want. Most of these tasks are fairly straightforward, if a bit grindy, and you shouldn't have any trouble knocking them out.</p><p>If you're looking for some holiday cheer, the Festive Star Path may be right up your alley thanks to its large variety of festive offerings, including an adorable new fox critter, all kinds of joyful holiday items, and some new clothing options for Mickey and Merlin. If you're curious about all the items and cosmetics that the Festive Star Path contains before diving in, though, we've got you covered below.

Most notably, performance has been improved across all consoles, with special attention paid to the Nintendo Switch version, which has been plagued with framerate problems and crashes since release. Loading screens and installation sizes have also been reduced across the board.</p><p>Elsewhere, Kristoff's stall now sells a few new items, including the much-requested iron ingots, which means much less time spent chipping away at mining nodes for materials. Additionally, critters can now be fed multiple times a day to ease the grind of earning them as <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-companions-list/1100-6508842/\">companions</a>. And wood spawns have been changed to be biome-specific rather than random, meaning you'll finally be able to farm a particular type of wood based on which area you're visiting. Lastly, a day/night toggle has been added to the game, which should be especially helpful for those who only get to play at certain times of the day.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-everything-new-in-the-winter-update/1100-6509681/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-pc-games-of-2022-according-to-metacritic/2900-4484/", "title": "The Best PC Games Of 2022 According To Metacritic", "date_published": "2022-12-06 14:00:00+00:00", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4069303-bestpcgamesmetacritic.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">It has been a fascinating year for PC gaming, as the platform has shown off its strength as a versatile system for all manner of games. Between original games finding an audience through early-access programs, plenty of ports, and hundreds of indie titles, it was easy to be paralyzed with choice in 2022 if you were a PC gamer.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">One of the more noteworthy stories in the PC gaming space this year was the number of PlayStation ports that were made available. Sony has traditionally kept its titles exclusively on its PlayStation consoles, but this year, it released an even greater number of PS4 and PS5 games on PC thanks to the efforts of specialist studio Nixxes. God of War, Insomniac's Spider-Man games, and Uncharted all made a big splash, looking better than ever when rendered with the right hardware.</p><p>So which games were, according to the numbers from GameSpot's sister site<a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/year/pc/filtered\"> Metacritic</a>, the best then? The most critically acclaimed titles for 2022 encompass a wide variety of genres, studios, and ideas, but if there is a running theme here, it's that games with rich stories and strong narratives were the most beloved by critics and players. We've rounded up the best-scoring games of the year below, with the top spot going not to Elden Ring, but rather a game that many consider to be the best work of interactive fiction that Japanese developer Atlus has ever produced.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Persona 5 Royal</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4067976-persona5%283%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Persona 5 has been one of the most captivating JRPGs since it first launched in 2016, and with its latest upgrade, it won't be losing that title anytime soon.

However, if you're looking for the definitive way to experience it, look no further than Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A remake of the 2007 PSP exclusive Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, Crisis Core Reunion is a faithful retelling of Zack Fair's story with dramatic visual upgrades, full voice acting, and several quality-of-life changes. Considering the game was already heralded as a fantastic prequel and one of the best titles on PSP, it comes as little surprise that this version is triumphant in making Crisis Core into a modern day must-play for Final Fantasy VII fans.

However, once information regarding the various experiments Shinra conducted on these elite warriors begins to surface, the four colleagues quickly find themselves at odds with each other. Inevitably, these tensions set into motion the events of Final Fantasy VII, including Sephiroth's turn toward madness, the burning of Nibelheim, and Cloud's involvement in the whole ordeal.

At a time when most other racing games are striving for photorealism, EA's latest distinguishes itself from the rest of the grid by adopting a stylized mix between reality and comic books. While its cars land on the side of realism, the characters behind the wheel are cel-shaded and its open world falls somewhere in between the two aesthetics. Vivid graffiti-style flourishes also pop up when you activate nitrous or fly off a ramp, and drifting kicks up colorful tire smoke that looks hand-drawn, with all of these effects punctuating the action with a unique sense of style.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There aren't any modern racing games that look quite like it, yet the rest of Unbound feels like a continuation of 2019's Need for Speed Heat. From the distinction between day and night races to the cat-and-mouse chase that occurs when you have to outrun the cops and make it to a safe house in order to bank your money. Unbound doesn't attempt to reinvent the wheel, but what's here maintains the series' recent quality, even if there are some wrong turns along the way.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As is now customary in Need for Speed games, Unbound features a rather forgettable story about getting back at a former friend who stole your ride. There's little point in delving into details because, ultimately, it's inconsequential. Cutscenes are sprinkled in every now and then, but for the most part, the story is just sort of <em>there</em>, happening in the background as you drive around the city, so at least it's unobtrusive. There's some fun incidental dialogue every now and then, including one mission where you're traveling with a \"weeb racer\" who spends the whole journey telling you about the history of anime and how it definitely isn't a cartoon. Rapper A$AP Rocky also makes an appearance (because why not?) and it feels like he was given a microphone and free rein to say whatever came to mind. It's a moment that stands out in a game that's filled to the brim with ancillary dialogue. Aside from this, the story is relatively easy to ignore, but it does succeed in giving impetus to the game's structure.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/need-for-speed-unbound-review-comic-book-racing/1900-6418010/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}]
