## Ramos hits hat-trick as Portugal thrash Switzerland 6-1 after Ronaldo dropped

<p>You drop Cristiano Ronaldo and the man you pick instead of him best not miss. Gonçalo Ramos is 21. He made his international debut last month. Before Tuesday he had only played 36 minutes of international football. And yet within 17 minutes he had already scored more World Cup knockout goals than Ronaldo; by midway through the second half he’d scored the first hat-trick of Qatar 2022. Fernando Santos could hardly have been more obviously vindicated. Ramos, emphatically, did not miss, setting up a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/06/morocco-spain-world-cup-last-16-match-report">quarter-final against Morocco</a>.</p><p>Santos has the rumpled air of a man who has slept in his car. He could be Elliott Gould playing Columbo. He is not a man who has ever willingly done anything interesting, so when the day before the game he had criticised Ronaldo for his shushing gesture after being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/02/south-korea-portugal-world-cup-group-h-match-report">substituted against South Korea</a>, it felt significant. Ronaldo himself claimed it was directed at the South Korean forward Cho Gue-sung, who was trying to chivvy him off the pitch but, given similar situations at Manchester United, the widespread assumption in Portugal seems to be that it was aimed at his critics, of whom there are a growing number. A poll in the sports daily A Bola suggested 70% of readers thought he should not start against the Swiss.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/06/portugal-switzerland-world-cup-last-16-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>And so, in the end, it was down to him. After two tense, exhausting hours, and seven agonising minutes on the edge, Achraf Hakimi stood on the spot, the whole world watching. Born in Madrid, his was the sixth penalty in the shootout, the chance to send Morocco through to the quarter-finals of the World Cup for the first time in their history – and eliminate the country where he grew up. Pressure, what pressure? Hakimi barely broke into a run, instead virtually walking to the ball, and gently dinking it into the net.</p><p>Standing there, he shuffled from side to side and smiled. In front of him, Morocco’s fans went wild. Behind him, his teammates were sprinting straight at him. Together they ran towards the corner, where Bono, their goalkeeper and their hero, was waiting, arms wide. And then they fell to fell to the floor and prayed. History had been made, and how they had fought for it. An upset in the knockouts.

<p>Targets and details of referrals in investigation of Capitol attack were not immediately clear but could follow two tracks</p><p>The House January 6 select committee will make criminal referrals to the US justice department in connection with its investigation into the Capitol attack, the chairman of the panel said Tuesday, heightening tensions ahead of the release of its final report expected to come later this month.<br /><br />The targets and details about the referrals were not immediately clear, and the panel’s chairman Bennie Thompson affirmed to reporters only that the panel would issue citations.<br /><br />But the decision to move forward with referrals comes days after a special four-member subcommittee established to consider the issue recommended that the full committee seek prosecution from the justice department for a number of individuals connected to January 6, two sources said.<br /><br />The referrals could follow two tracks: citations for things that Congress can request prosecution by statute, such as perjury or witness tampering, or wider-ranging recommendations such as making the case that Donald Trump obstructed an official proceeding on 6 January.<br /><br />The four-member subcommittee led by Congressman Jamie Raskin and the other members with legal backgrounds – the vice-chair Liz Cheney, Adam Schiff and Zoe Lofgren – made its recommendations about referrals and subpoena noncompliance by Republican members of Congress privately on Friday.<br /><br />“The committee has determined that referrals to outside entities should be considered as a final part of its work.

<p>Wizard from Oz’s early highs seem a long time ago with control freak wearing staff down and stodge failing to appease fans</p><p>Sometimes it is the small things that betray the real story. There we were last Saturday week, in the subterranean depths of Twickenham’s vast West Stand, listening to Eddie Jones explaining away England’s latest sub-par performance. To his right, as ever, was his faithful Australian lieutenant Neil Craig, hired specifically to help Jones to cope with such tricky situations. Even a weary-looking Craig, on this occasion, had his head in his hands.</p><p>The other giveaway was the remarkable online outburst last week by David Pembroke, Jones’s long-time media guru, in the comments section on the Times Sport website. “Pemby” was alleging the Rugby Football Union itself had been briefing against Jones and publicly referred to the RFU’s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, as “slippery”. If there was a slim chance of Jones batting on into 2023 it probably vanished right there, despite Pembroke’s subsequent apology.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/06/from-magician-to-misfit-where-it-all-went-wrong-for-eddie-jones">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Cadogan Hall, London<br /></strong>The contemporary works were unengaging, but the Romanian Orchestra’s Tchaikovsky enthralled, and Vengerov’s bravura reading of Prokofiev’s First Violin Concerto closed the concert in spectacular style</p><p>Billed as a <a href="https://www.maximvengerov.com/">Maxim Vengerov</a> gala, this programme of popular classics was also a showcase for the Romanian National Philharmonic Orchestra, the somewhat grandiose touring name for the <a href="https://www.filarmonicabrasov.ro/">Brașov Philharmonic</a>. A fine, disciplined ensemble, they hail from Romania’s seventh most populous city, located slap bang in the middle of Transylvania. Under Armenian conductor <a href="https://sergeysmbatyan.com/">Sergey Smbatyan</a>, their robust performance grew in stature as the evening progressed.</p><p>The first half got off to a spirited start with Sibelius’s perennial Karelia Suite. The central Ballade brought out the burnished earthiness of the RNPO’s lower strings, though the Intermezzo could have been lighter on its feet. Tchaikovsky’s Romeo and Juliet Fantasy-Overture was more enthralling, with Smbatyan part urgent, part cajoling, crafting the kind of imaginative and dynamic phrasing the Sibelius somehow lacked.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/06/romanian-national-philharmonic-orchsmbatyan-review-vengerovs-virtuoisty-raises-the-temperature">Continue reading...</a>

With her husband and band partner Alan Sparhawk, Parker was responsible for one of the most downbeat festive albums ever made: Christmas, from 1999. From its spectral version of Little Drummer Boy to a cover of Blue Christmas sung at what sounds like half-speed, its eight tracks remained faithful to the Minnesota band’s melancholic indie sound. The opener begins with this harrowing observation about Jesus’s birthday: “If you were born today, we’d kill you by age eight.”</p><p>It’s one of the most sorrowful-sounding seasonal albums ever – but also one of the best. Little surprise if it has passed you by: we don’t pay nearly enough attention to the gift of truly sad Christmas songs. When compiling yuletide playlists, we prefer the manically jolly over the miserable. We’re happy to hear Noddy Holder screaming like an axe-wielding killer, but something approaching the true loneliness, grief and <em>weltschmerz</em> of the darkest time of the year?

<p><strong>PC; Bay 12/Kitfox</strong><br />A graphical overhaul offers a gentler way of playing this vast, strange strategy game of staggering intricacy</p><p>The idea of reviewing Dwarf Fortress is inherently hilarious. You might as well apply a tape measure to a black hole. Playable in unfinished form for 16 years and counting, with no end to development in sight, Bay 12’s deceptively lo-fi colony management simulation is as vast and alien as one of its own Forgotten Beasts, rising up through layers of terrain to obliterate the miners burrowing down for sapphires and platinum.</p><p>It’s better understood through the stories whispered about individual, player-created fortresses, preserved in the amber chambers of online forums. The tragi-comedy of <a href="https://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/Update%201-20/">Boatmurdered</a> – almost doomed when a butterfly flew into a door mechanism, granting access to bloodthirsty elephants. The horror of <a href="https://brokenforum.com/index.php?threads/dwarf-fortress-vd-staying-dry.1003/">Glazedcoast</a>, where the puppy pies are always extra-flakey. The humble history of Paddledclimax, my own creation, flooded when I tunnelled through a riverbed to escape a goblin siege. Tales from the trenches like these sell the game’s fecundity more compellingly than any overview. Still, the release of a relatively accessible Steam edition, published by Kitfox, is as good an opportunity as any to assess the whole.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/dec/06/dwarf-fortress-review-a-grand-chronicle-of-inevitable-disaster">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From the Brexit department to the Foreign Office, the deputy PM has been remarkably consistent in his focus on all the wrong things</p><p>I want to begin this column with an apology. When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/20/dominic-raab-foreign-secretary-global-britain">Dominic Raab</a> and his forehead vein first throbbed into the public consciousness as one of the many Brexit secretaries during Theresa May’s rolling malfunction of an administration, I note I simply regarded him as the sort of “tightly wound” white-collar loner who owned a number of lockups with chest freezers at whose contents one could only shudderingly guess. What was I thinking? Merely, I guess, that Raab would one day be played by Jonny Lee Miller in a three-star ITV psychological thriller called Something Wicked This Way Comes. That now feels naive to the point of twee. It has this week been placed on the record that Dominic Raab is in fact the sort of man whose obsession with correctly formatted documents left his officials being told that “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/dec/05/afghans-died-because-of-dominic-raab-delay-in-reviewing-documents-officials-told">people had died</a>” during the UK’s chaotic evacuation from Afghanistan last year.</p><p>Back then, Raab was foreign secretary. He is now back at justice, after Brandon Lewis <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-justice-secretary-agrees-deal-to-get-criminal-barristers-back-to-work">found the resolution</a> to the barristers’ strike that had eluded Raab, during the 27-minute Liz Truss interregnum. Has Dominic’s return to the department been met with bouquets and tearful euphoria? In short, no, although I believe there have been tears.

## Nutcracker Massacre review – a slow slay ride to nowhere in yuletide slasher flick

<p>This seasonal slash-fest starring Patrick Bergin is a plodding and unimaginative addition to the anti-Christmas genre</p><p>This yuletide slasher movie is about as enjoyable as being force-fed a Christmas tree and having it violently pipeclean your insides. It joins <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/12/black-christmas-review-remake-unscary-mess">Black Christmas</a>, Bad Santa and this year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/01/violent-night-review-david-harbour-bad-santa">Violent Night</a> in the anti-Christmas oeuvre – but its placeholder characters, this’ll-do dialogue and mechanical gallery of kills show that seasonal subversion alone won’t cut it.</p><p>Novelist Clara (Beatrice Fletcher) is reeling from her boyfriend Paul (Andy Dixon) cheating on her and decides to bunker down at the country manor of Auntie Marie (Julie Stevens) for the holidays. She needn’t worry too much, though, being a “timeless beauty”, as the local antiques dealer tells her – before fiendishly tweaking his moustache and flogging her a Nutcracker doll as a gift. But when she gets to her destination, it turns out her aunt has gone one better: there is already a 6ft Nutcracker lurking behind the tree. When midnight strikes on Christmas Eve, the wooden soldier’s eyes come ablaze, just as an unfortunate delivery man turns up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/06/nutcracker-massacre-review-a-slow-slay-ride-to-nowhere-in-yuletide-slasher-flick">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We don’t know yet what’s behind the spate of strep A deaths, but we can do more to protect children</p><ul><li>Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</li></ul><p>With Covid-19 dominating the news for almost three years, it’s easy to forget the other infectious diseases that still cause us problems. Strep A has been making news headlines because <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/04/strep-a-parents-told-to-be-vigilant-after-seventh-child-in-uk-reported-to-have-died">eight children have died</a> of it in England and Wales, plus one in Northern Ireland. And in Scotland, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-63845497">437 children</a> were recorded as having strep A in the past two weeks, putting it on par with the 2017/18 season, albeit much earlier in the winter.</p><p>Strep A is a common infection in children and most cases are mild or asymptomatic. But on rare occasions, some cases cause scarlet fever and strep throat and bacteria gets into the bloodstream and lungs, causing sepsis. The rising numbers of infections and deaths have understandably caused anxiety among parents. Early signs of strep A can look similar to a range of other infections, and it spreads easily among children via sneezing and coughing, or through touching. This makes it a difficult disease to contain during an indoor mixing and party season, and clinically it is hard to diagnose strep A at an early stage when it is seen in primary care.</p><p>Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Luka Modric was the standout player in Russia four years ago, but his Croatia side fell at the final hurdle. The same happened to Lionel Messi in 2014, and the winner of the Golden Ball in 2010, Diego Forlán, didn’t even reach the final. In fact, one has to go back to Romário at USA 94 to find the last player to have taken home both the title and the award for best player.</p><p>The same is true of the Golden Boot. In the last 40 years, only Ronaldo in 2002 has finished top scorer while also winning the tournament. More recently, top scorers – such as James Rodríguez in 2014 and Harry Kane in 2018 – have played in sides who have left far less of an impression on the tournament. Not since Paolo Rossi at the 1982 World Cup has a player won the Golden Ball, Golden Boot and World Cup. Before that only Garrincha in 1962 and Mario Kempes had completed the trio.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/06/kylian-mbappe-world-cup-golden-boot-golden-ball-paolo-rossi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The court is hearing a case that could allow the kind of naked discrimination that the gay rights and civil rights movements fought so hard to end</p><p>It’s not clear what, exactly, Lorie Smith’s problem is. The Colorado woman aspires to be a web designer; apparently, she’s also upset that gay people can get married.

## Georgia senate voters have a moral choice. White Christians are choosing hypocrisy | Steve Phillips

<p>Evangelicals show their true colors in voting for a Republican mired in unchristian scandal </p><p>Why do we have such low expectations for white voters? The midterm elections brought into stark relief just how many white voters are willing to make a mockery of showing any pretense of concern for democracy, good governance or even the barest qualifications for our country’s highest offices. As unfortunate as that behavior is, what’s even more dangerous for the future of the country is how resigned the rest of the country has become to the anti-democratic and intellectually unjustifiable voting patterns of much of white America.</p><p>On one level, we shouldn’t be surprised because white Americans have been voting against whatever political party is aligned with Black people for more than a century – the civil war itself began when seven slaveholding states, all dominated by the Democratic party, refused to accept the outcome of the 1860 election, seceded from the Union and launched a violent and bloody war. While many would like to believe that such whites-first electoral decision-making is a thing of the past, the most recent midterm elections reveal just how little progress has been made.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/06/georgia-senate-vote-white-christians-walker-warnock">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is sharp social commentary in this fashion forward chiller but Lorcan Finnegan’s film is let down by a plot revelation visible from space</p><p>In the nicest possible way, Eva Green can suggest demonic possession with the merest arch of an eyebrow, or a wolfish flash of teeth. She is such a dark heart that when she turns up in this film playing a children’s fashion designer, I half expected her to gobble up one of the little darlings whole. But no, she is not the angel of death in this politically engaged London-set horror. Not to begin with at least; that role belongs to a Filipina housekeeper called Diana (Chai Fonacier).</p><p>Nocebo opens with Green’s designer Christine putting on a fashion show. As the kids bounce up the runway, she takes a phone call. Her face slackens as she repeats the horror of what she’s hearing (“… pulling out bodies?”). Eight months later, jittery and on edge, Christine seems to be recovering from a breakdown. But, on the bright side, she’s got a commission from a kidswear company that plasters its cheap prices across adverts: “T-shirt £3”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/06/nocebo-review-unsettling-horror-puts-eva-green-under-the-spell-of-a-housekeeper">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Latest updates: Mick Lynch says unions have ‘duty to coordinate’ as workers face ‘paltry pay rises’</p><p>And here are some more lines from <strong>Mick Lynch</strong>’s interview this morning on the Today programme.</p><p><strong>Lynch, the RMT general secretary, said the government was to blame for not allowing the train companies to make an offer acceptable to his members. </strong>He said:</p><p>The government are running the playbook and the strategy for the railway companies and directing what is going on. They have held back even these paltry offers to the last minute.</p><p><strong>He claimed the rail companies were not losing out from strike action, because they were subsidised by the government, and he described this system as “perverse and corrupt”. </strong>He explained:</p><p>They get indemnified for every day of strike action. They are paid the money that they would otherwise have lost, and the only people that lose are my members who lose their wages and the public and these businesses in hospitality who lose their income as well, while the people I negotiate with lose no money whatsoever.</p><p>It is the most perverse and corrupt system we have ever seen in British business where those people that are conducting the dispute make no losses whatsoever and the taxpayer subsidises those people by money given directly from the DfT [Department for Transport].</p><p><strong>He said the timing of the latest strikes was “unfortunate”, but he claimed the union was forced to act. </strong>He said:</p><p>We have to respond to what the companies are doing, and they’re doing that very deliberately. They’re seeking to ratchet up the dispute.</p><p><strong>He accepted that, although the additional strikes were over Christmas, when rail services were very minimal anyway, they would create further disruption for passengers. </strong>In the past Lynch had said the RMT <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/rmt-rail-strikes-union-christmas-trains-mick-lynch-b1045093.html">wanted to avoid strike action over Christmas.</a></p><p><strong>He defended the RMT’s decision to object to a move to driver-only trains. </strong>Driver-only operation was “less safe”, he said. Women and disabled passengers wanted to see guards on trains, he said, because they felt that was safer and more welcoming. When the presenter, <strong>Justin Webb</strong>, put it to Lynch that driver-only trains still had another member of staff on board, and that they just did not have a staff member operating the doors, Lynch said that was wrong. He said most of these services did not have anyone else on board, apart from the driver.</p><p>I would say to the unions, we do understand, of course, the cost that families up and down the country are facing as a consequence of higher energy prices and the cost of living going up, but this is not the way to negotiate. </p><p>They need to get around the table, talk to the employers and come up with a settlement, not hold the country to ransom, not disrupt people’s Christmas plans. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/dec/06/rmt-mick-lynch-christmas-rail-strikes-rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-uk-politics-latest">Continue reading...</a>

Hamish was one of the most colourful and creative musicians we have been lucky to work with, both as a singer, guitarist and songwriter with the group he started with Lisa Siegel, the Mad Scene, and, of course, with the Clean.

<p>I really like them and they say they fancy me. But I’m not getting what I need</p><p><strong>I’m a gay man in my mid-20s. I’ve been seeing someone for almost </strong><strong>two months and we’ve slept together </strong><strong>a handful of times</strong><strong>. Despite hanging out for the past two weeks, though, we haven’t</strong><strong> had sex. The other night I tried to initiate and was rejected</strong><strong>; they </strong><strong>said they were tired. I brought up my frustration and queried whether they actually fancied me. They </strong><strong>were shocked that I’d question whether they fancied me and brushed it off. I left that night and received </strong><strong>a grovelling apology by text, but that just made me feel worse. I felt </strong><strong>as if I was guilting someone into having sex with me, which isn’t exactly sexy. But I also recognise that my wants in the bedroom aren’t being met. I’m not sure if it’s worth carrying on with this relationship</strong><strong>, but I really like the person. Are we incompatible?</strong></p><p>You don’t yet know each other well at all, so it’s far too early to know about compatibility. Is it not possible that they actually <em>were</em> tired the other night? Fatigue, stress and overwork can greatly affect a person’s sexual desire and arousal. Let’s say you were oversensitive and took it as a rejection – ask yourself if this is a familiar pattern for you. If we are open to it, we can learn more about ourselves with each relationship, each experience, and this process of self-discovery is thankfully lifelong. Perhaps the lesson here is that you are expecting a lot for such a new liaison. Consider what it is you really want and need at this point in your life. If you are simply in the market for great, uncomplicated and brief sexual encounters with people who are always ready, understand that you are bound to be disappointed some percentage of the time. And you may also miss out on the pleasures of true intimacy in a deeper relationship. But you say that you “really like the person”. Let that be your guide. Try to get to know each other better generally. Sex can wax and wane, but likability can be a vital marker for relationship longevity.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

<p>Ministers have shattered the legal system and are failing to tackle the climate crisis. Now they are making protesters their scapegoats </p><p>Indigo Rumbelow is an activist with Just Stop Oil</p><p>It’s a strange paradox. The tougher that Tory home secretaries talk, the faster law and order seems to break down. Whoever’s in the role – Grant Shapps, Priti Patel, Suella Braverman – the same rhetoric grinds on, day after day: cracking down, clamping down, demanding tougher action. Now the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has joined in, reportedly launching “Operation Get Tough” and demanding the police use all the new powers available to them through the latest sweep of anti-protest laws.</p><p>Who’s listening? Certainly not us. Just Stop Oil knows first-hand that the legal system is collapsing. Some of our supporters’ cases can’t even be heard until 2024. Many of my<strong> </strong>friends will spend this Christmas in prison, most held without a trial, on remand. Jan Goodey, the first person to be convicted under the government’s new Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/29/just-stop-oil-activist-sentenced-to-six-months-in-prison-for-motorway-disruption">sentenced</a> to six months in prison just last week, the first of many protesters who will probably be criminalised for caring. Instead of facing up to the challenge of ending new oil and gas, the government would prefer to silence the alarm bells.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/06/just-stop-oil-suella-braverman-climate-breakdown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Donors like Peter Thiel poured millions into candidates that no amount of money could sell to voters while Mehmet Oz self-funded a failed run</p><p>With the power balance in Congress at stake in this year’s midterm elections, the GOP money machine kicked into high gear. Spending on advertisements and drumming up votes was fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars from the party’s mega-donors and Super Pacs. Many donors’ spending figures marked new records.</p><p>Their return on investment, however, is probably not what they had hoped: some donors who spent eight figures notched zero wins in the Senate, while others spent far more money on losing candidates than winners.

## Hilma af Klint: A Biography by Julia Voss review – portrait of the painter as a mystic

<p>The Swedish abstract artist who conversed with the dead is described as a woman years ahead of her time in this scholarly, sympathetic study</p><p>The voices in her head told Hilma af Klint she would be a great artist. They weren’t wrong. Born in 1862, she was unusual from an early age. Growing up in austere Lutheran Sweden, Af Klint studied art at university: a rare feat for a woman. Even less common was her insistence on practising as a professional after graduation. In the face of a society – and an art world – riddled with extreme misogyny, a quiet, conventional career in portraiture seemed the best she could hope for. But then, as Julia Voss reveals in her new biography, Af Klint started to receive messages from another world – and her life in this one was irrevocably altered.</p><p>In 1906, she began the construction of an extraordinary series of 1,200 paintings, which she continued until her death in 1944. Reproduced in colour in Voss’s book, the work is still novel, a century or so on. Which wouldn’t have surprised Af Klint. Her visions told her that she was making art for people of the future.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/06/hilma-af-klint-a-biography-by-julia-voss-review-portrait-of-the-painter-as-a-mystic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Three months after the uprising began, demonstrators are still risking their lives. Will this generation succeed where previous attempts to unseat the Islamic hardliners have been crushed? </p><p>For the past 12 weeks, revolutionary sentiment has been coursing through the cities and towns of the Persian plateau. The agitation was triggered by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2022/oct/31/mapping-irans-unrest-how-mahsa-aminis-death-led-to-nationwide-protests" title="">death of Mahsa Amini</a>, a young Kurdish woman, on 16 Septe mber after she was arrested by the morality police in Tehran. From the outset the movement had a feminist character, but it has also united citizens of different classes and ethnicities around a shared desire to see the back of the Islamic Republic. Iran has known numerous protest movements over the past decade and a half, and the nation’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has comfortably suppressed each one with a combination of severity and deft exploitation of divisions within the opposition. This time, however, the resilience and unity shown by the regime’s opponents have consigned the old pattern of episodic unrest to the past. Iran has entered a period of rolling protest in which the Islamic Republic must defend itself against wave upon wave of public anger.</p><p>In their retaliation against the protesters, the security forces have killed at least <a href="https://iranhr.net/en/articles/5608/" title="">448 people</a>, including 60 children and 29 women, and made up to 17,000 arrests. Thirty-six protesters have been charged with capital crimes, according to Hadi Ghaemi of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran, including several people accused of killing members of the security forces. Still, the authorities insist that they have erred on the side of restraint. On 9 November the commander of Iran’s ground forces warned that Khamenei only needed to say the word and the opposition “flies” would “without question have no place left in the country”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/06/irans-moment-of-truth-what-will-it-take-for-the-people-to-topple-the-regime">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Itamar Ben-Gvir has spent a lifetime on the fringes of Israeli politics. He was once considered so extreme that he wasn’t allowed to serve in the Israeli army. Now he is the country’s security minister. Bethan McKernan reports</p><p>If you’ve paid any attention to Israeli politics in the past few years, you will have been following the rise, fall and rise again of Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel’s longest-serving prime minister is still facing trial on corruption charges but is now due to return to office after the most recent election, the fifth in four years.</p><p>As Jerusalem correspondent <strong>Bethan McKernan </strong>tells <strong>Michael Safi, </strong>in a country where politics has been chaotic for years, the return of Netanyahu promises more instability. There is no progress towards ending an occupation of Palestinian territory now in its sixth decade – indeed, a resolution that both sides could accept seems further away than ever. But this time, it’s the man who helped to put Netanyahu back in power who is getting the most attention.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/dec/06/the-far-right-radical-in-israel-new-government-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

Officials said airstrikes destroyed homes in the south, knocked out power in the north and killed at least two people.</p><p>Russia’s defence ministry said <strong>Ukrainian drones attacked two airbases at Ryazan and Saratov in south-central Russia,</strong> killing three servicemen and wounding four, with two aircraft damaged.

It said components from 30 European and American companies, including antenna parts from Tallysman Wireless, a Canadian manufacturer, were used in Shahed 136 drones.</p><p>The White House has said the latest Russian strikes against Ukraine are a<strong> reminder of Vladimir Putin’s brutality. </strong>John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, also told reporters that an oil price cap would not have any long-term impact on global oil prices, Reuters reported.</p><p>Moldovan police on Monday found <strong>fragments of a missile</strong> in a northern region near the border with Ukraine, state information portal Prima Sursa quoted the police as saying after Russia carried out missile strikes.</p><p><strong>Russia’s recent mobilisation increased its military threat in Ukraine, </strong>with better-trained soldiers arriving at the frontline, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces said. But Russia was using a lot of old equipment because it had no other way of replenishing supplies, and the Russians had made only slow progress around Bakhmut, one of the main battle zones in eastern Ukraine, Reuters reported.</p><p><strong>Vladimir Putin has driven across the Kerch Bridge linking Russia and the Crimean peninsula </strong>that was damaged by a truck bomb in October.<strong> </strong>The Russian president spoke to workers and a senior government official, Reuters reported.</p><p><strong>India gave a list of its products to Moscow for access to Russian markets, </strong>foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said, as his country seeks to narrow a growing trade deficit with Russia at a time when Moscow faces acute shortages of some crucial materials after western sanctions.</p><p><strong>The Kremlin <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russian-oil-cap-comes-into-force-kyiv-resumes-rolling-power-outages?page=with:block-638dc6408f082ef70a2453e0#block-638dc6408f082ef70a2453e0">has warned</a> the new western price cap on Russian oil will destabilise global energy markets, </strong>but claimed it would not affect its invasion of Ukraine.
