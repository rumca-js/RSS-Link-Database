Ditto for Google Bookmarks. Now, all you need to do is to simply type in <strong>@bookmarks</strong>, <strong>@tabs</strong>, or <strong>@history</strong> into the Google address bar to search those functions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you do, you&rsquo;ll see the Google address bar reflect your choice, with a blue textual indicator that you&rsquo;re searching through your browsing history, for example. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Searching for your available tabs is a bit less useful, as Chrome will automatically offer to take you to a tab if it detects it&rsquo;s already open. For example, you <em>can</em> type in &ldquo;<strong>@tabs</strong>&rdquo; and then &ldquo;<strong>PCWorld laptop</strong> <strong>reviews</strong>&rdquo; for example. But if you have a tab open showing PCWorld&rsquo;s laptop reviews page, you&rsquo;ll see a &ldquo;Switch to this tab&rdquo; button if you simply type that in the address bar instead. (Microsoft Edge also uses this same &ldquo;Switch to this tab&rdquo; motif.) </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Google Chrome search history via address bar\" class=\"wp-image-1427430\" height=\"904\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Google-Chrome-Search-history.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, being able to search open tabs is a godsend, as I always have multiple tabs (as in, about 50 or so) at any one time.  I also tend to open multiple windows with groups of tabs, close them in an effort to clean up my desktop, and then forget that I closed something I needed. A quick search of the browser history should solve that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, make sure that you have your browser updated to access these new Google Chrome features. This feature was only enabled after I updated Chrome to version 108.0.5359.95.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nBrowsers</div>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1427190/smuggler-hides-200-intel-cpus-in-a-fake-baby-bump.html", "title": "Smuggler hides 202 Intel CPUs in a fake \u2018baby bump\u2019", "date_published": "2022-12-06 16:52:31+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Air travel while pregnant is never easy.

The <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html\">GeForce RTX 4080</a> in particular is priced way, <em>way</em> above both its AMD competition and the usual MSRP bump from previous Nvidia generations. While it&rsquo;s a bit early to call the 4080 a flop, early indications from the retail world seem to show that PC gamers &mdash; and even GPU scalpers &mdash; aren&rsquo;t interested. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stock for the $1200 card seems to be high at brick-and-mortar stores and web outlets alike, with many tech sites <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/z9loyf/market_isnt_what_i_thought_i_hope_this_guy_is/&amp;xcust=2-2-1427125-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">and even Reddit users</a> noting the ease at which you can find the ostensibly hot item. Prices on eBay are hovering around retail for cards from OEM partners like Gigabyte, PNY, and Zotac, and even the usually-coveted Nvidia &ldquo;Founder&rsquo;s Edition&rdquo; cards are sitting in the Buy It Now section for days at a time. A year ago, even these overpriced cards would have been flying off listings like the heatsinks were made of gold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The heart of the problem is the RTX 4080&rsquo;s value proposition, or rather, its lack thereof. In his PCWorld analysis, Brad Chacos concluded that the card is <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">about $500 more expensive than it should be</a>, compared to its increase in performance of the RTX 2080-to-3080-jump. Don&rsquo;t get us wrong, the card <em>is </em>absolutely amazing for gaming <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1378383/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-content-creation-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">and content creation</a>. But after two years of monstrously inflated street prices on graphics cards have finally concluded, not to mention the lower prices for new cards from <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1370428/amd-rdna-3-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-reveal.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">both AMD</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341464/intel-arc-a770-a750-graphics-card-xe-hpg-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">and Intel</a>, it looks like the PC gaming public is largely uninterested in the GeForce RTX 4080. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia seems to have built &mdash; and priced &mdash; the RTX 40-series card on the assumption that pandemic-era GPU pricing was here to stay. That obviously didn&rsquo;t turn out to be the reality, and retailers are keenly aware of it. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techspot.com/news/96837-scalpers-struggle-sell-rtx-4080-above-msrp-but.html&amp;xcust=2-2-1427125-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">At least two Newegg listings</a> for the RTX 4080 show the card as ineligible for refund once purchased. That&rsquo;s an indication (though not proof) that buyers, presumably scalpers, are attempting to go back on their purchases in high numbers. I&rsquo;ll wait while you chase down a teeny-tiny violin, so you can play a solo for their missing profits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What can Nvidia do to fix it? The company already <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1354391/nvidia-cancels-the-controversial-rtx-4080-12gb.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">canceled the $900 version of the card</a>, which would have come with less RAM and a less powerful version of the GPU. We may see that design resurface as a rebadged RTX 4070 or 4070 Ti, but in the meantime it&rsquo;s a huge expense for Nvidia and its partners. The only other realistic option to juice sales is a price cut for the 16GB version of the card. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-price-cut/&amp;xcust=2-2-1427125-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Unconfirmed rumors</a> state that Nvidia is thinking about just such a cut later this month.

But recent holiday discounts have softened the blow with cheaper CPU pricing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where does the Asrock X670E Taichi come in? At an MSRP of $499, it&rsquo;s not a budget option&mdash;but it packs build quality and features often found on more expensive motherboards. With a feature set that will blow away both gamers and content creators, the Taichi has tons of promise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The board has a sleek, futuristic design, and outdoes itself in the hardware rundown, too. We&rsquo;ll go over the specs, features, design, and performance attributes. Does the Taichi have what it takes for a truly premium motherboard experience? Let&rsquo;s find out!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"asrock-x670e-taichi-the-specs\">Asrock X670E Taichi: The specs</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Asrock X670E Taichi\" class=\"wp-image-1421933\" height=\"620\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-11-18-at-3.14.01-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Is it a USB4 or Thunderbolt 4?

Compared to B650, you&rsquo;ll be getting more PCIe lanes, USB, and SATA ports. It&rsquo;s all DDR5, however, so plan accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It supports AMD&rsquo;s new Ryzen 7000 lineup with a completely redesigned socket, too. Yep, no more pins on the CPU like in Ryzen 5000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss the delightful unboxing experience: At $499, you&rsquo;re getting top-shelf packaging here with a windowed box so you can peep the motherboard inside. Yes, please! You also get some nice included extras: typical Wi-Fi antenna, SATA cables, and a neat M.2 fan. Oh, it&rsquo;s a big motherboard&mdash;E-ATX, wider than normal (12 x 10.5 inches).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Asrock X670E Taichi\" class=\"wp-image-1421936\" height=\"663\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-11-18-at-3.12.08-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The Asrock X670E Taichi has outstanding DDR5, but the sticker over the memory slots is questionable.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: It does come with a &ldquo;sticker&rdquo; over the RAM slots, which can leave some residue when removed.

You&rsquo;ll get two of them&mdash;it&rsquo;s typical for motherboards to offer these at the $699 level or above! Together with eight SATA ports and four onboard NVMe slots, workstation users have all they need with this rich feature set. With Wi-Fi 6E and 2.5GbE LAN included, only 10GbE is lacking. For this price, we can&rsquo;t fault Asrock for not including this option, either. Small nitpick: We&rsquo;d love to see a quick release system on the M.2 slots, as found on other premium X670E motherboards.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Asrock X670E Taichi\" class=\"wp-image-1421937\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-11-18-at-3.12.29-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Gamers are also accounted for. Power button? Yep. Reset button? Here too. How about a debug screen? Check. These are great for overclockers, but also come in handy for any user during troubleshooting and building stages. BIOS Flashback and Clear CMOS are also present, rounding off the enthusiast-grade features.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll get a healthy offering of 2x PCIe 16x slots, too. These are more than enough for a beefy GPU plus a PCIe card. Some workstation users may feel limited by having just two PCIe slots, but that&rsquo;s the trend in modern motherboards. Four onboard NVMe slots, with one being a &ldquo;blazing&rdquo; Gen 5, is a great addition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Audio is also impressive, with plenty of inputs alongside the Realtek ALC4082 codec, such as SPDIF. Short of an external USB DAC that comes with higher-end motherboards, the Taichi includes everything you&rsquo;d need for a high-level audio experience onboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"asrock-x670e-taichi-design\">Asrock X670E Taichi: Design</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Asrock X670E Taichi\" class=\"wp-image-1421939\" height=\"751\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-11-18-at-3.13.29-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Asrock X670E Taichi feels premium, period. It is one of the most creatively designed motherboards on the market. First, it looks serious and interesting with its gold &ldquo;gears&rdquo; design and silver accents. This gold motif carries through on the side of the PCIe area and works its way up to the I/O shroud. (Yep, integrated I/O shield, like we love to see!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The I/O shroud has its own charms, too. Starting in the rear, what is generally a boring USB port view, is instead a wonderfully quirky layout aesthetically. Blue and gold make a great combo here, with some of the &ldquo;gears&rdquo; theme entering as well. The VRM area means business&mdash;and that&rsquo;s exactly how the Taichi looks in its northern region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Backplates are a hallmark of premium motherboards, and found on the Taichi. It gives the board a high-quality, tactile feel when held in the hand. For RGB fans, the front is understated, with the Taichi logo lighting up nicely on the lower PCIe area, and some tasteful back lighting, too. Overall, it&rsquo;s a beautifully designed and built motherboard that is appealing for both gamers and content creators.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"asrock-x670e-taichi-performance-software-and-bios\">Asrock X670E Taichi: Performance, software, and BIOS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With a VRM phase design of 24+2+1 packing 105 amps, plus an eight-layer PCB, even the mighty Ryzen 9 7950X will find this a worthy home. The beefy VRM heatsink proves that Asrock knew to add the goods where it counts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asrock includes a &ldquo;server-grade low-loss PCB&rdquo; here, which is essential: The Taichi is tasked with handling PCIe Gen 5 16x slots alongside a Gen 5 NVMe slot. (On top of that Ryzen 9 7950X!)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll likely run into a bottleneck with your CPU cooler long before you reach any wall with the VRMs or power delivery limitations&mdash;they&rsquo;re overkill! (Most AM4 CPU coolers that use the original backplate should work fine with AM5, but be aware that custom backplate cooling solutions may require an updated part.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That Gen 5 NVMe slot can also be cooled by the included M.2 heat sink fan, a nice touch since these drives can certainly get toasty.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DDR5 is also here, and if you can remove that stubborn sticker, it will give you some of the best performance we&rsquo;ve seen from DDR5. Going up to 6600MHz, you&rsquo;ll be able to choose one click &ldquo;Expo&rdquo; profiles in the BIOS.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Asrock X670E Taichi\" class=\"wp-image-1421944\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-11-18-at-3.12.37-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Asrock has had several BIOS updates so far, and hopefully the longer-than-normal boot times continue to improve. The sticker has some estimates on boot times after a clear CMOS, with worst-case scenario of four sticks (32GB) taking as long as 400 seconds! (That&rsquo;s almost 7 minutes for those keeping track!)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re running an RTX 40 series GPU from Nvidia, you should grab the newest BIOS updates as well, since they&rsquo;ve included various performance updates related to these graphics cards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The BIOS itself is easy to use, and as expected, is robust in tweaking options for overclockers and those seeking to fine-tune their rigs. Those who want a simple one-click approach also have this option. Asrock has a strong history with extreme overclockers, such as with its &ldquo;Formula&rdquo; line of motherboards, the DNA of which can be found in the Taichi. Rounding things out, power and reset buttons, as well as a debug screen are here for maximum control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asrock also offers various pieces of control software within Windows: Polychrome RGB for light functionality, Nahimic3 for audio, APP Shop for updates, and Asrock motherboard utility for other functions. Compared to the Asus Armoury Crate, Asrock&rsquo;s software is less integrated and could stand more polish.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"should-you-buy-the-asrock-x670e-taichi\">Should you buy the Asrock X670E Taichi?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Asrock X670E Taichi brings one of the best feature sets you&rsquo;ll find on any motherboard in the $499 range. With USB 4, plenty of NVMe slots, plus a premium presentation to the entire package, it&rsquo;s a winner.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, there are a few items we can nitpick: that tough-to-remove sticker, and that lack of M.2 quick release. (It&rsquo;d be a home run to have 10GbE included too!) We also don&rsquo;t like that the USB4 ports aren&rsquo;t clearly labeled? Is one of them Thunderbolt 4? The symbols are the same.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>BIOS updates are welcomed and vital, and we hope the board continues to improve and remain stable. (This is common of most X670E motherboards&mdash;with a new chipset updates and tweaks are expected.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the Taichi is one of the best premium motherboards you can find for X670E, especially considering the price. Both gamers and content creators will find plenty to like in this capable and richly appointed product.</p>\n\nDesktop PCs, Gaming PCs</div>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1421866/what-death-can-teach-you-about-digital-memories.html", "title": "What life and death taught me about digital memories", "date_published": "2022-12-06 11:00:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t a tech story. This is a life story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My mother, Kathleen Hachman, passed away at the end of October. Cancer. She fought it for about eight years, trying various treatments, but they eventually couldn&rsquo;t keep up with the disease that overcame her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She bought a wig, and fooled my two boys, her only grandchildren, into thinking that was her natural hair. She visited every weekend, including during the pandemic. We would play Uno with separate decks, across the yard, because we were all worried that she would catch covid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She chose to spend her last months at home, while my father, her husband of over 50 years, took care of her. This was the man who broke his shoulder and didn&rsquo;t want to go to the hospital because my mother was in chemotherapy at the time. Who had driven my little brother to chemo time and again, several years prior, before he succumbed to cancer, too. And who has cancer, himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe this isn&rsquo;t a life story. This is a memory story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was born before the internet, before smartphones, before the ubiquity of cameras and social apps and oversharing. My mother was born in an even earlier age, where photos were memories. She never volunteered to be in photos. I don&rsquo;t think she took a selfie in her entire life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank God for my kids. My mother adored my two boys, and devoted her life to them in the same way she devoted her life to the elementary and middle school kids she taught. If I took photos or videos of my kids, she was often in them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always intended to interview my mother and grandmother, asking them about their early lives, what it was like growing up, raising a (my) family, and so on. I feel like an absolute failure for never doing so. Instead, at least, I have photos and video of my mother and father with my kids&mdash;at birthday parties, soccer games, family stuff. Practically every vacation we took they came along, just to be there. My mother set a goal of living until my eldest son could enter high school, and she achieved that. Not by much, but she hit her deadline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to tell you is this: Use that phone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we&rsquo;re friends on Facebook, you know: I rarely post. I don&rsquo;t really care about sharing my social life or victories or whatever bull people share to be seen as successful and validated. I record memories, privately. Some visual trigger that will prompt me to recall a day, a time, and a feeling. But more and more, I find that photos aren&rsquo;t enough. Video matters far more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Record how your child laughs, or how your mother smiles and tells a joke. That&rsquo;s what will keep those memories alive. Tag that video&mdash;or use the facial recognition services that a service like Google Photos offers and archive it. Reach out to family and friends and ask what video recordings they have. Bring them together inside a shared online folder. Store them, for the days that you&rsquo;ll need them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your smartphone camera is now the primary way you will hold on to the memories of your family, friends, and loved ones. Video, which is also right at your fingertips, can be stored just as easily as more and more online storage becomes available. Back it up, either in the cloud or on an external hard drive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While your friends and family are still around, video them. Yes, it seems intrusive to me, too. But at a certain point you&rsquo;re going to have to tell the loved ones in your life that this is for <em>you</em>, not for them, and that it&rsquo;s going to be these memories that you turn to when they&rsquo;re gone. That this is the moment to have their voices echo through the days and weeks, and eventually years and even generations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I played baseball competitively, through college, and my mother would play catch. She would warm me up. For years (and why she did this, I don&rsquo;t know) she would put on a pair of gardening gloves instead of a baseball mitt, take me to the park across the street, squat down, and I would throw fastballs and breaking pitches to her. This was a woman who refused anesthetic at the dentist. She would power through it via force of will and her perpetual, unfailing optimism that she, and her family, could weather anything life threw at us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have no record of this, just my own, internal memory that will disappear once I&rsquo;ve gone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know some of you don&rsquo;t have the kind of relationship that I had with my mother&mdash;well, all of my family, to be honest. I&rsquo;m sorry for that. But if you do, remember that the holidays are coming up. Throw me under the bus; I don&rsquo;t care. Just tell them that you saw some dumb article on the internet, and you thought, <em>well, it&rsquo;s the holidays&mdash;can you just record a message that I can listen to during the rest of the year?</em> They don&rsquo;t even have to know the real reason you&rsquo;re asking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We believed that my mother had weeks or even months left. I worked from the early morning until after midnight on both the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357826/microsoft-surface-pro-9-5g-review-an-arm-tablet-worth-buying.html\">Surface Pro 9 review</a> as well as the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357810/microsoft-surface-laptop-5-review-for-surface-fans-only.html\">Surface Laptop 5 review</a>, straight through the weekend, just so I could finish up and then spend as much time with her as I could. She died shortly after, unexpectedly, and I had just one last day while she was aware of my presence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been told that no death is easy, that everyone dies with some sort of regrets. There are no tutorials for how to let a loved one finally pass on. But there are lessons to be learned, and to be passed along to those who have the time to learn them.</p>\n\nCloud Storage, Smartphones</div>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1426371/intel-next-gen-meteor-lake-chip-tech-is-ready-now.html", "title": "Intel\u2019s next-gen \u2018Meteor Lake\u2019 chip tech is ready now", "date_published": "2022-12-06 10:45:00+00:00", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel said Monday that the foundation of its next-generation processor, the Intel 4 process, is now &ldquo;manufacturing-ready today.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That process will be used to manufacture Intel&rsquo;s next chip, code-named Meteor Lake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ann Kelleher, general manager of technology development at Intel, released an updated manufacturing roadmap in conjunction with the 2022 IEEE Electron Device Meeting, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/whats-next-for-moores-law#toggle-gdpr&amp;xcust=2-1-1426371-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">published in IEEE Spectrum</a>. The roadmap itself looks similar, albeit with some fine-tuning of the roadmap. The news, however, is that Intel is on the cusp of launching what will probably be its 14th-gen Core chip, Meteor Lake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/615594/intel-updates-cpu-roadmap-emphasizing-low-power-cpus.html\">published its manufacturing roadmap for the next several years</a> beginning this past February. It began filling in the details in August and earlier, revealing the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/834401/intels-lunar-lake-will-be-a-specialized-low-power-pc-chip.html\">roadmap through 2024&rsquo;s Lunar Lake</a>. The key, however, is what Intel released Monday, that Intel 4, and likely Meteor Lake, is now ready for manufacturing.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel manufacturing roadmap, Dec. 2022\" class=\"wp-image-1426389\" height=\"721\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intel-roadmap-larger.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Intel&rsquo;s manufacturing roadmap as of Dec. 2022, as published in IEEE Spectrum.</figcaption></figure><a class=\"imageCredit\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/whats-next-for-moores-law#toggle-gdpr&amp;xcust=2-1-1426371-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Intel via IEEE Spectrum</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As Boyd Phelps, corporate vice president of Intel&rsquo;s design engineering group, and general manager of client engineering, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://corporate%20vice%20president%20of%20Intel%E2%80%99s%20design%20engineering%20group,%20and%20general%20manager%20of%20client%20engineering&amp;xcust=2-1-1426371-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">explained </a>in August, only the CPU tile of Meteor Lake will be built upon Intel&rsquo;s Intel 4 technology. The remainder of the tiles will be sourced from TSMC, using tiles manufactured on its N5 and N6 process. The various tiles will be <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/876620/intel-meteor-lake-ucie-interconnect-chips.html\">built using the UCIe interface</a>, a seemingly abstract concept that&rsquo;s remarkably approachable: Like a PC, various tiles will be &ldquo;plugged in&rdquo; to the UCIe interconnect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably the most significant improvement, however, will be the addition of specialized AI components. AI is a feature of the Qualcomm Snapdragon Arm chips, its legacy of smartphone AI enhancements including portrait mode, with artificial bokeh put in by AI. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September at the Intel Innovation conference, Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger talked a little about what he believed Meteor Lake&rsquo;s AI capabilities could accomplish. &ldquo;One of the things we will be bringing is what I would say is core AI capabilities,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1076150/intel-confirms-ai-improvements-will-come-in-meteor-lake.html\">he said then</a>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sitting on a Zoom or Teams [call]. Do I want to have simultaneous translation or contextualization of that call? Yes. Do I want to have cameras that are following the speaker and performing image enhancements? Yes.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July, details of Meteor Lake <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.igorslab.de/en/intel-meteor-lake-u-p-and-h-exclusive-block-diagram-of-mobile-14-generation-leak/&amp;xcust=2-1-1426371-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">leaked</a>, though the leaks said then that the chip was scheduled for the second half of 2023.

Igor&rsquo;s Lab claims to have seen roadmaps that show the chips having six performance and eight efficiency cores, with a new low-power E-core, too.
