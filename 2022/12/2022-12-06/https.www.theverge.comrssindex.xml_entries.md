  <p id="90DsGE">Chrome tab jockeys and bookmark hoarders, rejoice: you can now quickly swift through your whole browser mess with <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/search-your-tabs-bookmarks-and-history-in-the-chrome-address-bar/">a new simple “@” shortcut in the address bar</a>. Available on the latest Chrome version 108 for desktops, the feature will help simplify tasks like getting to that article tab you know you left open somewhere without needing to conduct another web search.</p>
<p id="XrjatU">If you’re like me, you might have a whole lot of troubleshooting articles saved as bookmarks, but when someone needs help with some specific problem, you just Google it again instead of looking for what you’ve saved. Now, you can type “@bookmarks” or just “@,” then hit the space bar and click “Search Bookmarks,” and start typing some key terms.</p>

Getting battery costs down, getting range up, and convincing car buyers to break up with gasoline for good are just some of the more commonly known ones.

  <p id="dWkWIj">Right now, there’s “unprecedented momentum behind renewables,” the International Energy Agency <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/renewable-power-s-growth-is-being-turbocharged-as-countries-seek-to-strengthen-energy-security">says</a>. Renewable power growth has been “turbocharged” by countries scrambling to tackle a global energy crisis spurred on by war in Ukraine, according to new analysis from the agency. Over just the next five years, as much renewable power is expected to come online globally as was added over the past two decades. </p>
<p id="KdpTyd">Renewables will make up a whopping 90 percent of electricity capacity expansion in that five-year span, according to a new <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2022&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1670345715111787&amp;usg=AOvVaw1htIfQKVtI52N42PacHMGS">report</a> by the International Energy Agency (IEA). By 2025, renewable energy is expected to topple coal to become the world’s biggest electricity source. </p>
<p id="22CDqC">Solar and wind power make up the vast majority of that...</p>

<p id="lBmztD">The videos in TikTok’s FYFaves list all have millions of views and are supposed to represent the most viral content on the app. The list is curated, though, and leaves out other videos with high views and engagement, so it isn’t a direct representation of the top-performing clips on the platform this year.</p>
<p id="QpMEKi">Still, the list offers some insight into what’s been successful on TikTok, and over the past three years, views on the No. 1 spot have been trending downward.</p>

Background vocals can appear independently of main vocals, according to Apple, and there will be a duet view as well if you want to sing along with a friend.

  <p id="t5k8Mp">One of Carrot Weather’s main selling points, besides the fact that it’s a genuinely very good app for getting the forecast, is its character. The app has an “AI” that will serve up scalding insults and timely jokes alongside the “feels like” temperature (the only measure that matters, don’t at me). The latest update is taking that experience to a whole new level: according to the app’s developer, Brian Mueller, you’ll be able to “improve your relationship with the homicidal AI” and even “start a ‘romance’ with her.”</p>
<p id="JKIBc3">You endear yourself to Carrot through “bonding activities,” which will increase the number of hearts you have with the app. Those include “debugging” the app (which involves shaking your phone), “charging its servers,” and...</p>

  <p id="RmXDki">Polestar is offering an over-the-air (OTA) software update that boosts the electric Polestar 2’s performance by 68 horsepower. And rather than lock it behind an annual paywall as other automakers have done, the Chinese-Swedish company says it will only charge a one-time fee of $1,195. </p>
<p id="0VcRZB">The upgrade adds 68 horsepower and 15 pound-feet of torque to the existing 408hp and 487 lb-ft of torque currently offered by the Polestar 2’s dual-motor powertrain, for a total output of 476hp and 502 lb-ft. Because the upgrade is software-based, the performance boost can be downloaded directly to the vehicle without needing to take it to a service center. The performance upgrade is only available to owners of the long-range dual-motor version of the...</p>

But in blog posts, both Ubisoft and Amazon are careful to say that this only applies to “select” titles, so it could be a limited batch to start.
