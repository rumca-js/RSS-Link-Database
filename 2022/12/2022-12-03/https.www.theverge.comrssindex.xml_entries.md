  <p id="gzz1AY"><em>Fortnite</em> just wrapped up its most recent large-scale live event, and it was a strange one — even by <em>Fortnite</em> standards. The event, dubbed “Fracture,” was meant as a sendoff for <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 3, and now that it’s over, the game is down ahead of the launch of the next chapter on December 4th, which will introduce not only a new island, but characters like the witcher himself, Geralt of Rivia.</p>
<p id="ouL2Rn">Before things kicked off, players were split into groups, hanging out on tiny floating islands with little to do but watch a countdown displayed on a TV screen. (My trio of players all sat around roasting marshmallows together.) That was followed by a cutscene in which The Herald, a relatively new <em>Fortnite</em> character, led an attack of tornadoes, and...</p>

  <p id="F3kX9N"><a href="https://youtu.be/uLtkt8BonwM">HBO’s official trailer for <em>The Last of Us</em></a> shows off the dynamic between Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) as the two traverse a post-apocalyptic US amidst the outbreak of a mutant fungus that turns humans into zombie-like beings. It offers a much more detailed look at the dangers the two come across <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23372992/the-last-of-us-trailer-hbo-watch">when compared to the previous teaser</a>, including a brief glimpse at the infected themselves.</p>
<p id="zvy1J6">Like the PlayStation game of the same name, the series has Joel escorting Ellie, who’s immune to the fungus, across the country in hopes of finding a cure for the outbreak. The trailer flashes between scenes of dialogues showcasing Storm Reid as Ellie’s friend Riley and Nick Offerman as Bill. At the end of the trailer, we see a swath of...</p>

  <p id="78jM4k">Netflix's first full trailer for <em>The Witcher: Blood Origin </em>shines a<em> </em>spotlight on the prequel’s key characters played by Michelle Yeoh, Sophia Brown, and Laurence O’Fuarain. But it also comes with a bit of a surprise at the very end, revealing the return of Joey Batey’s Jaskier.</p>
<p id="udeFOn">The bard’s return doesn’t make all that much sense yet, as the series takes place 1,200 years before <em>The Witcher</em>, but it might have something to do with the massive monoliths included in the trailer that are “causing tears between worlds.” Towards the end of the trailer, Jaskier’s lute appears, while Minnie Driver’s Seanchai, a character <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/minnie-driver-witcher-announcement">described by Netflix</a> as a “shapeshifting collector of old lore with the abilities to travel between time and worlds” asks a...</p>
