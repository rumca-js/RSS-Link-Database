It\u2019s not so much the unwieldy structure and the disconcerting tonal swerves between chapters that prove to be a problem, although it was never going to sit entirely elegantly as a screenplay. Mainly it\u2019s the fact that DeLillo\u2019s voice so dominates the storytelling. This isn\u2019t such a problem in a book, but in a film, with every character speaking in the same distinctively verbose verbal patterns, it feels more like a glorified ventriloquist act than a character-driven drama. There are tonal issues also. If a film could smirk, this one would.</p><p>Adam Driver stars as Jack Gladney, a provincial college professor whose area of expertise is \u201cHitler studies\u201d. His wife, Babette (Greta Gerwig), teaches exercise classes for pensioners and shares with her husband a profound fear of death. They tie themselves in knots debating who should die first, sounding like two sides of the same tiresomely neurotic internal monologue. Which is, of course, exactly what they are. The first of several story chapters is fairly uneventful; however, in the second, Jack\u2019s existential dread takes on a visible form, a looming \u201cairborne toxic event\u201d. In the third, Jack discovers that his wife\u2019s infidelity and her use of an unlisted experimental drug are linked. A closing-credits supermarket dance sequence is fresh and fun, but the rest of the picture is laboriously quirky and self-regarding.</p><p>In cinemas now/<a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81317320\">on Netflix from 30 December</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/03/white-noise-review-noah-baumbach-don-delillo-adaptation-adam-driver-greta-gerwig\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/03/axl-rose-guns-n-roses-promises-to-stop-throwing-mic-into-crowd-after-reports-a-fan-was-hurt", "title": "Axl Rose promises to stop throwing mic into crowd after reports a fan was hurt", "date_published": "2022-12-03 14:32:05+00:00", "description": "<p>The Guns N\u2019 Roses singer made the announcement on Twitter after the incident at in Adelaide, Australia</p><p>Axl Rose has promised to stop throwing his microphone into the audience after a fan was reportedly hurt during a recent show in Australia.</p><p>The Guns N\u2019 Roses singer, who celebrated his 60th birthday this year, has routinely ended their shows by offering attenders towards the front a chance to catch his mic.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/03/axl-rose-guns-n-roses-promises-to-stop-throwing-mic-into-crowd-after-reports-a-fan-was-hurt\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/03/pele-moved-to-end-of-life-care-in-hospital-reports-say", "title": "Pel\u00e9 moved to end-of-life care in hospital, reports say", "date_published": "2022-12-03 14:26:20+00:00", "description": "<p>Brazilian football legend is reportedly no longer responding to chemotherapy treatment</p><p>The Brazilian football legend Pel\u00e9 is receiving palliative care after chemotherapy treatment for colon cancer stopped having the expected results, it has been reported.</p><p>Pel\u00e9, 82, who is widely considered one of the greatest footballers of all time, was admitted to hospital on Tuesday to re-evaluate his cancer treatment and later diagnosed with a respiratory infection, according to medical reports.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/03/pele-moved-to-end-of-life-care-in-hospital-reports-say\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/03/nca-arrests-russian-businessman-in-london-suspected-of-money-laundering", "title": "NCA arrests Russian businessman in London suspected of money laundering", "date_published": "2022-12-03 14:05:47+00:00", "description": "<p>Officers from the Combating Kleptocracy Cell, which investigates potential criminal activity by oligarchs, were part of the operation</p><p>A wealthy Russian businessman has been arrested at his multimillion-pound London home by officers investigating potential criminal activity by oligarchs.</p><p>The 58-year-old man, who has not been named, was held by the National Crime Agency (NCA) on Thursday on suspicion of offences including money laundering, conspiracy to defraud the Home Office and conspiracy to commit perjury.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/03/nca-arrests-russian-businessman-in-london-suspected-of-money-laundering\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/03/facebook-revenge-porn-nude-images-culture-change", "title": "Facebook asked for nudes to help stop revenge porn and it worked.

Although not the most positive outlook on life, there is a kernel of truth in his wisdom.</p><p>Mo Gawdat, in his book Solve for Happy, discusses why people are happy or unhappy, content or dissatisfied, calm or frustrated in any given situation. He believes the primary factor is how we set our expectations in life, driven partly by the illusion of control against a backdrop of a universe whose natural state is \u201centropy and chaos\u201d. He states that \u201chappiness is equal or greater than the perception of the events of your life minus your expectations\u201d. In summary, whether \u201clife is going my way\u201d. Importantly he follows on: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter what life is, your happiness is defined by whether you are OK with it.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/dec/03/football-can-stop-the-hate-and-bring-joy-if-we-want-success-but-dont-expect-to-win\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/03/iliman-ndiayes-rise-from-sunday-league-to-senegal-world-cup-ace", "title": "Iliman Ndiaye\u2019s rise from Sunday league to Senegal World Cup ace", "date_published": "2022-12-03 07:30:38+00:00", "description": "<p>Sheffield United\u2019s rising star is preparing to face England in Qatar after a formative spell in the Northern Premier League</p><p>Iliman Ndiaye wanted to perfect his skills so much they had to turn off the lights at Hyde United\u2019s Ewen Fields to make sure he got the last train home.
