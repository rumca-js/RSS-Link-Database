To set the stage, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kevin-costner-yellowstone-quits\" target=\"_blank\">Governor John Dutton</a> entered the capitol and noticed about a dozen people having a meeting he didn't know about. It was his policy council discussing the policies the Governor supports.</p><p>Gov. Dutton decided that, if there was going to be a meeting about the policies he's supporting, he should be a part of it. Maybe even have some input. Since, you know, he's the governor and he's the one who was elected by the people.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">I finally found the clip from Sunday\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yellowstone?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Yellowstone</a> that beautifully illustrates the hypocrisy of some environmentalists.

They were then going to remove all Sage Brush -- that the Sage Grouse lives in -- to install solar panels.  Why? Alleged \"experts\" said there was no \"evidence\" that removing where the Sage Grouse lived was going to affect their population. This is something that made sense to the policy advisor.</p><p>Governor Dutton fired the entire committee.</p><p>\"Anti-woke\" doesn't have to mean jokes about pronouns or feminists. If can be something as simple as exposing the left's obsession with the bearucratic management class. Which in many ways, works AROUND the officials elected by the people. They do it when everyone's not looking.</p><p>Social issues, while also important, are sexier and better for clicks. But if more Americans were exposed to how things operate behind the scenes, we'll all be better off. Now we need a story line with John Dutton confronts a \"misinfomation tech reporter\" who does nothing but collect quotes from any alleged \"expert\" they agree with, calls it journalism, and acts like a dick about it on Twitter. </p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
