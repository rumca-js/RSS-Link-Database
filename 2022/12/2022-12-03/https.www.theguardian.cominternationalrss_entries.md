<p>England striker’s mindset is shaped by his previous tournament experiences and he has eyes only for the next opportunity</p><p>Harry Kane admits that he can dwell on the misses only not for long.

By the angled head of Mitchell Duke and the cut inside of Mat Leckie. By a free-kick for Messi near the corner flag. And it had to be him. History will show tonight was all about Messi.

## Beyond beliefs: does religious faith lead to a happier, healthier life?

<p>The stress-reducing, life-extending benefits of religion can offer useful strategies even for non-believers, say scientists</p><p>In his <em>Pensées, </em>published posthumously in 1670, the French philosopher Blaise Pascal appeared to establish a foolproof argument for religious commitment, which he saw as a kind of bet. If the existence of God was even minutely possible, he claimed, then the potential gain was so huge – an “eternity of life and happiness” – that taking the leap of faith was the mathematically rational choice.</p><p>Pascal’s wager implicitly assumes that religion has no benefits in the real world, but some sacrifices. But what if there were evidence that faith could also contribute to better wellbeing? Scientific studies suggest this is the case. Joining a church, synagogue or temple even appears to extend your lifespan.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/03/beyond-beliefs-religious-faith-happier-healthier-life">Continue reading...</a>

The rapper’s creations are unlikely to pass muster with adherents of modern design, even if they do ‘push the boundaries’<p>The news that the rapper A$AP Rocky is <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/asap-rocky-announced-his-new-home-decor-line-with-a-psychedelic-cactus" title="">launching a “decor studio”</a> will be startling to believers in the high-minded principles of modern design, and its antecedents in the arts and crafts movement, especially when they see that his main idea is to add some primary-coloured mushrooms to a cactus-shaped hatstand created 50 years ago by the Italian designers Guido Drocco and Franco Mello. “Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful,” said the Victorian socialist and designer William Morris, words that don’t have much traction in this case. “A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away,” said the author and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. Nope, also not much use here. Rocky’s explanation is that he has long advocated for psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in magic mushrooms, so “it was only right that we made a cactus with them”. This might sound like a flimsy argument to justify what looks like a marketing gimmick. But maybe legacy objections don’t apply when, as Rocky says of himself, you’re trying to “push the boundaries of the home decor space”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/03/asap-rockys-psilocybin-inspired-decor-studio-doesnt-leave-much-room-for-high-minded">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Jazz Cat)<br />In contemplative mood, the bassist showcases the rich talents of five fellow musicians – and his first writing for strings</p><p>Albums recorded, prepared or merely dreamed up in the days of lockdown are still appearing.

The tone is more subdued this time. The album’s 10 tracks suit the title well, most of them being musical impressions of people and places Crosland recalls and holds dear. There are only six musicians here, including Crosland on electric bass, but he always manages to get the best and to display their talents to advantage. The three soloists – Theo Travis (flute), Steve Waterman (trumpet) and Alan Barnes (clarinet) – all come up with some really gripping performances.</p><p>There’s no way of preparing for something like this, calling as it does for instant and sustained inventiveness.

<p>Noah Baumbach’s laboriously quirky adaptation of DeLillo’s 1985 book can’t break free of the author’s voice</p><p>Sometimes a book that seems uniquely ill-suited to a cinema adaptation turns out to make an unexpectedly daring and inventive movie. Sometimes an “unfilmable” book is just unfilmable. Don DeLillo’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/17/white-noise-is-an-outsider-small-town-life-don-delillo">White Noise</a></em>, adapted for the screen by Noah Baumbach, falls into the latter camp. It’s not so much the unwieldy structure and the disconcerting tonal swerves between chapters that prove to be a problem, although it was never going to sit entirely elegantly as a screenplay. Mainly it’s the fact that DeLillo’s voice so dominates the storytelling. This isn’t such a problem in a book, but in a film, with every character speaking in the same distinctively verbose verbal patterns, it feels more like a glorified ventriloquist act than a character-driven drama. There are tonal issues also. If a film could smirk, this one would.</p><p>Adam Driver stars as Jack Gladney, a provincial college professor whose area of expertise is “Hitler studies”. His wife, Babette (Greta Gerwig), teaches exercise classes for pensioners and shares with her husband a profound fear of death. They tie themselves in knots debating who should die first, sounding like two sides of the same tiresomely neurotic internal monologue. Which is, of course, exactly what they are. The first of several story chapters is fairly uneventful; however, in the second, Jack’s existential dread takes on a visible form, a looming “airborne toxic event”. In the third, Jack discovers that his wife’s infidelity and her use of an unlisted experimental drug are linked. A closing-credits supermarket dance sequence is fresh and fun, but the rest of the picture is laboriously quirky and self-regarding.</p><p>In cinemas now/<a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81317320">on Netflix from 30 December</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/03/white-noise-review-noah-baumbach-don-delillo-adaptation-adam-driver-greta-gerwig">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Susan Cooper’s 1973 novel, newly adapted for a BBC audio series, has enthralled generations of children and writers with its folkloric tale of an English boy caught in a battle between light and dark</p><p>I first read<em> </em>Susan Cooper’s <em>The Dark Is Rising</em> the summer I turned 13, the year the Berlin Wall came down. I read it by torchlight under the bedclothes, not because of parental curfew or power cut, but because that seemed the safest place to read what was, unmistakably, the eeriest novel I’d ever met.</p><p>Eeriness is different in kind to horror. Eeriness thrives in edge-of-the-eye glimpses; horror is full-frontal. The eerie lives in the same family of feelings as Freud’s “uncanny”, which in its original German, <em>unheimlich</em>, means “unhomely”. A core power of Cooper’s novel lies in its counterpointing of the homely and the unhomely. It opens in the domestic clamour of the Stanton family house, in a quiet English village in the upper Thames valley. It’s 20 December: the eve of both the winter solstice and the 11th birthday of Will, the youngest of the Stanton children. Inside the house, all is pre-Christmas chaos, baking smells and familiarity. But in the wintry landscape around, something is very wrong. Rooks are behaving strangely, dogs are suddenly afraid of Will, a blizzard is coming, and “a shadowy awareness of evil” is building. Will’s life is about to change for ever – for he will become caught up in an ancient battle between the forces of the Light and those of the Dark, which are always strongest at midwinter. His young shoulders are soon to bear an immense burden.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/03/midwinter-magic-robert-macfarlane-world-service-the-dark-is-rising-susan-cooper-bbc">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>O2 Arena, London</strong><br />Despite arriving late, and rumours of rifts behind the scenes, the South Korean superstars unleash their expertly blended mega hits with total commitment</p><p>K-pop prides itself on vertiginously high standards in all aspects of production, from its choreography to the carefully curated public images of its stars. So it’s surprising that the European leg of the biggest tour ever by an all-female K-pop act begins a tad late. A bemused American voice apologises for “technical difficulties” over the PA. (Blackpink’s world tour has transferred from a successful run in the US.) There’s little for “Blinks” – Blackpink fans – to do but watch the band’s videos and bash their <a href="https://black-pink.fandom.com/wiki/Bl-ping-bong">heart-hammer light sticks</a>, which produce a polite squeak, on the nearest hard surface.</p><p>When the assault on the senses finally begins, though, it is in earnest. Arena pop is known for its OTT staging and pyrotechnics. K-pop puts a rocket under all that. One of the drivers of the genre’s ubiquity in the past decade is the ability of the all-powerful South Korean production houses to cherrypick the most impactful aspects of western pop – trap beats, Swedish production signatures, anthemic pre-choruses, 1980s keyboard lines – and throw them in a blender, then sell them back to the world in enhanced forms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/03/blackpink-o2-arena-london-review-born-pink-k-pop-juggernaut-with-world-beating-attitude">Continue reading...</a>

It’s a blustery November afternoon and the last remaining greens outside are fading fast. But below ground, at the bottom of a short flight of stairs, the inside of this 80ft-long sleek structure is bursting with life – pallets of vivid microgreens, potato plants growing from hay bales and planters full of thick heads of Swiss chard and pak choi. Two<strong> </strong>people bend over the pallets, using scissors to harvest delicate sprouts of microgreens.</p><p>This is an underground greenhouse, or walipini, and the harvesters are members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe. It is one of at least eight underground greenhouses that, over the past decade, have been built or are being constructed on the reservation – which has one of the highest poverty rates in the US. Some hope they can help solve the interconnected problems of the lack of affordable, nutritious food and the difficulties of farming in the climate crisis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/03/south-dakota-reservation-food-desert-residents-transforming-crop-oasis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A camera, a lamp, a child’s tricycle … Photographer Gideon Mendel’s latest project highlights the everyday impact of the climate crisis</p><p>“I was looking for a way to respond to the climate crisis for a long time,” says Gideon Mendel. Since the 1980s, the South African photographer has dedicated his career to documenting social issues around the globe – from the atrocities of <a href="https://gideonmendel.com/the-struggle/" title="">apartheid</a> to the Syrian refugee crisis. His images have sought to centre the lives and voices of the people who have been affected. But when he turned his attention to the warming planet around 15 years ago, the standard visual language seemed to be all “glaciers and polar bears”. “I wanted to make my work more personal and visceral,” he says.</p><p>Now Mendel travels the world, visiting places where increased flooding and wildfires have destroyed homes and ravaged communities. He does not consider himself a photojournalist: you won’t find any dramatic scenes of fleeing or rescue in his portfolio. Rather, he sticks around to see what’s left behind. The Climate Artefact series, from his Burning World project, depicts personal possessions and other objects burnt in unplanned blazes. Mendel began collecting these charred mementoes after the intense bushfires in Australia in 2019–20; further items were acquired on subsequent trips to wildfire sites in Greece, Canada and the US.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/03/things-we-lost-wildfires-images-devastating-personal-cost-warming-world-gideon-mendel">Continue reading...</a>

Her parents are “amazingly excited” about meeting their first grandchild, not least because they funded Isobel’s fertility treatment – as is the case for an estimated <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1204330/Grandparents-funding-IVF-desperate-couples-borrow-thousands-fund-dreams-parenthood.html" title="">one in eight</a> British couples needing IVF – meaning she and her partner could throw everything into trying to conceive, undergoing several treatment cycles in quick succession.</p><p>“I’m so grateful to have been able to rattle through it at the speed we did, when I know friends have taken big gaps between IVF rounds because they had to save up,” says Isobel, who works for a London-based charity. “I didn’t have to think about how much it cost, which really took the pressure off.” The pandemic had also made her acutely aware of her parents’ mortality, worrying they might not live to see any grandchildren. So she and her partner gratefully accepted their offer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/dec/03/why-inheritance-is-the-dirty-secret-of-the-middle-classes-harder-to-talk-about-than-sex">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The New York subway provided the inspiration for this photo of a woman waiting on a platform</p><p>Chris Maliwat describes the New York subway as the first slot in a pinball machine. “Whenever I head down there, I know it’s going to be a mini adventure, like I’m about to be launched into the world,” he says. “I saw this woman waiting at Metropolitan Avenue/Grand Street station and wondered which world she was about to shoot out into. Are there people like her where she’s going? Is she headed to her tribe? I think so. Everyone finds their tribe in New York – that’s why people come here.”</p><p>He didn’t approach her but instead surreptitiously took her photo for his Instagram page<a href="https://www.instagram.com/subwaygram/?hl=en" title=""> Subwaygram</a>. “The subway is full of people on their phones and the ubiquity means mine disappears.

<p>Memories of growing up in a takeaway, eulogies to pressure cookers and snacks, and the best of Jamaican and Indian cuisine</p><p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/03/the-best-books-of-2022">The best books of 2022</a></p><p>There is nothing cautious about <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/aug/21/sardines-toast-pork-chop-apple-tarts-recipes-jeremy-lee-quo-vadis" title="">Cooking: Simply and Well, for One or Many</a></strong> (4th Estate) by Jeremy Lee. I kept wondering if the editorial brief was<em> more!</em> More stories, more illustrations, more wit, more advice, more recipes. The abundance feels contained, though, as does<strong> </strong>the gregarious, expert and tender writing, in an exquisitely well-crafted volume. This is the most complete collection of recipes: pies, soups, stews, salads, tarts, puddings and a dish of potato, butter and cabbage called Rumbledethumps. It is also a biography recounted through home and professional cooking; a meditation on ingredients and eating; and a celebration of food writers past and present. Lee notes that time spent in the kitchen is “something to cherish and celebrate”. This book is, too.</p><p>“I was the kid you saw running behind the counter,” says Angela Hui. Her memoir <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/16/chinese-food-takeaway-angela-hui-scalding-oil-racist-prank-calls" title="">Take Away: Stories from a Childhood Behind the Counter</a> </strong>(Trapeze) is an exhilarating delight even when it isn’t – for example, when she describes the racism that Chinese immigrants running a takeaway in the Welsh valleys inevitably faced. Her observations are clear-sighted, her writing full of humour and life, and nowhere more so than when recounting her shy then rebellious adolescence, the fiery takeaway kitchen and the complex dynamics of private family cooking. Egg fried rice, steamed eggs, shark fin soup; recipes not only end each chapter, they tell stories, too, of longing and belonging.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/03/the-best-food-books-of-2022">Continue reading...</a>

But this year has yielded a handful of autobiographies from famous types determined to mix things up. Richard E Grant’s vivacious and heartfelt <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/a-pocketful-of-happiness-9781398519473" title="">A Pocketful of Happiness</a></strong> (Gallery) recounts a year spent caring for his late wife, Joan Washington, who was diagnosed with lung cancer shortly before Christmas in 2020, and the “head-and-heart-exploding overwhelm” that followed.

These include her experience of becoming a mother, cutting off all her hair on a family holiday in France and the time her father sent her home to England from Barbados alone, aged 11, including a stopover at a Miami hotel, as punishment for being rude to his girlfriend (Driver got her revenge by buying up half the gift shop on her dad’s credit card). She also recalls the disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein bemoaning her lack of sex appeal, which she notes was rich from a man “whose shirts were always aggressively encrusted with egg/tuna fish/mayo”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/03/the-best-memoirs-and-biographies-of-2022">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I found relatively little choice for under £25, but was impressed with the quality of these handful of products</p><p>Retinol is peerless in its proven ability to reduce pore size, treat acne scars, smooth skin texture and soften fine lines. But what if you want all that bang for less of your buck? Given retinol’s popularity in recent years, I was surprised by how relatively little choice there is in the below-£25 market, but impressed with the quality nonetheless.</p><p>CeraVe has finally launched a retinol serum in the UK, and it’s worth the wait. It combines encapsulated retinol (better tolerated by irritable skins) with CeraVe’s signature blend of three ceramides to cushion the skin’s barrier, and niacinamide (which everyone should be incorporating into their routine by now, for myriad good reasons, not least its calming properties). <strong><a href="https://www.cerave.com/skincare/serums/resurfacing-retinol-serum" title="">CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum</a></strong> (£19) is what I’d call – with much love and respect – a “Fisher Price retinol”, as it makes things easier and more comfortable for newbies and the retinol-wary (I know there are still plenty of you).

<p>Halina Reijn’s barbed satire of 21st-century youth culture and a bold tale of sexual discovery from Lena Dunham join Gen Z gems Booksmart, Eighth Grade and more</p><p>If online trend reporting is to be believed – always a pretty big if, admittedly – generation Z is not big on watching movies, succumbing instead to the shorter, smaller-screen allure of TikTok and YouTube for their viewing pleasure. Perhaps that’s one reason why there doesn’t seem to be a definitive canon of teen films for the post-millennial generation – but then, Hollywood has often struggled with capturing contemporary youth when films tend to be made by their elders.</p><p>That disparity isn’t entirely fixed by two Gen Z-themed films out on VOD last week, though both – to this craggy old millennial’s mind, at least – have sharper teeth than many of their gawky peers.

He states that “happiness is equal or greater than the perception of the events of your life minus your expectations”. In summary, whether “life is going my way”.

<p>Football Dreams was ostensibly about players in developing countries but its story makes for remarkable reading now</p><p>Look who we are, we are the dreamers. We make it happen. There is something seductively inane about the soundtrack to Qatar 2022, present in the slogans plastered across its surfaces, the sonic assault of the World Cup PA, the playlist of official anthems, centralised messages, approved corporate machine-feelings.</p><p>“Believing is magic” read the words across the back of the T-shirts worn by a column of men filing through the service exit of the vast fibreglass tent that is Al Bayt Stadium in the wee hours of Friday morning.

<p>A snowy cross-country walking break is even more beautiful – and fun – when you combine the hiking with tobogganing</p><p>I have invented a new sport, one that will almost certainly catch on and become a Winter Olympics classic. And it is one in which Team GB can narrowly grab fourth place, over and over again. It is wonderful to leave something behind, a legacy that will benefit humanity. It is called “bogganeering”.</p><p>It begins with a trip to Italy, the German-speaking part. That is an important factor. Südtirol has not always been an enthusiastic member of the Italian republic. Tucked up in the extreme north-east of the country, its snow-capped mountains are dotted with farms where the old men still wear Tirolean hats and greet strangers with a cheery “<em>Servus</em>!”, like Bavarians do. This is hybrid country par excellence, a rugged amalgamation of the best of northern and southern Europe, the perfect place to blend, meld and weld.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/dec/03/south-tirol-italy-hiking-with-tobogganing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From 90s singer to celebrated actor then film director – the I Hate Suzie star opens up about the highs and lows of growing up in public</p><p>“Hang on, I’ll just lock the door,” says Billie Piper. She is looking a bit goth, with black hair and black nails, though her neck is wrapped in a delicate scarf; she has not quite shaken the remnants of the definitely-not-Covid flu she’s had for the last few days. “I find it so weird doing interviews in front of people,” she says. “It’s so cringe. I guess if you can completely emotionally disconnect from people around you, then it’s fine, but I just find it very tricky. Anyway. So we’re in the bathroom. Hahaha.”</p><p>Piper is now 40, and has been in the public eye since she was 15. First, she was a pop star, and is still the youngest person to debut at No 1, with her 1998 earworm Because We Want To. Then, in 2003, she became an actor, winning plaudits in Doctor Who as the Doctor’s companion Rose Tyler. Throughout, she has been a fixture of the tabloids, her two marriages followed with gruesome interest, her ups and downs tracked through a paparazzo lens.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/03/billie-piper-interview-i-hate-suzie">Continue reading...</a>

On 15 July 2008, Cindy Anthony, Casey’s mother, called 911 to report her granddaughter missing for 31 days and that the trunk of Casey’s Pontiac Sunfire smelled like a dead body. If there were such a game as Karen Bingo, Casey would have covered the whole card. She misled investigators, pointed the finger at a made-up Afro-Latina nanny and showed more concern for her own self-preservation than for recovering her daughter. Finally, in October, Casey was charged with first-degree murder. Two months later Caylee’s skeletal remains were discovered, blanketed, inside a laundry bag in a wooded area near the Anthony family’s Orlando home. The autopsy further noted the presence of duct tape at the front of Caylee’s skull and on the mouth – grounds enough to pronounce the death a homicide.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/03/casey-anthony-docuseries-peacock">Continue reading...</a>

Throw in the garish but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/20/nasl-history-soccer-america">fondly remembered NASL</a>, an all-senses assault which attracted nearly as many superstars as Studio 54, and that’s a sizeable legacy.

World Cup qualifiers had resumed after a lengthy Covid-enforced hiatus, but Australia’s strict border restrictions made it next to impossible to host home games. Opponents were not willing to complete the 14 days of hotel quarantine. Neither were some of his own overseas-based players, and even those who were faced resistance from their clubs.</p><p>So Arnold left home bound for various parts of Asia, navigating a labyrinth of fixtures across the world’s largest continent when few international flights were running and border restrictions varied. The 59-year-old stayed in Dubai for some locked-down periods, and regularly oversaw matches on the back of only one full training session with a squad that was regularly changing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/03/graham-arnold-relishing-success-of-australias-platinum-generation">Continue reading...</a>
