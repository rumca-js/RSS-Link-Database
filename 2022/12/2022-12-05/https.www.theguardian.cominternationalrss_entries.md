And there were times when watching Brazil’s symphonic demolition of South Korea when it was briefly possible to leave behind earthly cares, partake of the simpler pleasures in life, lose oneself in the pure, riotous joy of football.</p><p>Brazil really were that good. For the first 40 minutes, as they waltzed and wove their way to a four‑goal lead, they played the sort of football we have not seen from them for many years: special-effects football, computer-game football, football so filthily good you needed a cigarette and a shower after watching it. For 40 minutes Neymar and Richarlison and Raphinha and Vinícius Júnior and Lucas Paquetá blazed little triangles, quadrilaterals, shapes that didn’t have a name yet, shapes embroidered and gilded with wicked flicks and outrageous stepovers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/05/brazil-south-korea-world-cup-last-16-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

It is an observation, not a slight: no other top international side lacks pace to such a marked degree but they invariably contrive to make sure it does not matter. That takes a preternatural collective knowhow, an assuredness that the first yard or two are in the head, a confidence that nobody should be putting in more miles than the ball itself. With it comes a pronounced lack of fear about the prospect of taking things the full distance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/dec/05/croatia-showed-once-again-that-they-are-the-masters-of-walking-football">Continue reading...</a>

Lowndes is where the college kids who made up the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (Sncc, pronounced snick) went to support the local community and help create the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO). Their focus was to get Black people elected into positions of power and effect change.

<p>We look at the strengths, weaknesses, danger men and tactics of England’s next opponents in Qatar</p><p>England will face France in a World Cup on Saturday for the first time since 1982, when they prevailed 3-1 in the first group stage.

France have won five of the past eight encounters, England coming out on top once. </p><p>The match at Al Bayt Stadium offers a huge opportunity to improve that run: Didier Deschamps’s world champions are in free-scoring form but have been ravaged by injuries and are unbalanced in some areas.

<p>The Tory chairman’s desperate remarks show the government has run out of arguments for pay restraint. No wonder its winter of discontent has turned into a winter of fury</p><p>I have my doubts that Vladimir Putin cares very much about the pay disputes of British nurses. He is probably the richest man in the world, and you don’t get there by taking a granular interest in other people’s living standards. He likely has very little concept of the difference between £31,000 a year and £310,000. Besides, he has his own problems.</p><p>Nevertheless, I can see how Nadhim Zahawi ended up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/04/striking-uk-workers-playing-into-putins-hands-says-zahawi">telling nurses that they were playing into Putin’s hands</a> with their demand for a pay rise, because Zahawi is out of road. He cannot reasonably tell them they don’t deserve more money: the average public sector worker has <a href="https://www.unison.org.uk/news/article/2020/12/reality-check-public-sector-pay-freeze/">earned less in terms of gross pay</a> than private sector workers every year since 2014. Nurses toughed out the pandemic on non-fungible claps, and emerge from it into a cost of living crisis. All the usual arguments for pay restraint – you don’t deserve it, we can’t afford it, do your worst, there are plenty more where you came from – have evaporated, leaving only: “Do your patriotic duty, because of the bad man.” Granted, he may have phrased it with more aplomb.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/05/strikes-help-putin-what-a-terrible-excuse-for-refusing-nurses-the-rise-they-deserve">Continue reading...</a>

Since 2016, the streaming giant has generated end-of-year listening statistics that claim to reveal users’ most intimate music secrets. Endless discourse about most-played songs, guilty pleasures and expected genres ensues. It’s a savvy marketing scheme for a platform that otherwise makes headlines for paying musicians poorly, although it seems few of us can resist the opportunity to show off our exemplary choices. But what can this data really tell us about our music tastes?</p><p>“Humans are good at trying to find reflections of ourselves in anything,” says anthropologist Nick Seaver. The author of a new book called Computing Taste, he argues that it’s important for us to understand “how that mirror got made, and what kinds of distortion is going into that reflection … It’s not just showing you as you are. It’s shaped by all sorts of decisions that people who are not you are making.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/05/has-spotify-really-wrapped-up-the-mystery-of-musical-taste">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the first edition of our new TV newsletter: Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain’s drama strikes a chord.

The audience laughs and cheers him on. Moments earlier, Jones’s team has been forced to slice through the hinges of a toilet door to pick up the incoherent singer, taping his knees straight so that he couldn’t fall down before marching him to that stage. But, once he’s there, he slots right into his king of country role, powder blue suit sparkin’ under the spotlights.</p><p>This is the opening scene of George &amp; Tammy (available now via Paramount+ in the UK and Showtime in the US), the latest show to mine country music for its low-down dirty dogs, fabulous costumes and high drama. This one is a starry miniseries/biopic that tells the story of Jones, also known as Possum (for his marsupial features, though I can never hear that word in a voice that doesn’t belong to Dame Edna Everage) and his eight-year marriage to one Tammy Wynette, the most tragic of all the female country stars. Michael Shannon plays Jones as a man tortured by drink and self-doubt, while Jessica Chastain – who, after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/sep/12/the-eyes-of-tammy-faye-review-jessica-chastain">The Eyes of Tammy Faye</a>, must have it in her contract that she plays a person named Tammy at least once a year – tackles the last three decades of Wynette’s complicated life. It’s a bit Star Is Born, a bit Walk the Line, and while it isn’t quite a No 1 hit, it deserves to be in the top 10 for at least a little while.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/05/george-and-tammy-country-music-whats-on">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It is time for this institution to be replaced by a council of the people, but Starmer may not have the stomach for reform</p><p>The most telling fact about the House of Lords is that not one living prime minister has deigned to darken its door. They know too much of its deals, kickbacks and cronyism to be reminded of them round every corner. Yes, there are impressive peers, but they are captives of a roughly 800-member club that has become the laughing stock of British democracy.

<p>The fight to stop Sheffield council’s controversial tree felling programme is told in this one-sided but determined activist documentary</p><p>Something must have gone seriously wrong inside Sheffield council. What on earth possessed them to give the OK to chopping down up to 17,500 roadside trees in the city, then go after locals who peacefully protested? The battle to stop Sheffield’s controversial tree felling programme is told in this blood-boiling documentary, assembled from footage shot by local photographer Jacqui Bellamy. It’s entirely one-sided, told from the perspective of Team Trees. Though frankly, it’s hard to imagine what the council or its private contractor Amey could come up with to defend some of their actions.</p><p>There’s a quick explainer at the start: the tree felling programme was part of a PFI contract worth £2.2bn between Sheffield council and Amey to upgrade the city’s roads. The film opens in 2016 in the aftermath of a dawn raid on mature limes in Rustlings Road. Tree surgeons arrived in the night to cut the trees, police hammering on doors at 5am to get people up to move their cars.

He highlighted the decentralisation plans – which make for a less exciting story than the defenestration of the nation’s peers, but arguably could be more important.</p><p>Summing up the report in the overnight Labour press release, Starmer said:</p><p>The centre hasn’t delivered. We have an unbalanced economy which makes too little use of the talents of too few people in too few places. We will have higher standards in public life, a wider spread of power and opportunity, and better economic growth that benefits everyone, wherever they are. By setting our sights higher, wider, better, we can build a better future together.</p><p>Among the report’s 40 recommendations is the need to give local communities new powers over skills, transport, planning and culture to drive growth. Delivering greater powers, combined with local growth plans, will enable the emergence of hundreds of ‘clusters’ of economic activity in cities and towns across all regions and nations of the United Kingdom. The co-ordination of activity across these clusters, by the people who know the assets of these areas best, will bring together local leadership, businesses, innovators, skilled workers, unions and entrepreneurs, that can drive a ‘new pro-growth strategy and make every part of our country more prosperous’ created economic activity that is more than the sum of its parts …</p><p>To make this happen the commission proposes real economic empowerment for our devolved government, the mayors, and local authorities, including:</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/dec/05/keir-starmer-rishi-sunak-labour-conservatives-brexit-latest-updates">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The premise of a high-school tutor forced to choose which of his students to marry could have been disastrous but this romantic fantasy film avoids ickiness</p><p>You fear the worst when you discover that this is an anime about a high-school tutor forced to choose which of his five quintuplet students to marry; will it be something flagrantly oblivious to recent #MeToo advances? But Masato Jinbo’s film is actually a fairly charming, if stridently sentimental and moralistic romantic fantasy that, with its clever structure, even manages to pick at the mysteries of identity.</p><p>The story is the culmination of the Quintessential Quintuplets TV series, an adaptation of the 2017-2020 manga of the same title. One mitigating factor is that Uesugi (voiced by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka) is approximately the same age as the five sapphire-eyed quins he is chaperoning as the end of the school year approaches. Everyone is looking ahead to their plans for the future, but there is the annual school festival to get out of the way first. The five siblings are equally moony over their tutor, and gathering them together, he admits he has feelings for them, too. But he promises to choose one by the time the three-day festivities are done.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/05/the-quintessential-quintuplets-review-sisters-compete-for-love-in-charming-anime">Continue reading...</a>

If not, you’re in for a long wait to be seen – or, on the worst days, a frustrated return home with no help or answers.</p><p>But the crisis is not just one of resources, it is also one of culture. Our struggling institutions have also succumbed to a steep fall in internal standards that is directly linked to their failure to deliver. Reports, anecdotal and, more recently, official, tell of bullying, corruption and a lack of accountability. Take the NHS, for instance. The institution symbolises the symbiosis between bad resourcing and bad culture. Vacant jobs at NHS England stand at a staggering <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/sep/01/nhs-vacancies-in-england-at-staggering-new-high-as-almost-10-of-posts-empty">10% of the workforce</a>. Some of that is down to familiar <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/oct/09/nursing-crisis-sweeps-wards-as-nhs-battles-to-find-recruits">funding issues</a>; unattractive pay, slashed subsidies for expensive nursing training, a limited number of university places to study medicine.

## Cleaning cuts and chilly stores: the secret diary of a Tesco manager

<p>The view from the shop floor as the UK’s biggest supermarket tries to protect profits while keeping prices down</p><p>Supermarkets <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/02/john-lewis-and-waitrose-to-dim-lights-and-cut-temperatures-to-save-energy">are cutting costs</a> as they try to protect profits while keeping prices down for customers. Top executives talk about “efficiencies”, but retail workers say that in practice that can mean chilly stores, cutbacks on cleaning and reductions in staff hours on spurious grounds.</p><p>The UK’s biggest supermarket, Tesco, for example, has handed out high-profile <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/05/tesco-warns-of-cost-inflation-as-it-raises-pay-for-third-time-in-13-months">hourly pay increases</a> for shop workers, but is cutting back the number of hours they can work, according to some staff. Meanwhile, the lowest-paid salaried staff such as team managers say they are having to do more while enduring a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/10/tesco-workers-real-terms-pay-cut">real-terms pay cut</a>, with rises of just 3% falling well short of the current <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/16/uk-inflation-rate-energy-price-rises">11.1% inflation rate</a>.</p><p>I am terrified about what Christmas might look like in Tesco given the amount of hours we are provided with to run our stores. We cut, cut, cut on the pretext of our strategic aim to “save to invest”, but the reality is the cuts destroy shops and management don’t reinvest in anything.</p><p>Cleaning is one area that is a constant focus for cuts. Every single year we get fewer and fewer hours for cleaning. Our contract cleaning is done by third parties such as Mitie and Servest, who bid every couple of years for contracts, but what they effectively sign up to is incredibly hard to achieve on the money that Tesco gives them.</p><p>One other area being tested out is turning store temperatures down by 1C. This is apparently to help the planet. There is widespread scepticism; it actually will save a huge amount of money. Tesco staff always complain quite rightly that our shops are too cold in the winter months, but it’s never addressed and colleagues end up having to wrap up in many layers to keep warm. They also have lower set temperatures for staff at night.</p><p>Recently, Tesco cut about 20 hours from some large stores for “service in the warehouse”, which it was claimed had been wrongly given to stores. The reality is that stores are run so incredibly tight and are under so much pressure, they certainly don’t have the capacity to remove them! It’s just snatching back money as always, putting more and more pressure on Tesco staff.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/05/cleaning-cuts-chilly-stores-secret-diary-tesco-manager">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Vladimir Putin is now ‘better informed’ about the difficulties his forces face, US intelligence chief says; US expects ‘reduced tempo’ in fighting over winter </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">See all our Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>Vladimir Putin is now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/04/vladimir-putin-better-informed-now-about-ukraine-war-says-us">“better informed” about the difficulties facing his forces </a>in Ukraine</strong>, the head of US intelligence has said. Speaking during a defence forum at the weekend, Avril Haines, the US director of national intelligence, indicated the Russian president was no longer as insulated from bad news arising from his invasion of Ukraine. Alluding to past assessments that Putin’s advisers could be shielding him, Haines said he was “becoming more informed of the challenges that the military faces”.</p><p><strong>The US expects a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2022/dec/04/us-expects-reduced-tempo-in-ukraine-conflict-to-continue-says-top-intelligence-official-video">“reduced tempo” in fighting</a> to continue over the winter months, </strong>adding that there could be brighter prospects for Ukrainian forces in the coming months. “Most of the fighting right now around Bakhmut and the Donetsk area has slowed down with the withdrawal of Russia from the western Kherson area to the east of the river. And we expect that’s likely to be what we see in the coming months,” Haines said.</p><p><strong>Heavy fighting continues around the key Donbas town of Bakhmut</strong>, where Russian forces have been struggling for six months to make minimal progress. Reports on social media suggested Ukrainian forces were making progress in operations on the east bank of the Dnipro River, opposite the recently liberated city of Kherson, after a reported amphibious landing on the Kinburn Spit last month. Russian forces have also intensified artillery attacks on the Kherson region since withdrawing from the western bank of the Dnipro.</p><p><strong>A draft resolution is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/dec/04/russian-war-crimes-draft-resolution-circulated-un-ukraine-zelenskiy">circulating at the United Nations</a> for a Nuremberg-style tribunal to hold Russia accountable for crimes of aggression in Ukraine</strong>. Signs also indicate that US opposition to the proposal may be softening in the face of lobbying by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Beth Van Schaack, the US ambassador for global criminal justice, said this week: “So far, all of the [UN general assembly] resolutions on Ukraine have prevailed. The numbers have been quite strong.” The international criminal court has already started investigating war crimes in Ukraine but cannot prosecute the Kremlin leadership over the broader crime of aggression since Russia is not a signatory to the relevant statute.</p><p><strong>Iran’s leadership has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/04/iran-locked-into-vicious-cycle-over-protests-and-arming-russia-says-us">locked itself into a “vicious cycle”</a> over protests and arming Russia</strong>, the US special envoy has said. “The more Iran represses, the more there will be sanctions; the more there are sanctions, the more Iran feels isolated,” Rob Malley, the US special envoy on Iran, told a conference in Rome. “The more isolated they feel, the more they turn to Russia; the more they turn to Russia, the more sanctions there will be, the more the climate deteriorates, the less likely there will be nuclear diplomacy. So it is true right now the vicious cycles are all self-reinforcing.” US intelligence chief Avril Haines said there was worrying evidence that Russia was seeking to deepen military cooperation with Iran.</p><p><strong>Russia will not sell oil that is subject to a western price-cap even if it has to cut production</strong>, Russian deputy prime minister Alexander Novak said on Sunday. The G7 and Australia agreed to the price cap on Friday.</p><p><strong>Opec+ agreed to stick to its oil output targets at a meeting on Sunday.</strong> Opec+, which comprises the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and allies including Russia, angered the US and other western nations in October when it agreed to cut output by 2m barrels a day, about 2% of world demand, from November until the end of 2023.</p><p><strong>More than 500 Ukrainian localities remained without power on Sunday</strong> following weeks of Russian airstrikes on the electric grid, an interior ministry official said.</p><p><strong>Ukraine is imposing sanctions on 10 senior clerics linked to a pro-Moscow church</strong> on the grounds they agreed to work with Russian occupation authorities or justified Moscow’s invasion, the security service said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/05/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-285-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
