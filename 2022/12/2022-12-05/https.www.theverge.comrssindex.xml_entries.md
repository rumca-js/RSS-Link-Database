  <p id="CYe4P1">After shifting iPhone production away from China, it now looks as if Apple’s got its eye on iPad production. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/05/apple-explores-moving-some-ipad-production-to-india.html">According to CNBC</a>, Apple is discussing producing some of its iPads in India to help diversify its supply chain.</p>
<p id="gSoAXJ">The news comes almost two years after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252434/apple-manufacturing-china-vietnam-ipad-india-iphone">reports emerged</a> that Apple is considering manufacturing iPads in Vietnam, too. Apple is doing this as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18691132/apple-china-manufacturing-diversify-india-vietnam-trade-war-tariffs">the company looks to move up to 30 percent</a> of its manufacturing outside of China.</p>
<p id="rghK2c">Apple’s been trying to diversify its manufacturing for years amid trade wars between China and the US and rising labor costs in China. More recently, strict covid restrictions sparked <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/24/23476593/foxconn-apple-factory-protest-apology-settlement">countrywide protests</a> that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/06/apple-warns-covid-restrictions-in-china-are-hurting-iphone-production-.html">last month</a> forced Apple to cut down the production of iPhone 14s there, leading to shipping...</p>

  <p id="PneDBp">Reliable leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks">OnLeaks</a> is offering what’s likely an early look at the upcoming OnePlus 11, with an updated camera bump treatment and the beloved alert slider intact. The image, <a href="https://gadgetgang.com/oneplus-11-images-and-specifications/">courtesy of <em>GadgetGang.com</em></a><em>,</em> shows a sleek round camera bump, green and black color options, and the alert slider alive and well on the device’s side rail above the power button. It also corroborates <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-11-pro-renders-leak/">an earlier leak</a>. All told, it looks like the 11 will represent a slight cosmetic update to the 10 Pro’s design — a welcome sight to OnePlus fans who feared that the slider was on its way out when it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/24/23273890/oneplus-10t-design-alert-slider-display-size-camera-specs">omitted from the 10T</a>. </p>

<p id="blzHhY">The terms of the data caps otherwise seem to be the same. As part of Starlink’s new “Fair Use Policy,” customers will have a dedicated amount of “Priority Access” data every month.
