This is a staggering amount of money, and it has raised concerns about the potential risks to the global financial system.<p>According to the BIS, these FX swaps are being used as a way to avoid regulatory scrutiny and to mask the true level of leverage in the financial system. The BIS has called on regulators to take action to address this issue and to ensure that non-bank financial firms are held to the same standards as banks when it comes to disclosing their true level of leverage.<p>The $80 trillion of off-balance sheet dollar debt held by pension funds and other non-bank financial firms represents a significant portion of the global economy. This has raised concerns that a potential financial crisis could have far-reaching consequences, not just for the financial sector but for the global economy as a whole.<p>The BIS has urged regulators to take action to address this issue, and has called on pension funds and other non-bank financial firms to be more transparent about their use of FX swaps and other forms of off-balance sheet debt. The BIS has also warned that failure to address this issue could result in serious consequences for the global financial system.<p>The UK government has yet to comment on this warning from the BIS, but it is expected that they will take the issue seriously and will work with regulators and the financial industry to address this potential risk to the global economy.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33867565\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33867565</a></p>\n<p>Points: 35</p>\n<p># Comments: 16</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://lawstreetmedia.com/news/health/cvs-sued-over-fraudulent-donations-to-american-diabetes-association/", "title": "CVS Sued over \u2018Fraudulent\u2019 Donations to American Diabetes Association", "date_published": "2022-12-05 15:56:41+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/news/health/cvs-sued-over-fraudulent-donations-to-american-diabetes-association/\">https://lawstreetmedia.com/news/health/cvs-sued-over-fraudulent-donations-to-american-diabetes-association/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33867266\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33867266</a></p>\n<p>Points: 63</p>\n<p># Comments: 24</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7b9en/chesscom-says-hans-niemanns-dollar100m-lawsuit-is-a-public-relations-stunt-in-motion-to-dismiss", "title": "Chess.com Says Hans Niemann\u2019s $100M Lawsuit Is a \u2018Public Relations Stunt\u2019", "date_published": "2022-12-05 15:46:28+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7b9en/chesscom-says-hans-niemanns-dollar100m-lawsuit-is-a-public-relations-stunt-in-motion-to-dismiss\">https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7b9en/chesscom-says-hans-niemanns-dollar100m-lawsuit-is-a-public-relations-stunt-in-motion-to-dismiss</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33867118\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33867118</a></p>\n<p>Points: 18</p>\n<p># Comments: 29</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://stratechery.com/2022/ai-homework/", "title": "AI Homework", "date_published": "2022-12-05 15:41:28+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/ai-homework/\">https://stratechery.com/2022/ai-homework/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33867039\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33867039</a></p>\n<p>Points: 67</p>\n<p># Comments: 34</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33866466", "title": "Ask HN: Image attribution and stable diffusion", "date_published": "2022-12-05 15:00:45+00:00", "description": "<p>There are websites that offer free images but either require attribution of the source of the image or else require paying a premium membership or subscription.<p>Presumably these companies are scraping public websites to check if their images are being used without attribution.<p>If someone was to take the image and run it through stable diffusion to generate a new image but using that image as a source, should this also require attribution if it was just used as a starting point?<p>I'm sincerely curious on peoples thoughts from both an ethical AND legal perspective (with all the usual disclaimers)<p>For example, one perspective is that the generated image may not resemble the original image but in a sense was used to get to that point, similar to how an artist may see a copyrighted image and decide on a creative spin on that image.<p>A further perspective is that stablediffusion may have been trained on copyrighted images in the first place even though it may not exactly reproduce an image in it's training corpus.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33866466\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33866466</a></p>\n<p>Points: 13</p>\n<p># Comments: 8</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33866463", "title": "Ask HN: Event Driven Design/Discovery?", "date_published": "2022-12-05 15:00:31+00:00", "description": "<p>Hi all<p>I remember finding (and subsequently losing the link to) a website a few months ago which outlined a process for requirements gathering and description based around an initiating event and the data transformations that should take place in response to it.

Clearly, <i>clearly</i>, that's a long way from building MVP products, designing new programming languages or writing \"Hello World\" in Haskell. But it's also a long way since even GPT-3, never mind status quo 10 years ago. It would be cool to discuss what a future looks like where \"human operators\" of programming are competing against a machine. I don't think it is imminent, but equally I think it's less imminent than I did a week ago.<p>Some threads that come to mind:<p>- Are these language models better than current offshore outsourced coders? These can code too, sort of, and yet they don't threaten the software industry (much).<p>- What would SEs do if any layperson can say \"hey AI slave, write me a program that...\"? What would we, literally, do? Are there other, undersaturated professions we'd go into, where analytical thinking is required? Could we, ironically, wake up in a future where thinking skills are taken over by machine, and it's other skills - visual, physical labour, fine motor skills - that remain unautomated?<p>- Are we even the first ones in the firing line? Clearly, for now AI progress is mostly in text-based professions; we haven't seen a GPT equivalent for video comprehension, for example. Are lawyers at risk? Writers?<p>- What can SEs do, realistically, to protect themselves? Putting the genie back in the bottle is not, as discussed many times in other threads, an option.<p>- Or is it all bogus (with justification), and we're fine?<p>No doubt ChatGPT will chip
