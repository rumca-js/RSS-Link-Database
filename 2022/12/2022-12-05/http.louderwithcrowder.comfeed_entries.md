And while not specified on the website, I'm guessing it's "or else."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11491943/Lawmakers-cry-against-Biden-IRS-reporting-requirements-600-transactions.html" target="_blank">Daily Mail</a> reports the threshold for 1099-K forms would be lowered from $20,000 to $600. Also, the number of transactions that trigger receiving a form will also be lowered from two hundred transactions... to one transaction. So for every transaction over $600, apps like Venmo and PayPal will report it directly to the government.</p><p>The changes were made when Biden signed The American Rescue Plan. AKA, the stimulus bill. Did your elected official vote for it? If they're a Democrat, yes.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>By now you're saying to yourself, <em>"But Brodigan, I'm not a millionaire or a billionaire. I was told that Biden looking to increase taxes on the middle class was misinformation. What the deuce?"</em></p><p>Two things. One, LOL... you said "butt Brodigan." B, I'm not a journalist or an expert. I'm not qualified to tell you what is or isn't misinformation. However, there are some things I find interesting you might find of interest yourself.</p><p>- Democrats snuck lowering the threshold to $600 in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. Critics called the bill "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dan-crenshaw-stimulus-bribe" target="_blank">bribing us with our own money.</a>" If you opposed this part of the Biden agenda, you were told you didn't want to help taxpayers by sending them stimulus checks.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="6668b" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32215228&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>- Funding for 87,000 new IRS employees was snuck into the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/irs-going-for-middle-class" target="_blank">Inflation Reduction Act</a>. If you opposed this part of the Democrat agenda you were told you didn't want to reduce inflation.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="6230b" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32215229&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>- PayPal, which is willing to work with the Administration, tried sneaking in a penalty that <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/paypal-terms-changed" target="_blank">they will take up to $2500 out of your account over what they call "misinformation."</a> Whether what they call "misinformation" is the same as what the Administration defines as "misinformation" is unclear. But I know that you know that I know that you know.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="aad32" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32215230&amp;width=980" />

## Watch: Apparently not dating a transperson because you want to have kids makes YOU the problematic one

Now depending on your choice, you could be -phobic. If you prefer your partner to be of a certain BMI, for example, you're fatphobic. Another popular one is that if you are a dude and don't want to date someone who used to be a dude, you are what critics call "transphobic." Critics like this TikToker, who claim having preferences is based on something bad.</p><p>That includes your preference to want to have children. And I really wish <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/wanting-biological-children-is-transphobic" target="_blank">this was not the first time this has come up</a>.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Not wanting to date a trans person is transphobic even if it’s because you want biological kids <a href="https://t.co/8qJvBkjOrj">pic.twitter.com/8qJvBkjOrj</a><br />— Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) <a href="https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1599496443433099264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>[This person] said something about trans women not being able to "carry" children. If that's your sole reason for dating someone, kept that same energy for all the women who are infertile.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="13570" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32261488&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Having children and/or not being able to have children is a common deal breaker. When two people want different things in life, it is common for them not to date each other. This includes infertility.</p><p>Unfortunately, while politics and the AP Styleguide tell us a man can be a woman just by wanting to, biology and science prevent them from having things like a uterus, a womb, or one of them fallopian tubes. If you want to have a child and the other person lacks the equipment to have a child, there might be more compatible people for each of you out there and it's silly to waste each other time.</p><p>The odd thing about this video is that I don't *think* this woman is trans herself. But views it a red flag that if a guy didn't want to date her because she was trans, it's a reason not to date him even though she's not. And look, to each their own. Like many right wing-blogs, we here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website strive to be open-minded and tolerant AF.</p><p>Date whoever you want for whatever reason you want. Whether <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/demi-lovato-dating-aliens" target="_blank">it be aliens</a>, virtue signaling your wokeness to the internet, or starting and raising a family. Love is love.</p><p><p>

## Celtics coach shuts down  reporter's 'royal family' question with a lesson in Christianity and the REAL Royal Family

The first group doesn't give a rip about the royal family and hasn't since we broke up with England and are never, ever, ever getting back together. The second group squees over the thought of the "Royals" and is lame. Boston Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla holds it down for the first group. In the second group is a reporter wanting to know if meeting the "royal couple" gave him the warm fuzzies.</p><p>I guess William and Kate are in town and went to a basketball game.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

</p><p>I'll be honest, I forget William and Kate exist.

## 'Come see me, bro': Israeli UFC fighter issues a challenge to Ye after his anti-semitic comments

Levy is also Israeli. As you might imagine, the reporters felt he might have thoughts on recent comments made by Ye. The rapper formally known as Kanye West who went from "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/show-notes-ye" target="_blank">the Jews are out to get me</a>" to "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-burr-kanye" target="_blank">we need to be open-minded of nazis</a>" so subtly you barely noticed.</p><p>Levy? Not a fan of Ye's.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Natan Levy calls out Kanye West: "If you got a problem with me or my people, come see me, bro."<br /><br />Full <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UFCOrlando?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UFCOrlando</a> post-fight scrum ▶️ <a href="https://t.co/vHPX2Qdnnh">https://t.co/vHPX2Qdnnh</a> <a href="https://t.co/BslNzjCJFT">pic.twitter.com/BslNzjCJFT</a><br />— MMAFighting.com (@MMAFighting) <a href="https://twitter.com/MMAFighting/status/1599221924835401729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Levi said that life is too short to hate, and to the hateful people he pities "sucks for you."</p><p>But he had a special message for Ye:</p><blockquote>To Kanye West, if you have a problem with me or my people, come see me bro. </blockquote><p>It isn't 100% clear he meant a fight. In the NFL, when DeSean Jackson made anti-semitic comments, Julian Edelman (who is Jewish) <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/09/us/julian-edelman-desean-jackson-trnd" target="_blank">wanted to have a conversation with him</a> and offered to go with Jackson to the US Holocaust Museum:</p><blockquote>I know he said some ugly things but I do see an opportunity to have a conversation...his world needs a little more love, compassion and empathy.</blockquote><p>However, while ALL anti-semitism is bad, there are levels. Saying you believe Hitler was a good dude and that we shouldn't be so hard on Nazis as Ye did is on a whole other one. So I'm assuming Levy was NOT talking about a conversation and an educational field trip. More so a jiujitsu lesson. A harsh one.</p><p><p>

## Twitter users hit Joe Biden with another brutal fact check over his misleading job creation numbers

In the olden days, if a Democrat was challenged on a talking point, it would get throttled or buried. Now that the playing field is being leveled, you have fact-checks placed on Joe Biden tweets. Or, not so much fact checks but... context addendums?</p><p>Either way, Biden's junk about creating more jobs than anyone ever is being called out as bullplop. Here's the current graphic he's attempting to share.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">We’re building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out by creating more jobs than any Administration in history at this point in a presidency. <a href="https://t.co/BPGZapSKTM">pic.twitter.com/BPGZapSKTM</a><br />— President Biden (@POTUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1598759263643500545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Twitter users feel this is missing some necessary context. "The spike in jobs is more accurately attributed to the lifting of [SCHMOVID] restrictions at the state and local level. These are not 'new' jobs but instead jobs that are returning to the economy [SCHMOVID]."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="e4b69" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32252060&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>It's all about having fun with numbers. Is it true that since January 2021 there has been a net of +10.5 million jobs? Yes. It is ALSO true that if you start at January 2020, there has only been a net of +1.4 million jobs, when you factor in the jobs lost when the country shut down during the pandemic, that was then brought back when the country reopened.</p><p>You could also say that in the eight months before Biden, there was a net positive of +12 million jobs. That is 1.5 more million than after Biden.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://t.co/4wJYMk8EY4">pic.twitter.com/4wJYMk8EY4</a><br />— Dr. Nickarama (@nickaramaOG) <a href="https://twitter.com/nickaramaOG/status/1599546317813952513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>There wasn't job growth based on any Biden policy. Unless you count the government telling people they are allowed to open again after forcing them to shut down as a "policy."</p><p>As of this writing, this misleading Biden graph is still up. The last time the White House got fact-checked so hard by Twitter, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/white-house-tweet" target="_blank">they deleted the tweet</a>.</p><p>The White House is creating a metric that only applies to Joe Biden. Then using that metric to claim Joe Biden is history's greatest job creator. Context matters. It's why leftists are unhappy context can be shared on Twitter now.</p><p><p>

She's learning about winning and losing, recovering from mistakes, training, and accountability. Accountability is key in <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-college-football-chants" target="_blank">college football</a>, as the 1-11 Colorado Buffaloes learn the hard way during a meeting with new Head Coach Deion Sanders.</p><p>It's not unheard of for a coach to dress down a team after going 1-11. It is unheard of for a coach to do so during their FIRST MEETING with his new team. Sanders just took the job with Colorado. The students were probably all like "OMG, it's Deion Sanders." Sanders was like, "OMG, a lot of you should go somewhere else."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">“I’m bringing my own luggage. And it’s Louis” <br /><br />Deion telling 1-11 Colorado that most of them better pack their bags and hit the transfer portal <a href="https://t.co/LIdCkPK6TP">pic.twitter.com/LIdCkPK6TP</a><br />— Unnecessary Roughness (@UnnecRoughness) <a href="https://twitter.com/UnnecRoughness/status/1599585382076600320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote><em>It ain’t gonna be no more of a mess that these wonderful fans, the student body and some of your parents have put up with for probably two decades now. I’m coming, and when I get here, it’s gonna be changed. So I want y’all to get ready to go ahead and jump in the portal and do whatever you’re gonna get because if more of you jump in, the more room you make.</em></blockquote><p>The "transfer portal" is for <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/grizzly-bear-college-wrestlers" target="_blank">college athletes</a> who want to transfer to a new school. It allows coaches to track who wants to go somewhere else. Not unlike the portal Big Tech set up for the Biden Administration to track criticisms they want to be deleted. </p><p>Coach Prime, during his first meeting with his new team, was to tell them if they want to continue playing football they should see what other coaches want them. Because there is next to no chance of them playing for Colorado with him as head coach. Not after going 1-11, and when he's coming from a school (Jackson State) that he led to back-to-back championships. </p><p>Coach Prime expects results. If you aren't delivering, he will bring in people who will.</p><p>It's an important life lesson unless you are looking for a career in politics. There you are free to fail as much as you want.</p><p><p>

## Ye accuses Elon Musk of being one of thirty half-Chinese genetic hybrids, and Musk's response is perfect

Kanye was a lyrical genius. That was almost twenty years ago. It's 2022 and we now have Ye writing <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-burr-kanye" target="_blank">Hitler fan fiction</a>. Going off the grid would have been the best idea for Ye, and maybe detransition back into Kanye. Instead, he opted to rant on Instagram. Not about Hitler, for a change. But he did call Elon Musk a genetically engineered Chinese hybrid who is the first of many Elons.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Kanye West just posted this on Instagram <a href="https://t.co/gEgwe2aQ96">pic.twitter.com/gEgwe2aQ96</a><br />— Whole Mars Catalog (@WholeMarsBlog) <a href="https://twitter.com/WholeMarsBlog/status/1599536747985383424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS ELON COULD BE HALF CHINESE?<br /></blockquote><p>Yes.</p><blockquote>TAKE A CHINESE GENIUS AND MATE THEM WITH A SOUTH AFRICAN SUPER MODEL. AND WE HAVE AN ELON. I SAY AN ELON BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY MADE 10 TO 30 ELON’S AND HE’S THE FIRST GENETIC HYBRID THAT STUCK …. WELL LET’S NOT FORGET ABOUT OBAMA.</blockquote><p>He then apologized for "cursing in church," but he doesn't have "another word for Obama yet." Soooo... he's using the word Obama as a swear word?</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="54e29" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32251836&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Now that Ye has moved on <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ye-tim-pool" target="_blank">from the Jews</a> to the Chinese, I'm sure there will be more calls to denounce him. That would be one way of responding. Or, if you choose not to because it requires you to take the insane rantings of a crazy person seriously, you can respond as Elon Prime did.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Lmaooo<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1599600930755731456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I take that as a compliment!<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1599588240998428673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>I'll be frank, having Elon Prime being one of many Elon's wouldn't be the worst thing. Kinda like an IRL Jamie Maddox, the Multiple Man. Musk can send one of his clones to expose Facebook the way Elon Prime has exposed Twitter. Then they could all have tea with Professor Xavier.</p><p>Sadly, I'm 99.86% sure there is only one Elon Musk. And Ye should consider taking a nap.</p><p><p>
