Officials can quickly see whether a card is Real ID-compliant by looking for the gold star in the upper right-hand corner.</p><p>When the bill passed, states initially had a 2008 compliance deadline. But after some states and US territories refused to play ball, the cutoff faced delay after delay. Despite the ever-shifting deadlines, 13 states rolled out support in 2012. The list grew in the following years as reluctant states faced the prospect of having their residents blocked from flights.

I've had a little bit of hands-on time with the new hero, who can shift into different forms and is all about closing the gap between his team and the enemy.

Ramattra seems like a powerful (and fun!) addition to the roster, which could prompt more tank players to pay for the premium pass to unlock him as swiftly as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>However, adding a new tank to the mix could make queue times longer for many folks. Not enough players are opting for support heroes, which has led to lengthy waits for tank and damage players to get into a match.

Yoti has said it doesn\u2019t know exactly which facial characteristics its software uses to make judgments. The AI is also more likely to incorrectly estimate someone\u2019s age depending on their gender and skin tone. In general, it\u2019s the least accurate when examining female faces with dark skin and the most accurate when looking at light-skinned males. However, Meta claims it has found a lot of success using Yoti's software. On Instagram, for instance, it says that the technology has stopped 96 percent of teens from changing their birthdays to make it seem like they are over the age of 18. In the case of Facebook Dating, it\u2019s also one of those instances where whatever concerns people have with the technology may be outweighed by the fact it\u2019s being used to protect minors from online predators.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Facebook Dating age verification is currently only available in the US.

Bear this in mind when I talk about this prototype <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/honor-magic-vs-worldwide-q1-2023-105534945.html\"><ins>Honor Magic VS</ins></a> that I\u2019ve been diddling around with for the last few days. I\u2019m actually pretty impressed by it, although I\u2019ve been asked not to make any solid conclusions about its non-final hardware, software, imaging, performance and display quality.</p><p>The Magic VS is the company\u2019s second folding phone, albeit the first that\u2019ll be available on sale outside of China when it hits selected global markets at the start of 2023. It\u2019s a close cousin of Honor\u2019s first folder, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/honor-magic-v-foldable-smartphone-153214121.html\"><ins>Magic V</ins></a>, which was first released at the start of 2022, and this feels like a polish, rather than an evolution, of the existing model. The major difference is a vastly redesigned hinge with far fewer parts, which should make it more reliable. And the company promises that the handset will withstand 400,000 folds, or more than 100 per day for the better part of a decade. It\u2019s also two grams lighter than Samsung\u2019s Z Fold 4, which Honor is very proud of, but it\u2019s still only two grams.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The rest of the differences between the Magic VS and the Magic V are all fairly minor; a 5,000mAh battery, up from the last model\u2019s 4,750mAh. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 gets swapped for an 8+, and there\u2019s one major change on the imaging front. Whereas the V was packing a trio of 50-megapixel lenses, the VS dropped the third in favor of an 8-megapixel, f/2.4 3x optical zoom. Of course, I can\u2019t talk about the power of those beefy zoom lenses, or the speed at which it takes an image. Or that, much like many other Android handsets, you do wish that images weren\u2019t so washed out.</p><p>As for the displays, you\u2019ll find the 6.45-inch exterior OLED screen is no slouch, especially since it has a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Honor knows that most people will default to the external display for the bulk of their smartphone use, and so it\u2019s almost the first thought here. The 21:9 ratio is still cramped, and initially disorientating, but it\u2019s hardly a deal breaker. And, if I\u2019m honest, you\u2019ll accept a slightly narrow external display in order to get at that 7.9-inch, foldable OLED inside. Now, it\u2019s not as high-res, or as fast (it tops out at 90Hz) but it\u2019s just so much bigger that you\u2019ll want to use it as much as you possibly can.</p><figure><img alt=\"Image of the Honor Magic VS closed on a table.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/961b6ec0-74bb-11ed-bcbd-69e6c79692fd\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Honor says that the display is \u201ccreaseless,\u201d a term which I\u2019ll take a small amount of issue with, if only because there\u2019s no such thing. Hold the device face-on and, when watching video or browsing, you\u2019ll barely notice the crease unless you catch the light at a bad angle. Sit anywhere off center, and you can see the bumps in the terrain just fine \u2013 but that\u2019s not to say that this is a dealbreaker at all. Just that some promises sound better on paper than they do when you\u2019re looking at a very faint ridge in a flexible OLED display.</p><p>One thing I can talk about is the hinge, which helps the two halves of the handset fold flat (except for the dreaded camera bump) and sit very comfortably in my pocket. No doubt, this is still a hulking slab of a device, with a 6.45-inch display that\u2019ll be uncomfortable if you\u2019ve a penchant for ultra-skinny jeans. But if you\u2019re looking for something that\u2019ll pull double duty as a slate, this feels like the most elegant in the admittedly limited pantheon.</p><p>I probably can\u2019t draw conclusions about the speed of the power button-mounted fingerprint sensor, or the camera face unlock. Certainly, you wouldn\u2019t expect a Snapdragon 8+ handset to stutter, especially when it\u2019s paired with 12GB storage, as is the case here. Honor gave strict instructions not to test app performance on the device, but I can\u2019t imagine that \u2013 given the performance of what\u2019s pre-loaded, this device will struggle to deal with much. I did try out a very popular Battle Royale-type game, that I won\u2019t name to respect Honor\u2019s wishes, and it ran beautifully.</p><p>The Magic VS won\u2019t ship with, but does support, Honor\u2019s Magic Pen stylus input, which I\u2019d say is a good start, but not really what this device should be about. After all, the benefit of a device like this is in what it can offer you when you need to get a little blast of focused work done when you\u2019re out and about. (Okay, that\u2019s my interest, I\u2019m sure others just want a bigger screen to play <em>Fortnite</em> on, and that\u2019s absolutely okay.) If Honor shipped this thing with a little stand and a matching wireless keyboard (or both) then I can see it becoming every commuter's dream purchase.</p><p>Now, here\u2019s something that I think should make the folks over at Samsung feel just a little bit jittery. It\u2019s an imperfect comparison, but imagine you\u2019re keeping an eye on the Z Fold 4, currently retailing for $1,700 in the US. Honor\u2019s planning on selling the Magic VS for 7,499RMB in China, which shakes out to around $1,048. Now, for one, Honor probably won\u2019t sell to the US market, and taxes and exchange rates will play their part. But if the final version of this handset can offer something very similar to the Z Fold 4 for a significantly lower price, I can imagine it turning plenty of would-be Fold owners\u2019 heads.</p><p>Now, as I said, I can\u2019t make any solid conclusions about this device, but what I can say is that I really think it\u2019s worthy of a full review when it hits global markets early next year. And that there\u2019s enough here to say that Honor may be making a very compelling case to be spoken about as a fair competitor to Samsung at the highest end of the Android space.</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/pixel-7-pro-updates-clear-calling-vpn-pixel-buds-spatial-audio-180029913.html?src=rss", "title": "Pixel 7 update brings promised Clear Calling and free VPN", "date_published": "2022-12-05 18:00:29+00:00", "description": "<p>Google is releasing its latest round of Pixel updates today, including the free VPN the company teased at its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7-pixel-7-pro-pixel-watch-event-wrap-up-170055623.html\"><ins>October event</ins></a>.
