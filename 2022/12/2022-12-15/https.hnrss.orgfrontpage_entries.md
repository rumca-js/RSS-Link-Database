<p>Hey HN, cofounder of Readwise here. We've been working on this cross-platform reader app for about 2 years, excited to finally share it in public beta.<p>Probably the most notable thing that makes Reader unique is that it supports almost any content type you could want to save/read/highlight:<p>* web pages<p>* emails/newsletters<p>* PDFs<p>* ePubs<p>* twitter threads<p>* youtube videos (with transcripts)<p>* RSS feeds<p>With all of your knowledge content in one place, we built powerful reading and highlighting, as well as a bunch of novel triage/organization features, so you can actually consume & stay on top of that content!<p>There are also a lot of advanced features too, such as text-to-speech, GPT3 questions/summaries, super powerful highlighting (that includes markup and images), complex filtering/search (with our own query language), sleek mobile triage UI, keyboard shortcuts for reading/everything, integrations with note-taking apps, a browser extension for both saving pages and highlighting them, and much more.<p>If anyone's interested in more product details, as well as our business model, etc, we wrote a detailed launch post: <a href="https://blog.readwise.io/the-next-chapter-of-reader-public-beta/" rel="nofollow">https://blog.readwise.io/the-next-chapter-of-reader-public-b...</a><p>Predicting a common question: Reader is part of the Readwise subscription pricing right now in beta -- there's a 30 day free trial and then it's paid at ~$8usd/month. We also promise to not raise this price for existing subscribers.<p>Reader is also fairly technically interesting -- our iOS, Android and webapp all work fully offline and sync your reading data/progress with eachother. Our search on web is built with wasm sqlite. We have a fairly intense pipeline for cleaning web articles (removing ads/styling). We share lot of modules around syncing/highlighting across all platforms, etc...<p>Happy to answer any questions :)</p>

## Ask HN: How might HN build a social network together?

<p>I have a concept for a social network that would eliminate many pain points. I'm sure others do too.<p>How could we build a communal product for the public? Theoretically, this approach would result in a better product. Practically, it seems nearly impossible.<p>What are your thoughts?<p>Edit:<p>Let me give an example that I have been thinking about since 2009.<p>It requires a fundamental change from the reach model towards concentric social circles. The social network would allow users to arrange into small topical groups called social circles. These social circles would have a cap of 10 (arbitrary number) members. Each user could take part in many social circles. This inherently limits reach and therefore reduces the burden of misinformation, abuse, and moderation.<p>This model closely mirrors real social interactions and allows for both private and intimate communication. It also offers a profitable advertising opportunity. A social circle reflects its members’ interests and context.</p>

## Ask HN: What prevents a company from hiring remote employees internationally?

<p>I've been looking at remote opportunities and realized that a huge portion of companies hiring remotely requires you to be in certain regions (US, EMEA, APAC) — fully international remote is rare. Personally, I'm interested in "remote ok" startups (YC-backed & otherwise) but I'm outside of their specified regions and hesitant to reach out because of that.<p>It's puzzling to me because I've been successful in previous fully international remote roles (& have lots of experience building remote workflows), so I'd like to understand the motivation behind why and identify potential solutions to enabling it, as a thought exercise driven by curiousity.<p>From my perspective, there are a few barriers to this:<p>- Timezone. This is a huge one when it comes to synchronous communications, especially if you're in the driver's seat (as a team lead etc.) Disparate timezones between team members can break a team's velocity if you're not built to be fully asynchronous from the ground-up, which IMO requires a cultural shift in communications (moving towards async comms where meetings are kept to bare minimum and/or only used for social face time). What can we do to make the switch to async comms easier?<p>- No "human" touch. Socializing is critical because humans have an innate desire to connect; nothing can replace real-world connections. This is why off-sites exist for remote companies. They're way easier to arrange when your team isn't spread across continents, and arranging for international off-sites can be cost prohibitive as a startup. I believe there is nothing we can do to replace that human touch (not even the metaverse), so what can we do to make travel planning for companies easier and/or less costly?<p>- Difficult to figure compensation scale. Remote roles typically peg compensations to CoL (Cost of Living). The typical setup I've seen is applying a CoL multiplier to the base comp. for the role and tacking on +/-20% for competitiveness (or as an "error correction"). How can we help them make these decisions easier?<p>- Lack of legal presence. Having no legal entity in the country you're <i>hiring</i> in is a non sequitur, and setting up a legal entity per-country-per-hire is not scalable (beyond setting up the entity itself, you need to be aware of local labour laws, your tax obligations, insurance, etc.) I think Deel (https://www.deel.com/) has already solved this.<p>- Compliance & regulations. The company may be handling sensitive data and/or has PCI/HIPAA compliance obligations. Or it may be a government organization where security/background checks must be performed. Systems/data access may also need to be scrutinized in situation of audits and documented ahead-of-time. Not much we can do here and I think it's a question of risk, so no international remote is probably for the best.<p>I'm sure I'm missing something important. What do you think?<p>(edit: formatting)<p>(edit2: fix typo & re-phrase)<p>(edit3: typo)</p>

## Meticulous (YC S21) Is Hiring #3 Founding Engineer in London

<p>Hey HN,<p>I'm Gabriel, founder of Meticulous.<p>Our mission is to make the world's code safe, performant and reliable. We're starting with a tool to catch JavaScript regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor and Google. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching JavaScript regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from automatic UI previews to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite (few days per week) founding engineer to join our team of four.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href="https://sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site/Meticulous-values-ab2b90d3324447d58f0720481081c9a6" rel="nofollow">https://sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site/Meticulous-values...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with “HN” in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub.</p>

## Ask HN: What can I do about my declining typing ability as I age?

<p>As I've gotten older, my typing ability has decreased. I'm 51-years-old now, and have been typing non-stop since I got a computer in my 20s.<p>I used to type very naturally and easily, but in the last few years, I've noticed that I make a lot more mistakes. I spend a lot of time hitting backspace. It's not painful, I've just somehow gotten worse at it.<p>It doesn't seem to matter which keyboard I work on. I have a mild ergonomic keyboard for my desk machine (a slight curve), but I'm just as bad on this as I am on my laptop (perfectly straight).<p>Typing long stretches of text now is burdensome. I used to love to type (I've written four books, including an O'Reilly title), but now I tend to avoid it. I've started dictating, in fact.<p>I have no diagnosed arthritic or repetitive stress injury (and again, it's not painful).<p>Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice, coping mechanisms, or solutions?</p>
