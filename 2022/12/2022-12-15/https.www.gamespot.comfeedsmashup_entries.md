<p>Although Henry Cavill will no longer return as Superman, he will still not play Geralt in season 4 of The Witcher, so says a new report. With Cavill's schedule freed up, in theory, fans speculated that Cavill might be able to return to monster hunting, but alas, this is not the case.</p><p>According to a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/henry-cavill-the-witcher-return-not-happening-superman-exit-1235462635/">Variety</a>, Cavill will not return to play Geralt of Rivia in future seasons of The Witcher. Cavill will appear as the character in the upcoming third season, but afterwards Liam Hemsworth will take over the role. Upon <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-is-leaving-the-witcher-for-season-4-replaced-by-liam-hemsworth/1100-6508734/">the original announcement of Cavill's departure</a>, the fan response was immense and largely negative. A change.org petition asking for Cavill's return <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-showrunner-discusses-henry-cavills-departure/1100-6509722/">garnered hundreds of thousands of signatures</a>.</p><p>In October, Cavill appeared in a secret <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-reveals-how-they-shot-super-secret-superman-cameo/1100-6508720/">Black Adam cameo</a> and announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-is-officially-back-as-superman-going-forward/1100-6508559/">he would return as the Man of Steel in an upcoming film</a>. Shortly after, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gunn-will-co-lead-dc-studios-steering-upcoming-dceu-movies-shows-and-cartoons/1100-6508620/">James Gunn and Peter Safran took over as leads of DC's film, TV, and animation projects</a>. Gunn since announced that he is penning a Superman film, focusing on a younger version of the character, and that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-wont-be-returning-as-superman/1100-6510069/">DC would not longer be going forward with a Henry Cavill-led project</a>. Gunn did claim that he met with Cavill and the two discussed potential future projects that the star could be involved in.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-will-not-return-as-geralt-of-rivia-despite-superman-departure/1100-6510110/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4077809-bestmetacritic.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The past year was a great year for movies. Between major releases on streaming and digital services, along with all those theatrical releases, it can be exceptionally difficult to keep up with every movie released in 2022, and making that even more difficult, how are you supposed to keep up with every good movie released this year? There were well over 400 feature-length movies released in 2022, but what did critics like the most?</p><p dir="ltr">In 2021, there were 925 movies released, according to <a href="https://www.movieinsider.com/movies/2021">Movie Insider</a>, and this includes streaming and direct-to-video. Meanwhile, Statista claims 403 movies were released theatrically in the US and Canada in 2021. It's a lot to keep track of, even if that amount is an anomaly (it's not) we can be certain that hundreds and hundreds of movies are released each year.</p><p dir="ltr">However, it is a lot easier to figure out what critics find to be the best. Over on GameSpot's sister site Metacritic, they have rankings for every movie, based on critical reviews and the scores said critics give the movies. And because of this system, we can figure out what critics found to be the top 10 movies of 2022.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's check out some of the best critically reviewed movies of 2022, and we'll keep updating this list throughout the year, as it is sure to change. And speaking of movies, why not <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/10-worst-movies-of-2022-according-to-metacritic-so-far/2900-3998/">check out the worst movies of 2022, ranked by Metacritic</a>? And of course, keep in mind that we're only four months into the year, these lists are all very much subject to change as time marches on.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10.

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4077779-horrormetacritic.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">In 2022, we all saw some amazing movies. It was a long year that gave us blockbusters like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/top-gun-maverick-review-36-years-later-and-back-in-the-danger-zone/1900-6417877/">Top Gun: Maverick</a> and hilarious comedies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/10-best-movies-making-fun-of-the-music-industry/2900-4458/">Weird: The Al Yankovic story</a>. However, 2022 was one of the best years for horror in decades.</p><p dir="ltr">And while really great movies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nope-review-jordan-peeles-alien-invasion-movie-isnt-what-you-expect/1900-6417920/">Nope</a> and Black Phone got a lot of people talking, they weren't even the 10 best horror movies of the year, according to Metacritic. Once again, GameSpot is taking a look at sister site Metacritic, a critic review aggregator, to figure out what the top 10 horror movies of 2022 are.</p><p dir="ltr">Metacritic looks at approved critics' reviews and scores--sometimes giving a score to the review as well, based on the writing--and gives the movie in question a rating based on the score's average. From there, we looked at all the new horror movies on Metacritic this year--ones with seven or more reviews--and put them into a top 10 list.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's the most wild part of this year's list. As far as review scores go, every movie on this list is in the top 100 horror movies of all time. That's right. That's how good this year's slate of scary films was--they're all-timers.</p><p dir="ltr">From the surprise hit Barbarian to a few Shudder exclusives, there are a lot of great horror films to check out, if you missed them. So below, you'll find the top horror movies of 2022, according to Metacritic. And make sure to check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-10-best-movies-of-2022-according-to-metacritic-so-far/2900-4015/">best movies of 2022</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/worst-movies-of-2022-according-to-metacritic-so-far/2900-3998/">worst movies of 2022</a>, both according to Metacritic, as well.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10.

<p dir="ltr">Yellowjackets has been renewed for Season 3 ahead of its recently announced Season 2 premiere in March 2023. <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/12/yellowjackets-season-3-renewal-showtime-chris-mccarthy-programming-strategy-slate-review-1235200276/">Deadline</a> was first to report.</p><p dir="ltr">"With Yellowjackets' runaway success in Season 1 and the pent-up anticipation for Season 2, we wanted to maximize the momentum by fast-tracking Season 3 now," said Chris McCarthy, president and CEO of Showtime and Paramount Media Networks. "The show's ambition is only exceeded by its execution, and I thank the incredible creative team behind it."</p><p dir="ltr">McCarthy's mention of Season 1 is a reference to the show's renewal for Season 2 only five episodes into the first season's broadcast run. Around that time, GameSpot's Mason Downey called Yellowjackets <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/showtimes-yellowjackets-is-a-modern-heir-to-lost/1100-6498905/">a "modern heir to Lost"</a> well worth a look--and not to be fooled by the show's teen-show trappings. Downey also called the show "brutal" and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/showtimes-yellowjackets-is-a-modern-heir-to-lost/1100-6498905/">a rewarding "week-to-week mystery story."</a> Season 1 also racked up a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/yellowjackets">100% score on Rotten Tomatoes</a> and received seven Emmy nominations.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yellowjackets-gets-season-3-renewal-ahead-of-season-2-premiere/1100-6510100/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Avatar: Way of Water Director James Cameron Claims 3D Is A Staple In Theaters

<p>In a recent interview, Cameron claims that the continued support for 3D in digital film infrastructure shows that there is still active interest in the technology and that it is a staple for movie theaters.</p><p>In a conversation with <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/12/james-cameron-avatar-the-way-of-water-terminator-remorse-sigourney-weaver-kate-winslet-7-minute-breath-holding-swim-1235197918/">Deadline</a>, James Cameron said, "it's sobering to remember that when Avatar was released, there were 3,000 digital 3D screens in North America and about 6,000 worldwide. Today, there are 120,000 digital 3D screens worldwide." To put that into perspective, assuming Cameron's numbers are correct, that is 20 times the amount of digital 3D screens there were back in 2009. While the cultural conversation and buzz around 3D has gone down, the technology has become quietly normalized.</p><p>According to Cameron, Texas Instruments built the ability to do a high frame rate and 3D into their chip set and server architecture. Digital projectors since then have all been 3D enabled. This has meant that 3D is kind of a staple, though it does not have the same impact for every release. As an example, he said, "A big MCU movie in 3D might be selling 30 percent of its tickets in 3D as opposed to on the first Avatar, where we were at 85 percent."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-way-of-water-director-james-cameron-claims-3d-is-a-staple-in-theaters/1100-6510099/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>It's been five years since Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi polarized Star Wars fans and the Glass Onion director is still interested in coming back. There hasn't been any recent update for Johnson's proposed trilogy of Star Wars movies, and if those never end up happening, he'd be disappointed. Still, the director remains hopeful. </p><p>"It wouldn’t be the end of the world for anyone, I think," Johnson told <a href="https://www.insider.com/rian-johnson-interview-glass-onion-star-wars-2022-12">Insider</a>. "But I would be sad. I love the world. I love the people. I love Star Wars fans. I love the passion of how they engage in it. There's nothing like telling a story in this world and then experiencing people truly connecting to it and letting you know that. It’s extraordinary."</p><p>When it was announced that Johnson would helm his own trilogy after The Last Jedi, the Star Wars franchise was at a completely different place in pop culture. A lot has changed in five years and Rise of Skywalker was <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-9-course-correction-truth/">reported to be a "course correction"</a> after some Star Wars fans took The Last Jedi as an attack on the fandom, and even harassed star Kelly Marie Tran off of social media. Johnson moved on to make the murder mystery Knives Out, which was a huge hit, earning him his first Oscar nomination.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rian-johnson-would-be-sad-if-he-never-worked-on-star-wars-again/1100-6510105/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The studio is now driven towards creating more cohesive content than ever before in order to accommodate the game's new seasonal system and free-to-play, battle pass-driven business model, and naturally, player reactions to these changes have been mixed.</p><p dir="ltr">But just as players are learning to adjust to all the differences between Overwatch and its shiny new sequel, its developers are as well.

<p dir="ltr">A feature film adaptation of Death Stranding from Kojima Productions and Barbarian's Hammerstone Studios has been announced. <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/12/death-stranding-film-from-barbarian-producer-alex-lebovici-in-works-1235200209/">Deadline</a> was first to report.</p><p dir="ltr">The announcement comes just one week after veteran game designer Hideo Kojima <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-officially-announced/1100-6509825/">unveiled a sequel to the divisive title at The Game Awards</a>. Reportedly, the film will "introduce new elements and characters" within the Death Stranding Universe. "I couldn't be more excited about this new partnership with Hammerstone Studios," Kojima said. "This is a pivotal moment for the franchise and I'm really looking forward to collaborating with them in bringing Death Stranding to the big screen."</p><p dir="ltr">No casting information or details on the movie's writer have been announced, but Alex Lebovici of Hammerstone Studios had said "this film will be an authentic Hideo Kojima production," which likely means much like in the game designer's blockbuster titles, Kojima will also be involved in the script in some capacity. However, that has not yet been confirmed. The Death Stranding film is currently in development, so future announcements will follow.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-film-adaptation-announced-from-kojima-productions-barbarians-hammerstone-studios/1100-6510089/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">The upcoming Harry Potter game Hogwarts Legacy is only a few short weeks away from release on February 10, and a new showcase video from publisher Warner Bros Games displays over a half-hour of new gameplay. The video begins with game director Alan Tew showing off Hogwarts Legacy's broom flying mechanics as the character zips around the large open world outside of the magical school.</p><p dir="ltr">As the player-character flies around, the game's development team explains how you can find quests by exploring the game world, including the village of Hogsmeade. It also includes a section where the player rides a hippogriff, a mount straight from the movies that can fly into the air.</p><p dir="ltr">From there, the video transitions into a demonstration of the game's combat mechanics, which include a small preview of its tech tree. It also includes a number of the darker spells in the Harry Potter universe, with even the killing curse Avada Kedavra making an appearance. The combat arena lasts for well over five minutes, so if you want to see that in action, we definitely recommend checking that out. The showcase ends with a lengthy look at the customizable elements of the game, including the hub known as the Room of Requirement.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-hogwarts-legacy-video-shows-off-advanced-combat-broom-flying/1100-6510086/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Starfield features a number of factions that players will get to interact with and influence, but they won't necessarily find themselves in charge of these organizations. In a new Constellation Questions video, lead quest designer Will Shen spoke about Bethesda's approach to populating the universe of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a> with these groups and how players will be able to interact with all of the factions independently of each other.</p><div>          </div><p>"One of the early things we decided on was making sure that the main quest actually kind of gives you a little bit of a tour of the settled systems and all of the major players there, so that we can give you a taste of what they're going to be up to," Shen explained. "We decided we really want to make sure that you can play through all the faction lines independently of each other. And this time around, we really want the stories to be a little more personal."</p><p>One example of this approach that Shen mentioned was the Freestar Rangers, an organization of peacekeepers who can be influenced to uphold the ideals of justice over the demands of industry. The decisions that players make will have far-reaching consequences for these factions, while your companions will have "a lot of opinions and points of view about what decisions you'll be making" in the main storyline.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-will-let-you-interact-with-and-influence-every-major-faction/1100-6510081/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
