Well, Michael Burry has been saying that for a long while now, and his recent bets on the stock market seem to suggest he's putting his money where his mouth is, by moving heavily into real assets.\n\nPeople who know Michael Burry know that he's controversial. He's always talking about doom and gloom, and he's often suggesting that the worst stuff is just around the corner. Some say he's wrong, but others say he's just always a little early in his predictions.\n\nRight now, Burry's latest 13F filings suggest that he's preparing for the stock market to take an even bigger dive, as he seems to be moving more into real assets, and away from riskier tech stocks. But as always, he's just one man: we should take everything with a grain of salt.\n\nLet me know your thoughts below.\n\n0:00 - Michael Burry's new prediction\n0:45 - A brief history of Burry\n2:45 - Why Burry is buying up real assets\n4:57 - Masterworks insert\n6:04 - Where money moves during economic crisis\n7:48 - Trends are better predictors than people\n\n\u25ba IMPORTANT LINKS:\nEnter your email via the link below for free weekly lessons and insights into becoming financially free, investing, global tax and corporate structures, passports, residencies, and more.\nJOIN: https://www.abundantia.co/\n\n\u25ba SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u2022 Abundantia Instagram: @abundantia.co https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/\n\u2022 Sorelle's Instagram: @sorelleamore  https://instagram.com/sorelleamore\n\u2022 Leon's Instagram: @leonhill  https://instagram.com/leonhill\n\u2022 Abundantia Twitter: https://twitter.com/abundantiaco\n\u2022 Abundantia Facebook: http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance\n\nSorelle and Leon.\nFounders, Abundantia\n\nLiability Disclaimer: https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer\n*We may earn a commission if you buy any products or services via the links in this video's description.
