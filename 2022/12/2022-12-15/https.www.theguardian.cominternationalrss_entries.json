While this is admittedly a bit of an oversimplification, if we\u2019re going on definitions alone, a healthy portion of NBA franchises are, then, insane. The theory that teams are just a sum of their parts \u2013 and thus the higher profile and more talented the parts, the better the team \u2013 has been disproved time and time again. Sure, having a superstar or two is incredibly helpful (and maybe even necessary) for summiting the highest heights of NBA success, but it\u2019s not a the-more-All-Stars-the-merrier proposition. One needs look no further than the smoldering pile of rubble that was the hopes for a championship of the Big Three in Brooklyn, or last year\u2019s disastrous Los Angeles Lakers, for evidence that more isn\u2019t always <em>more</em> when it comes to superstar talent. And yet, despite its definitively unsatisfactory track record, teams seem to try this method time and time again.</p><p>The most recent example of this insanity-borne-out can be found in the frozen tundra of Minneapolis.

The expectations for the team, at the time, were about as low as possible, which made for an all the more feel-good story as the suddenly gelling Timberwolves stacked improbable wins \u2013 and, markedly, enjoyed the hell out of themselves \u2013 leading to one of only two playoff appearances for the team since the halcyon days of Kevin Garnett in 2004. The Wolves\u2019 No 1 overall draft pick in 2021, Anthony Edwards, seemed to be especially thriving, with a new coach in Chris Finch and a roster that, while lacking in defense, facilitated his growth and gave him the space to do what he does best, most notably <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyNodFiofS8\">dunking on people within an inch of their lives</a>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/15/minnesota-timberwolves-superteam-nba-failure\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/15/transformer-by-simon-doonan-review-a-walk-on-the-wild-side", "title": "Transformer by Simon Doonan review \u2013 a walk on the wild side", "date_published": "2022-12-15 09:00:17+00:00", "description": "<p>The former creative director of Barney\u2019s remembers a beautifully transgressive moment in pop culture</p><p>In an age when discussions of gender so often come with a side helping of earnest academic debate and social media controversy, it comes as sweet relief to read Simon Doonan\u2019s charming new book about the glittering world of 1970s glam.

It was several hours before the official announcement of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/08/queen-elizabeth-ii-britains-longest-reigning-monarch-dies-aged-96\">her death</a>; at this point, doctors were \u201cconcerned\u201d for her health. But the image of a BBC newsreader in black tie and jacket gave the game away. This was the moment that the national broadcaster had been nervously rehearsing for decades. Strict protocols were in place to ensure no embarrassments. If the BBC had gone to black tie, I thought, Her Majesty must have already passed.<br /><br />By the time I reached my gig that evening, the announcement had been made. I sat up late into the night, watching reactions to the news on TV. Flying home the next day, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. Would people be sombre or shocked? Flags flew at half-mast, but Heathrow was as bustling as ever and, driving home to Dorset, things looked pretty much as they always did.<br /><br />Stopping for coffee at Winchester services on the M3, I got my first taste of the mood that would come to dominate the following days. Either side of the entrance to the food hall, the video billboards that usually advertised the delights available within now showed a portrait of the Queen, alternating with her royal cypher and her dates, 1926-2022. I took a photo and sent it to my brother-in-law. I found it hard not to see it as a crass attempt by advertising companies to jump on the bandwagon of national grieving. As I drove on into the night, a long-planned campaign was being put into action, its aim to ensure that we all participated in mourning the loss of the Queen.<br /><br />What to make of patriotism? To paraphrase Martin Luther King, the arc of history is long, but it bends towards inclusivity. It\u2019s why corporations believe they can reach a younger demographic by commissioning ads that celebrate diversity, why the National Trust seeks to highlight the connection between slavery and stately homes, and why there is a plus sign at the end of LGBTQ.<br /><br />Patriotism chafes against this trend. Resistant to change, reliant on conformity, it takes pride in immutable symbols and institutions, such as the flag and the armed forces, and prizes assimilation over diversity. While inclusivity presents as an invitation, patriotism is at best an expectation and at worse a demand. Are you with us or against us?<br /><br />I found it hard to disentangle the period of official solemnity from the politics of this country over the past decade. This was a time when those who seemed determined to offend were elevated to the highest offices in the land, using dog-whistles to stir up division. Attempts to have a deeper understanding of our colonial past were met with outrage and reaction. Millions were put through privation and economic hardship. The flag was waved by our politicians more and more, making it mean less and less. Britain became ever more inhospitable to those who choose to make their homes here.</p><p>The two dark sentinels standing guard at Winchester on that September night seemed to silently insist that, before entering, we bow our heads in respect of a version of our national story \u2013 but who decides on that story? And where is it going?<br /><br />For those on the outside looking in, it will take more than the coronation of a new king to bring the country together. In order to feel that they belong, people need to see themselves as part of the national narrative and feel that their experiences are being treated with respect. That is simply not achievable at a time when politics rewards those bent on exclusion.</p><p>Billy Bragg is a singer-songwriter and activist</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/15/mourning-queen-billboards-winchester\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2022/dec/15/a-space-of-radical-black-history-dalstons-gillett-square-in-pictures", "title": "\u2018A space of radical black history\u2019: Dalston\u2019s Gillett Square \u2013 in pictures", "date_published": "2022-12-15 07:00:15+00:00", "description": "<p>With a long musical history, this east London location is now the source of moving community stories, from growing up in care to battling addiction</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2022/dec/15/a-space-of-radical-black-history-dalstons-gillett-square-in-pictures\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/15/every-chemist-has-a-backroom-how-medicalised-fgm-risks-gains-made-in-kenya", "title": "\u2018Every chemist has a backroom\u2019: how medicalised FGM risks gains made in Kenya", "date_published": "2022-12-15 06:30:14+00:00", "description": "<p>A move away from public ceremonies to secret cutting by health workers is one of the greatest threats to eliminating the abusive practice, say campaigners</p><p></p><p>In Kisii town, south-west Kenya, a rundown roadside building houses a pharmacy.

About 9bn years ago, tens of thousands of giant stars ran out of fuel, collapsed upon themselves, and then exploded. The sheer force of these supernova detonations mashed together the matter in the stars\u2019 cores, turning lighter elements like iron into heavier ones like uranium. Flung out by such explosions, trillions of tonnes of uranium traversed the cold universe and wound up near our slowly materialising solar system.</p><p>And here, over roughly 20m years, the uranium and other bits of space dust and debris cohered to form our planet in such a way that the violent tectonics of the young Earth pushed the uranium not towards its hot core but up into the folds of its crust. Within reach, so to speak, of the humans who eventually came along circa 300,000BC, and who mined the uranium beginning in the 1500s, learned about its radioactivity in 1896 and started feeding it into their nuclear reactors 70-odd years ago, making electricity that could be relayed to their houses to run toasters and light up Christmas trees.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/15/dismantling-sellafield-epic-task-shutting-down-decomissioned-nuclear-site\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/15/flying-insect-numbers-plunge-64-since-2004-uk-survey-finds", "title": "Flying insect numbers plunge 64% since 2004, UK survey finds", "date_published": "2022-12-15 06:00:16+00:00", "description": "<p>Scientists behind car number plate study say \u2018potentially catastrophic\u2019 decline must be reversed</p><p>The number of insects splattered on vehicle number plates in Britain fell by 64% between 2004 and 2022, according to a survey.</p><p>Each summer citizen scientists record the number of insect splats on their number plates on an app after a journey.
