<p>From palace officials leaking stories to horrific death threats and the couple’s fury at Harry’s family, this unlikely tale packs a real punch</p><p>As their Netflix series comes to an end, one thing is very clear: Harry and Meghan want us to view this as a love story. The two, for better or for worse, are hopeless romantics and at every stage reiterate just how much they adore one another. While that may have a fair few viewers rolling their eyes, the sweetness mixed in with salacious details makes for a satisfying happily-ever-after.</p><p>We begin typically where the fairytale would begin, on their wedding day. Meghan describes being calm and Harry recounts the events with his signature disbelief that he landed this woman. Even King Charles is talked about lovingly, with Meghan recalling just how charming he was in the wake of her estrangement from her own father and how much it meant for him to walk her down the aisle. A surprising amount of time is given to them gleefully rehashing the details, from Elton John’s performance to the event’s symbolism (Serena Williams overeggs the matter by describing it as “courageous”). The documentary’s access brings in new photographs and footage of the wedding, which somewhat screams “Netflix exclusivity deal.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/15/harry-meghan-volume-2-netflix-review-a-remarkable-reminder-of-how-petty-the-royals-can-be">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Holly Johnson insisted Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s 1984 hit wasn’t a festive song. But he was up against label ZTT’s plans for a nativity video …</p><p>Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s single The Power of Love was never a Christmas song, Holly Johnson complained, when a version was used on the John Lewis festive ad in 2012. He wrote it in 1983 while still on the dole, having given up his art school grant and unsure of his future in music – even though the band were on the brink of success. The song was a paean not to another person, he explained, but to love itself – “a force from above”; death-defying, vampire-smiting. His voice still contained that silvery archness (wasn’t the “hooded claw” a reference to Wacky Races?) but the emotional heft was real. Was this really the guy from Relax?</p><p>But from day one, Johnson never stood a chance extricating The Power of Love from Christmas. It was Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s third single, and third and final No 1. It had just one week at the top, at the start of December 1984, before Band Aid’s Do They Know It’s Christmas? knocked it off. After the shock and awe of previous singles Relax and Two Tribes, The Power of Love’s video was a straightforward nativity scene that barely featured the band – “chocolate box”, as Johnson later lamented.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/15/holly-johnson-the-power-of-love-frankie-goes-to-hollywood-ztt">Continue reading...</a>

It is currently the 13th biggest flop in the entire history of cinema (almost certainly).</p><p>Moonfall was a film about the moon threatening to plummet out of the sky and crash into Earth.

<p>From live Tippett, locked-down Debussy and luminous Charles Koechlin to dazzling Szymanowski and dextrous Beethoven, we pick the outstanding releases of the past 12 months</p><p>After nearly two years in which record companies were seriously compromised in what they could record, whether live or in the studio, things began to get back to normal in 2022. Whether the shifts in genres and repertoire – away from studio recordings of large-scale orchestral and operatic works and towards releases derived from live performances – were part of a gradual change in emphasis that had set in before the pandemic, though, or a direct consequence of it, was hard to determine.</p><p>Certainly the cost of embarking on studio-made recordings of complete operas now looks likely to ensure such projects become permanent rarities. Instead, their places are being mostly filled by CDs and DVDs derived from staged and concert performances, sometimes directly warts and all, sometimes with discreet patching after the event. René Jacobs’s typically quirky account of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/28/weber-der-freischutz-review-rene-jacobs-freiburg-baroque-orchestra">Weber’s Der Freischütz</a> was an exception to that rule, but in the longer term it looks likely that it will mainly be baroque operas with their smaller casts and orchestral forces that get bespoke studio treatment. There were fine examples of these this year with recordings of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/15/early-opera-company-curnyn-handel-amadigi-review-classical-album-of-the-week">Handel’s Amadigi</a> from Christian Curnyn’s Early Opera Company and the rarely performed 1749 score of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/10/rameau-zoroastre-review-alexis-kossenko">Rameau’s Zoroastre</a> from Alexis Kossenko and Les Ambassadeurs – La Grande Écurie.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/15/quirky-revelatory-intimate-the-best-classical-releases-of-2022">Continue reading...</a>

But Georgia Ellery’s lilting voice singing about hills over a gently discordant acoustic guitar is a feint. Stick with it just a few seconds more and you’ll find yourself in a musical landslide where everything from Game Boy SFX and deep, throbbing dubstep to classical violin and comedy vocal effects collide into each other – often within a single track.</p><p>Ellery is accompanied by fellow Guildhall graduate Taylor Skye on production and together they pan for nuggets of sound that have never been put together before. Everything that makes a noise is fair game as they plunder every genre for a possible production style here, a unique chord progression there. I Love You Jennifer B should sound like a nightmare – and sometimes it does – but there’s a current of fun that holds it all together: the cartoonish chopping and reassembling of vocals reminds you that this album is not as po-faced or art-school as it might sound on paper. Though their influences range from the classic songwriting of Stevie Wonder and the pop bravado of Madonna to esoteric jazz and global rhythms, you could argue that Jockstrap’s main influence is dubstep. You can hear a form of the pounding, amphetamine-adjacent, bass-heavy genre reverberating through and energising almost every track on I Love You Jennifer B – occasionally as a wink but more often as a directive to move.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/15/the-50-best-albums-of-2022-no-7-jockstrap-i-love-you-jennifer-b">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Selena Gomez, Lizzo and Tom Holland have all taken breaks from Instagram and Twitter. Others have abandoned social media for good.

## The badly misfiring Timberwolves are proof that NBA rosters aren’t math

<p>As much as NBA owners and general managers like to believe otherwise, successful teams aren’t math: they’re science. Just look at the state of the once-promising Timberwolves</p><p></p><p>It’s been said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results. While this is admittedly a bit of an oversimplification, if we’re going on definitions alone, a healthy portion of NBA franchises are, then, insane. The theory that teams are just a sum of their parts – and thus the higher profile and more talented the parts, the better the team – has been disproved time and time again. Sure, having a superstar or two is incredibly helpful (and maybe even necessary) for summiting the highest heights of NBA success, but it’s not a the-more-All-Stars-the-merrier proposition. One needs look no further than the smoldering pile of rubble that was the hopes for a championship of the Big Three in Brooklyn, or last year’s disastrous Los Angeles Lakers, for evidence that more isn’t always <em>more</em> when it comes to superstar talent. And yet, despite its definitively unsatisfactory track record, teams seem to try this method time and time again.</p><p>The most recent example of this insanity-borne-out can be found in the frozen tundra of Minneapolis. The Minnesota Timberwolves have been, to put it mildly, a historically underwhelming franchise. Entering the 2021-22 season, in fact, the Wolves held the discomfiting crown of being <a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/03/03/minnesota-timberwolves-worst-franchise-sports">the all-time losingest franchise</a> in North American sports, nudging out the NFL’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the dubious distinction. The expectations for the team, at the time, were about as low as possible, which made for an all the more feel-good story as the suddenly gelling Timberwolves stacked improbable wins – and, markedly, enjoyed the hell out of themselves – leading to one of only two playoff appearances for the team since the halcyon days of Kevin Garnett in 2004. The Wolves’ No 1 overall draft pick in 2021, Anthony Edwards, seemed to be especially thriving, with a new coach in Chris Finch and a roster that, while lacking in defense, facilitated his growth and gave him the space to do what he does best, most notably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyNodFiofS8">dunking on people within an inch of their lives</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/15/minnesota-timberwolves-superteam-nba-failure">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former creative director of Barney’s remembers a beautifully transgressive moment in pop culture</p><p>In an age when discussions of gender so often come with a side helping of earnest academic debate and social media controversy, it comes as sweet relief to read Simon Doonan’s charming new book about the glittering world of 1970s glam. At just under 150 pages, it provides a terse reminder that challenging established sexual identities and norms doesn’t only have the potential to be revelatory and liberating, it can also be tons of fun. Doonan establishes this through the snap of his prose and the absence of pretension in his worldview. The result is the inverse of Simon Reynolds’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/07/shock-awe-glam-rock-legacy-simon-reynolds-review" title="">Shock and Awe</a>: Glam Rock and Its Legacy from the Seventies to the Twenty-First Century, published six years ago. While that 700-page doorstop was incredibly smart, useful and true, it also managed to render in pale monochrome a movement that was all about colour.</p><p>Doonan, the former creative director of Barneys, has mastered every hue of glam. It helps that he grounds his analysis in his own story. On the very first page, he describes himself as “a pansy amid the begonias”, setting the tone for a work that’s as much memoir and mash note as historical portrait and tribute. Now 70, he grew up at a time when gay sex was outlawed in his native UK. Though a little younger, I was the ideal age – 14 in 1972 – to also swoon over glam’s platform shoes, shag haircuts and implicit green light to lust after all the other young dudes I desired. Much like Doonan, I viewed the freakiness of glitter as a lifeline as well an encouragement to pursue a path of self-invention and pluck. At the same time, glam was hardly immune to the vexing, and often contradictory, sexual mores of its day.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/15/transformer-by-simon-doonan-review-a-walk-on-the-wild-side">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Swedish writer offers an audacious, gripping novel imagining the poet’s final year and the conflict between creative genius and domestic life</p><p>“Oh, he is here; my black marauder; oh hungry hungry,” Sylvia Plath wrote in her diary, half longing for and half fearing the return of Ted Hughes in 1956. Both poets used each other as material and fuel for incandescent, mythological writing. To write about their marriage is therefore dangerous – you’re competing with two of the greatest 20th-century poets. But it’s seductive nonetheless, and perhaps especially for novelists, because it’s such a novelistic story: two writers locked in a life-and-death struggle in a remote house; a mistress invited into the household by Plath herself, in a gesture at once self-destructive and unknowing.</p><p>Euphoria,<em> </em>a much-garlanded novel by Swedish writer Elin Cullhed, is an account of Plath’s final year, flooded with Plath’s own imagery and written from a perspective deep inside her head. There’s a massive audacity to it. Effectively Cullhed tries to do in more capacious, domestic and worldly form what Plath succeeded so spectacularly in doing in her final poems – writing all the pleasure and pain of maternal and sexual love in a world at once ordinary (baking, gardening, sleeping children) and feverishly charged. Think of <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49006/nick-and-the-candlestick" title="">the poem Nick and the Candlestick</a>, in which Plath, walking with a candlestick to her son’s bedroom, becomes a miner alongside “waxy stalactites”, the baby’s room a womb exuding “black bat airs”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/15/euphoria-by-elin-cullhed-review-inside-the-mind-of-sylvia-plath">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As I drove away from Winchester service station, I realised a long-planned campaign was being put into action</p><ul><li>What was the image on your phone that defined 2022? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/snapshot-of-2022">Writers give their perspectives</a></li></ul><p>I learned the Queen was gravely ill while travelling on a train in Germany. It was several hours before the official announcement of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/08/queen-elizabeth-ii-britains-longest-reigning-monarch-dies-aged-96">her death</a>; at this point, doctors were “concerned” for her health. But the image of a BBC newsreader in black tie and jacket gave the game away. This was the moment that the national broadcaster had been nervously rehearsing for decades. Strict protocols were in place to ensure no embarrassments. If the BBC had gone to black tie, I thought, Her Majesty must have already passed.<br /><br />By the time I reached my gig that evening, the announcement had been made. I sat up late into the night, watching reactions to the news on TV. Flying home the next day, I wasn’t sure what to expect. Would people be sombre or shocked? Flags flew at half-mast, but Heathrow was as bustling as ever and, driving home to Dorset, things looked pretty much as they always did.<br /><br />Stopping for coffee at Winchester services on the M3, I got my first taste of the mood that would come to dominate the following days. Either side of the entrance to the food hall, the video billboards that usually advertised the delights available within now showed a portrait of the Queen, alternating with her royal cypher and her dates, 1926-2022. I took a photo and sent it to my brother-in-law. I found it hard not to see it as a crass attempt by advertising companies to jump on the bandwagon of national grieving. As I drove on into the night, a long-planned campaign was being put into action, its aim to ensure that we all participated in mourning the loss of the Queen.<br /><br />What to make of patriotism? To paraphrase Martin Luther King, the arc of history is long, but it bends towards inclusivity. It’s why corporations believe they can reach a younger demographic by commissioning ads that celebrate diversity, why the National Trust seeks to highlight the connection between slavery and stately homes, and why there is a plus sign at the end of LGBTQ.<br /><br />Patriotism chafes against this trend. Resistant to change, reliant on conformity, it takes pride in immutable symbols and institutions, such as the flag and the armed forces, and prizes assimilation over diversity. While inclusivity presents as an invitation, patriotism is at best an expectation and at worse a demand. Are you with us or against us?<br /><br />I found it hard to disentangle the period of official solemnity from the politics of this country over the past decade. This was a time when those who seemed determined to offend were elevated to the highest offices in the land, using dog-whistles to stir up division. Attempts to have a deeper understanding of our colonial past were met with outrage and reaction. Millions were put through privation and economic hardship. The flag was waved by our politicians more and more, making it mean less and less. Britain became ever more inhospitable to those who choose to make their homes here.</p><p>The two dark sentinels standing guard at Winchester on that September night seemed to silently insist that, before entering, we bow our heads in respect of a version of our national story – but who decides on that story? And where is it going?<br /><br />For those on the outside looking in, it will take more than the coronation of a new king to bring the country together. In order to feel that they belong, people need to see themselves as part of the national narrative and feel that their experiences are being treated with respect. That is simply not achievable at a time when politics rewards those bent on exclusion.</p><p>Billy Bragg is a singer-songwriter and activist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/15/mourning-queen-billboards-winchester">Continue reading...</a>

## Dismantling Sellafield: the epic task of shutting down a nuclear site

<p>Nothing is produced at Sellafield anymore. But making safe what is left behind is an almost unimaginably expensive and complex task that requires us to think not on a human timescale, but a planetary one</p><p>If you take the cosmic view of Sellafield, the superannuated nuclear facility in north-west England, its story began long before the Earth took shape. About 9bn years ago, tens of thousands of giant stars ran out of fuel, collapsed upon themselves, and then exploded. The sheer force of these supernova detonations mashed together the matter in the stars’ cores, turning lighter elements like iron into heavier ones like uranium. Flung out by such explosions, trillions of tonnes of uranium traversed the cold universe and wound up near our slowly materialising solar system.</p><p>And here, over roughly 20m years, the uranium and other bits of space dust and debris cohered to form our planet in such a way that the violent tectonics of the young Earth pushed the uranium not towards its hot core but up into the folds of its crust. Within reach, so to speak, of the humans who eventually came along circa 300,000BC, and who mined the uranium beginning in the 1500s, learned about its radioactivity in 1896 and started feeding it into their nuclear reactors 70-odd years ago, making electricity that could be relayed to their houses to run toasters and light up Christmas trees.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/15/dismantling-sellafield-epic-task-shutting-down-decomissioned-nuclear-site">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This winter’s wave of strikes isn’t just a protest at poor pay,<strong> </strong>but at a broken economic and political system</p><p>A strike can be caused by many different things, but all strikes are the result of societal or economic failure. The failure can be at the micro level – a lack of agreement between management and workforce about what can be afforded, for instance. But the failure can also be at the macro level – government policy that pushes businesses and workers to the limit, inadequacy of the dominant ideas of political economy to cope with changing times and new concerns, or even a failure of the collective imagination of an era or culture.</p><p>So, when the UK is hit, as this December, by strikes involving nurses, teachers and lawyers, along with postal, rail and energy workers, there is plenty of micro failure in individual industries to go round. But since the UK is also recording its highest number of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/dec/13/uk-rail-train-strikes-real-wages-unemployment-ons-rmt-network-rail-cancellations-strike-business-live#:~:text=The%20UK%20recorded%20the%20highest,(ONS)%20reported%20on%20Tuesday.">days lost through strikes</a> for more than a decade, with those figures certain to rise again over the next quarter, the failure is simultaneously macro – and on a substantial, even historic, scale.
