In 2010, then-President Barack Obama announced that the non-Orion bits of Constellation were being axed and simultaneously called for $6 billion in additional funding as well as the development of a new heavy lift rocket program with a goal of putting humans on Mars by the mid-2030s. This became the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/649377main_PL_111-267.pdf\">NASA Authorization Act of 2010</a> and formally kicked off development of the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/index.html\">Space Launch System</a>, the most powerful rocket NASA has built to date.</p><p>The Artemis program was helped further in December of 2017 when former President Donald Trump signed <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/new-space-policy-directive-calls-for-human-expansion-across-solar-system\">Space Policy Directive 1</a> (SPD 1). That policy change, \u201cprovides for a US-led, integrated program with private sector partners for a human return to the moon, followed by missions to Mars and beyond\u201d and authorized the campaign that would become Artemis two years later. In 2019, then-Vice President Mike Pence announced that the program\u2019s goals were accelerating, the moon landing goal pushed up four years to 2024 though its original goal of Mars in the 2030s remained unchanged.</p><p>\u201cThe directive I am signing today will refocus America\u2019s space program on human exploration and discovery,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cIt marks a first step in returning American astronauts to the moon for the first time since 1972, for long-term exploration and use.

The moon, for all its tide-inducing benefits here on Earth, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-19-nasa-astronaut-health-deep-space-missions.html\">is generally inhospitable to life</a>, what with its general lack of breathable atmosphere and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nasas-first-lunar-rover-will-scour-the-moons-south-pole-for-water-in-2023-160022034-170003713.html\">liquid water</a>, weak gravity, massive temperature swings and <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/glenn/2021/dust-an-out-of-this-world-problem/\">razor-sharp, statically-charged dust</a>.

But high-risk, high-reward logistical nightmares are kind of NASA\u2019s whole deal.</p><p>As such, the Artemis program is split between the SLS missions, which will eventually bring the human crew to the moon, and the support missions, which will bring everything else. That includes robotic rovers, the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/about-human-landing-systems-development\">Human Landing System</a>, as well as moonbase and <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/gateway\">Gateway</a> components along with all of the logistical support and infrastructure that they will require.</p><h2>Artemis SLS missions</h2><p>The SLS missions are built around NASA\u2019s new <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/2018_esd_factsheet_v6tagged.pdf\">Deep Space Exploration System</a>, which comprises the SLS super heavy-lift launch vehicle, the Orion Spacecraft and the Exploration Ground Systems at Kennedy Space Center (KSC).</p><figure><img alt=\"Artemis 1 moon sequence\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/b3efeaa0-7666-11ed-93f7-3ec3568835fe\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">NASA</div></figure><h3>NASA\u2019s deep space exploration system</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/index.html\">Space Launch System</a> is the single most powerful rocket humanity has built and, given its modular, evolvable design, will likely continue to be for the foreseeable future. Its initial configuration, dubbed <a href=\"https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/constellation/SLS_AtAGlance_NP-2015-09-83-MSFC.pdf\">Block 1</a>, consists of just the core stage with four <a href=\"https://www.rocket.com/space/liquid-engines/rs-25-engine\">RS-25 engines</a> and two, five-segment solid rocket boosters. Once the SLS breaks atmosphere, its <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/fs/ICPS.html\">Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage</a> takes over for in-space propulsion.</p><p>Those RS-25\u2019s are the same engines that flew on the Space Shuttle. Aerojet Rocketdyne of Sacramento, California is updating and upgrading 16 of them for use in the modern era \u2014 bringing them up to standard for use with the SLS \u2014 with a new engine controller, new nozzle insulation, and 512,000 pounds of thrust. Altogether, the core stage will produce 8.8 million pounds of thrust and be capable of pushing 27 metric tons (22,000 sqft) of cargo out to the moon at speeds in excess of 24,500 miles per hour. The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/watch-nasas-latest-artemis-1-launch-attempt-here-020044428.html\">Artemis 1 mission that launched in November</a>, as well as the next two Artemis missions, are slash will be powered by Block 1 rockets.</p><figure><img alt=\"SLS Block builds\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/cacc1eb0-7666-11ed-bfef-c0177963d722\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">NASA</div></figure><p>Block 1B rockets will include an Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) built by Boeing and composed of \u201cfour RL10C-3 engines that produce almost four times more thrust than the one RL10B-2 engine that powers the ICPS,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/fs/sls.html\">per NASA</a>. That additional engine will enable the space agency to haul 38 tons of cargo out of Earth\u2019s gravity well. This updated block will provide NASA a bit more flexibility in its launches. A 1B rocket can be configured to lift the Orion spacecraft or cargo loads into deep space as easily as it can be for hauling large cargoes to the moon or Mars. NASA plans to lift unwieldy portions of the moonbase and Gateway into space with it.</p><p>The SLS\u2019 final form (for now) will be Block 2. Standing more than 30 stories tall, weighing the equivalent of 10 fully-loaded 747\u2019s, the block 2 blasting 9.2 million pounds of thrust (20 percent more than the Saturn V) to push 46 metric tons of stuff (taking up as much as 54,000 square feet) into deep space. Once that configuration comes online, NASA expects it to take on much of the heavy lifting (sorry not sorry) in delivering crews and cargo to the moon.</p><h3>Orion spacecraft</h3><p></p><div id=\"d65b989872e04807bdcbf4cb6848fdb5\"></div><p>Riding atop the SLS\u2019s multi-ton controlled explosions is the Orion Spacecraft, the first crew capsule designed for deep space exploration in more than a generation. Designed and built with help from the ESA, the Orion sandwiches a four-person crew cabin in between a services module that holds all of the important life support, navigation and propulsion systems, and a <a href=\"https://www.northropgrumman.com/space/keeping-astronauts-safe-with-nasas-orion-spacecrafts-launch-abort-system/\">Launch Abort System</a> (LAS) that will forcibly eject the crew capsule from the larger launch vehicle if a catastrophic failure occurs during takeoff.</p><p>The 50-foot tall LAS weighs 16,000 pounds and is designed to engage within milliseconds of a launch going sideways, lifting the crew cabin away from the rest of the SLS at Mach 1.2 using the 400,000 pounds of thrust produced by the abort motor. Its attitude control motor provides another 7,000 pounds of thrust to keep the capsule upright during escape while the jettison motor will separate the LAS from the cabin once clear, the latter deploying a parachute ahead of its upcoming water landing.</p><p>The LAS actually predates Orion by four years. The LAS was first integrated into a Delta IV and flown at the White Sands test facility in New Mexico in 2010 while the (uncrewed) Orion <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_Flight_Test-1\">Exploration Flight Test-1</a> didn\u2019t take off for its four-hour, two orbit jaunt until 2014.</p><p>The Orion main cabin is just under 16 feet tall and just over 16 feet in diameter. Its four wing solar array produces 11kW of power and the attached service module holds enough air and water to keep the crew alive, if a bit panicked and sir-crazy, for up to three weeks.</p><h3>Exploration ground systems</h3><figure><img alt=\"CAPE CANAVERAL, FL - NOVEMBER 3: In this handout photo provided by NASA, NASAs Space Launch System (SLS) rocket with the Orion spacecraft aboard is seen atop the mobile launcher as Crawler Transporter-2 (CT-2) begins to climb the ramp at Launch Pad 39B at NASAs Kennedy Space Center on November 3, 2022 in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

While in orbit, the Capstone will communicate and coordinate some of its maneuvers with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-18-lunar-orbiter-earthrise.html\">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> which has been circling the moon since 2009.</p><p>In 2023, NASA also plans to launch the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nasas-first-lunar-rover-will-scour-the-moons-south-pole-for-water-in-2023-160022034-170003713.html\">VIPER robotic rover</a> to the moon\u2019s South Pole where it will search the lowest, darkest, coldest craters for accessible water ice. Finding a source for H2O is of paramount importance to the long-term viability of the colony. In space, water isn\u2019t just for drinking and bathing \u2014 it can be split into its component atoms and used to fuel our oxidizing rockets, potentially turning the Moon into an orbital gas station as we push farther out from Earth. The rover, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HERACLES_(spacecraft)\">others like it</a>, will be delivered to the surface as part of NASA\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Lunar_Payload_Services\">Commercial Lunar Payload Services</a> (CLPS) program.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until the mid 1990s that NASA even <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/lro-lunar-hydrogen\">confirmed the presence of water ice on the moon</a> and only two years ago did they <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-sofia-discovers-water-on-sunlit-surface-of-moon\">discovered ice accessible from the moon\u2019s surface</a>. \u201cWe had indications that H2O \u2013 the familiar water we know \u2013 might be present on the sunlit side of the moon,\u201d Paul Hertz, director of the Astrophysics Division in the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters, <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-sofia-discovers-water-on-sunlit-surface-of-moon\">said at the time</a>. \u201cNow we know it is there. This discovery challenges our understanding of the lunar surface and raises intriguing questions about resources relevant for deep space exploration.\u201d</p><p>Similarly, any habitat established on the surface will need an ample supply of electricity to remain online. Solar charging is one obvious choice (that lack of atmosphere is finally coming in handy) but NASA has never been one to underprepare and has already <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nasa-doe-nuclear-fission-system-moon-contracts-190515915.html\">selected three aerospace companies to develop nuclear power sources</a> for potential deployment.</p><h2>Gateway</h2><figure><img alt=\"Gateway components blowup\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/0ea58130-7667-11ed-9cf3-e20225ac4d4c\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">NASA</div></figure><p>In addition to a surface installation, NASA plans on putting a full-fledged space station, dubbed the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/gateway/overview\">Lunar Gateway</a>, into orbit around the moon where it will serve much the same purpose as the ISS does today. Visiting researchers will stay aboard the pressurized Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) module where they\u2019ll have access to research facilities, remote rover controls and docking for both Orion capsules from Earth and HLS (Human Landing System<strong>)</strong> landers to the moon\u2019s surface. A 60kW solar plant will provide power to the station, which also serves as a communications relay hub with the planet. The station\u2019s position around the moon will also provide a unique astronomical perspective for future research.</p><p>The Gateway will very much be an international operation. As NASA points out, Canada\u2019s CSA is providing \u201cadvanced robotics\u201d for use upon the station, the ESA is supplying a second living module called the International Habitat (IHab) as well as the ESPRIT communications module and an array of research cubesats. Japan\u2019s JAXA will kick in additional habitat components and assist with resupply logistics.</p><h2>Human Landing System and rovers</h2><p>From the Gateway, astronauts and researchers will ferry down to the moon\u2019s surface to collect samples, run experiments and conduct observations aboard the Human Landing System, a reusable lunar lander program currently being operated out of Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.</p><p>NASA selected SpaceX\u2019s Starship for its initial landing system in April 2021, awarding the company $2.9 billion to further the vehicle\u2019s development. The agency then awarded SpaceX with another $1.15 billion this past November as part of the Option B contract modification. The extra money will help fund planned upgrades to the spacecraft, which is being modified from the base Starship design for use on and around the moon\u2019s surface.</p><p>\u201cContinuing our collaborative efforts with SpaceX through Option B furthers our resilient plans for regular crewed transportation to the lunar surface and establishing a long-term human presence under Artemis,\u201d Lisa Watson-Morgan, NASA HLS program manager, <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/nasa-awards-spacex-1-15-billion-contract-for-second-artemis-lander-mission/\">said in November</a>. \u201cThis critical work will help us focus on the development of sustainable, service-based lunar landers anchored to NASA\u2019s requirements for regularly recurring missions to the lunar surface.\u201d</p><div id=\"103420456e0b4931bb81f6f5d7edebb6\"></div><p>Researchers, however, will not be content to travel nearly a quarter million miles just to set down on the moon and look out the lander\u2019s windows. Instead, they\u2019ll be free to wander around the surface safely ensconced in spacewalk equipment supplied by Axiom Space and Collins Aerospace.</p><p>\u201cWith these awards, NASA and our partners will develop advanced, reliable spacesuits that allow humans to explore the cosmos unlike ever before,\u201d said Vanessa Wyche, director of NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston, <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-partners-with-industry-for-new-spacewalking-moonwalking-services\">said in June</a>. \u201cBy partnering with industry, we are efficiently advancing the necessary technology to keep Americans on a path of successful discovery on the International Space Station and as we set our sights on exploring the lunar surface.\u201d</p><p>Those researchers won\u2019t be on foot either. Just as the Apollo astronauts famously bounced around on NASA\u2019s first-gen lunar rovers, the Artemis missions will use new <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-makes-progress-with-new-lunar-terrain-vehicle-moon-rover-services\">Lunar Terrain Vehicles</a>. The unpressurized buggies are currently still in development but NASA expects to have a finalized proposal ready by next year and have the LTVs ready for surface service by 2028.</p><h2>The Artemis Base Camp</h2><div id=\"0ee2aba8f0f34e28960ac2294815177a\"></div><p>When not in use, the LTVs will be parked at NASA\u2019s Artemis Base Camp at the lunar South Pole, alongside a pressurized version designed for longer-duration expeditions. The surface habitat itself will be able to support up to four residents at a time and provide communications, equipment storage, power and, most importantly, robust radiation shielding (and there\u2019s the downside of not having an atmosphere). A site hasn\u2019t yet been officially selected, though mission planners are looking for areas near the region\u2019s permanently shadowed craters where water ice is expected to be most easily accessible (aside from the negative 280 degree temperatures and perpetual darkness).</p><p>\u201cOn each new trip, astronauts are going to have an increasing level of comfort with the capabilities to explore and study more of the moon than ever before,\u201d Kathy Lueders, associate administrator for human spaceflight at NASA Headquarters, <a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2020/10/28/lunar-living-nasas-artemis-base-camp-concept/#:~:text=NASA%20will%20build%20on%20the,and%20even%20a%20mobile%20home.\">said in 2020</a>. \u201cWith more demand for access to the moon, we are developing the technologies to achieve an unprecedented human and robotic presence 240,000 miles from home.

Headsets have come a long way since the launch of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive six years ago. The Meta Quest 2 has already been around for two years, and it\u2019s proven to be a very capable portable VR experience. And if you\u2019re looking for a more immersive experience, high-end PC headsets are getting cheaper (and there\u2019s the new PS VR 2 to look forward to). While the overall VR market hasn\u2019t really changed much since last year (aside from the somewhat disappointing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-pro-review-a-next-gen-headset-for-the-vr-faithful-specs-price-130045313.html\">Meta Quet Pro</a>), at least there are plenty of VR experiences to dive into.</p><h2>So what makes a good VR headset?</h2><p>I tend to judge them on a few basic criteria: Ergonomics, immersion and controls. It's not that hard to shove a mobile display into a plastic headset and strap some cheap elastic headbands onto it. But it takes skill to craft something that's well balanced and doesn't feel uncomfortable after 30 minutes.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Immersion, meanwhile, comes from having high resolution screens with fast refresh rates, so everything looks sharp and smooth. Field of view is also a major element, as it describes how well VR screens can cover what you see. Having a low field of view makes it feel like you\u2019re looking through a pair of binoculars, which limits your sense of \u201cpresence.\u201d But a wide field of view can make it seem like you\u2019re actually flying over the globe in Google</p><p>Earth.</p><p>And when it comes to controllers, the best options fit naturally in your hands and offer accurate tracking. The industry has basically adopted the design of Meta\u2019s excellent touch controllers, but we're also seeing intriguing leaps forward like Valve's finger tracking gamepads.</p><h2>Best VR headset for most people: Meta Quest 2</h2><p></p><p>Over two years since its release, the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PY3VsdXMtUXVlc3QtQWR2YW5jZWQtQWxsLU9uZS1WaXJ0dWFsL2RwL0IwOTlWTVQ4Vlo_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg1ZmYzNGJmLWY2ZjctNDg3OC04MGMxLTVmMTU1ZTdhZjE0YiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQFeq6Fas1jV9ohaGomag8_kstKpjjQIA8yViHmVHwnB&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual%2Fdp%2FB099VMT8VZ\">Meta Quest 2</a> remains the best VR option for the vast majority of consumers. It's completely cordless, and it's comfortable to wear for long sessions. Unfortunately, due to supply chain pressures and a worsening economic climate, Meta ended up increasing the Quest 2\u2019s price by $100 this year, making it a $400 headset. It\u2019s still a great device, but it\u2019s also in the strange position of being a worse deal than it was last year.</p><p>Here\u2019s what\u2019s still good, though: there's a huge library of titles that you can experience anywhere, and it's bundled with Meta\u2019s great motion controllers. You can also connect the Quest 2 to a gaming PC to stream more complex VR experiences.</p><p>The Quest 2 features fast-switching LCDs with a resolution 1832x1920 per eye, the highest we've seen from Meta. It also has a smooth 90Hz refresh rate, which is impressive for something running entirely on mobile hardware. The Quest 2's field of view isn't the best \u2014 it's been measured at just around 90 degrees \u2014 but it's still enough to enjoy most VR experiences. You can also <a href=\"https://www.vrfitnessinsider.com/i-boosted-my-quest-2s-field-of-view-halfway-to-a-valve-index-vrcover-foam-pads-fov-rated/\">use different face pads</a> to increase its field of view a bit.

(At least until we see a potential follow-up next year.)</p><h2>Best PC VR headset under $600: HP Reverb G2</h2><p></p><p>If you don't care about wireless VR, and you want to invest a bit more in a high-quality PC headset, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9IZWFkc2V0LUNvbnRyb2xsZXItQWRqdXN0YWJsZS1TcGVha2Vycy1Fcmdvbm9taWMtQ29tcGF0aWJsZS9kcC9CMDhUQjVKN0tZP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWRjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NWZmMzRiZi1mNmY3LTQ4NzgtODBjMS01ZjE1NWU3YWYxNGIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAU8yuwb4LPkC9aq-FwtzTfc5m5cydhv9-Jh3N1rWGM-5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHeadset-Controller-Adjustable-Speakers-Ergonomic-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB08TB5J7KY\">HP's $599 Reverb G2</a> is meant for you. It was developed in cooperation with Valve and has some of the best features from the pricier Index headset, like near-field speakers. The Reverb G2 also has sharp screens, offering 2,160 by 2,160 pixels per eye, a 90Hz refresh rate, and a relatively wide 114-degree field of view.</p><p>It's also the first Windows Mixed Reality headset to include four sensors, which helps to ensure more accurate VR tracking, especially during fast-paced games. I also give HP credit for making a headset that\u2019s extremely comfortable thanks to its luxurious cushioning around the eye-piece and rear strap.</p><p>The Reverb G2's motion controllers aren't my favorite, but they're still a big step up from HP's previous model. You could also upgrade it to use Valve's finger-tracking controllers, but that involves snagging SteamVR sensors and a lot more setup. Still, it's nice to have the upgrade path available.</p><h2>Best PC VR headset for gamers: Valve Index</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex\">Valve's Index kit</a> remains one of the best high-end VR solutions on the market. For $999 you get the Index headset, Valve's finger tracking controllers and two SteamVR base stations. While we've seen higher-resolution headsets arrive in the last two years, it's still a very solid option, with a 1,440 by 1,600 pixel resolution, an eye-watering 144Hz refresh rate and a massive 130-degree field of view. I'd gladly lose a few pixels to get a smoother and more expansive screen, which are still far beyond any other consumer headset.</p><p>As a SteamVR product, the Index requires installing two sensors at opposite corners of your room. And of course, it's wired to your PC. But that clunkiness is worth it for the higher refresh rate and more accurate tracking. Sure, it's not as easy to use as the Quest 2, but at this price range, we assume you'll suffer a bit of inconvenience to get a truly high-quality VR experience.</p><p>Valve's finger tracking controllers are fantastic as well, with a convenient strap that locks them onto your hands. They make playing <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> feel like a dream. It's unfortunate that other VR games haven't fully taken advantage of the finger tracking though.</p><h2>Best VR quality, no matter the cost: HTC Vive Pro 2</h2><p></p><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlGUENUM0g4Lz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1kYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODVmZjM0YmYtZjZmNy00ODc4LTgwYzEtNWYxNTVlN2FmMTRiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAbIfFJwh94FAXF8dh3EuNAtYS0hhu_zdCTW83DVKM95B&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09FPCT3H8%2F\">HTC's Vive Pro 2</a> is the best-looking PC VR I've seen. It has an astoundingly sharp 5K screen and a solid 120Hz refresh rate. Just be prepared: the full kit, which includes the headset, two SteamVR sensors and wand controllers, costs $1,399.

I'm less impressed with the large wand controllers, which are exactly the same as the ones that came with the original HTC Vive in 2016. They're functional, but they're nowhere near as ergonomic as Oculus's Touch Controllers.</p><p>I'm mainly recommending the Pro 2 here based on the astounding quality of the headset.</p><p>True VR fans may want to just grab that separately along with SteamVR base stations and Valve's finger-tracking controllers. That way you can ensure you have the best experience while playing <em>Pistol Whip</em>.<em>.</em></p><h2>What about the PS VR 2?</h2><p>We adored <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-05-sony-playstation-vr-review.html\">Sony\u2019s PlayStation VR</a> when it launched, but it\u2019s practically been ignored since the PlayStation 5 debuted. Sony\u2019s solution is the PS VR 2, a completely revamped device with built-in tracking, far better resolution, a larger field of view, and support for 120Hz refresh rates. It also sports brand new controllers with haptic feedback, so you can finally throw away those old PS Move wands.

Amazon, one of the Alliance's other founders, also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-device-matter-support-compatibility-141558771.html\">listed the 17 Echo devices</a> that will support the standard starting this month.&nbsp;</p><p>While very <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/matter-smart-home-devices-eve-update-163158992.html\">few products are Matter-enabled</a> at the moment, Google says you'll see more come out these holidays and in early 2023.

It felt like a breath of fresh air compared to ultraportables that trade repairability for thinness. This year, Dell is pushing the concept even further. Its latest Luna device can be fully disassembled in around 30 seconds using just a push-pin tool and a bit of elbow grease. There aren't any cables or screws to worry about.</p><div id=\"0b62f7a4224642eaa1eee1d8b5158482\"></div><p>How can Dell achieve this sorcery? By developing a completely modular design, wherein every component can be snapped into place without much fuss. And it's not just marketing hype: As you can see in the video above, it doesn't take much effort for a Dell representative to deftly disassemble a Luna device. After unlocking the keyboard with a pin tool, he removed two speaker units, the battery, a CPU fan and a slim motherboard. The display was a cinch to remove as well, after unlocking the laptop's center bezel.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>When it's all put together, the new Concept Luna looks like one of Dell's 13-inch laptops (more a Latitude than a slim XPS, to be clear). You'd have no idea there was a genuine revolution going on under the hood. Dell's sustainability angle is a lot more clear this time around. Whereas the previous concept still required a bit of technical maneuvering, it wouldn't take much for a general user to get under the hood of a fully modular laptop like this. It's about as hard as ejecting a SIM card.</p><figure><img alt=\"Someone disassembling a Dell Concept Luna laptop.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/b2c4b130-7c31-11ed-8bff-01ee2f1126bd\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Dell</div></figure><p>The new Luna laptop also has room for a CPU fan, allowing it to house more powerful processors. Additionally, Dell worked with a micro-factory while developing Luna, allowing the company to automate the ordeal of assembling and tearing Luna devices apart. That process also involves testing individual components \u2014 after all, it's easy to imagine some aspects of a computer getting far more use than others. If you primarily used your laptop on a desk with an external keyboard, its built-in keyboard probably has a lot of life left.</p><figure><img alt=\"A robot disassembling a Dell Concept Luna laptop.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/b2c5e9b0-7c31-11ed-afde-26f7bb764871\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Dell</div></figure><p>&quot;By marrying Luna\u2019s sustainable design with intelligent telemetry and robotic automation, we\u2019ve created something with the potential to trigger a seismic shift in the industry and drive circularity at scale,&quot; Glen Robson, CTO for Dell Technologies\u2019 Client Solutions Group, said in a blog post. &quot;A single sustainable device is one thing, but the real opportunity is the potential impact on millions of tech devices sold each year, and optimizing the materials in those devices for future reuse, refurbishment or recycling. &quot;</p><p>While it's unlikely we'll see a Luna-like consumer laptop anytime soon, its mere existence could influence the way Dell designs future systems. The company is also pushing its sustainability initiatives in a variety of other ways, for example by dramatically reducing packaging waste, or exploring recycled materials for some PC cases. When it comes to true DIY repairability, Dell already has some <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/framework-laptop-review-150001399.html\">competition from Framework</a> (which <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/framework-modular-repairable-chromebook-review-173035156.html\">just unveiled a DIY Chromebook</a>).

There's also a 32-megapixel f/2.4 front-facing camera tucked into the top-left corner of the foldable screen. With Oppo's very own <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-x-5-pro-hands-on-110029261.html\">MariSilicon X</a> imaging neural processor, the Find N2 can also capture 4K ultra night video and 4K ultra HDR video.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/3512c3c0-7c55-11ed-b9dd-1fa0527d385f\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Oppo also unveiled the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5vcHBvLmNvbS9jbi9zbWFydHBob25lcy9zZXJpZXMtZmluZC1uL2ZpbmQtbjItZmxpcC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRhZjQzNTc2LTUxMmUtNDIyNS04YmJmLTg4NDlkNWJlOTEwZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAe8dMdmc4I7SyPtmIVhPECujR7o61sjibUFXPglKn966&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oppo.com%2Fcn%2Fsmartphones%2Fseries-find-n%2Ffind-n2-flip%2F\">Find N2 Flip</a> which, as you can tell from the name, is a direct competitor of Samsung's pocket-sized <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review-camera-samples-specs-price-battery-life-170027529.html\">Galaxy Z Flip 4</a>. The 3.26-inch external display here is apparently the \"largest cover screen in any flip\" device, which is handy for taking selfies, checking calendars and previewing messages. This device also packs the \"biggest\" battery in this form factor \u2014 4,300mAh as opposed to Samsung's 3,700mAh, along with 44W fast charging support. Chief Product Officer Pete Lau added that the Find N2 Flip supports dual SIM dual 5G standby, which is apparently also a first for a small foldable phone, thanks to the MediaTek Dimensity 9000+ processor. Like the Find N2, the 50-megapixel f/1.8 main camera, 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultra-wide camera and 32-megapixel f/2.4 front-facing camera all get the Hasselblad treatment.</p><p>The Find N2 comes in two price tiers: the 12GB RAM with 256GB storage model is asking for 7,999 yuan (around $1,150), and the more advanced 16GB RAM with 512GB storage version costs 8,999 yuan (around $1,290). As for the Find N2 Flip, it starts at 5,999 yuan ($860) with the 8GB RAM plus 256GB storage version, and it maxes out at 6,999 yuan ($1,000) with the 16GB RAM plus 512GB storage variant.</p><p>Both phones are available for pre-order in China today, ahead of the December 23rd launch for the Find N2 and then the December 30th launch for the Find N2 Flip. Oppo reps also told Engadget that the Flip will launch in international markets, but they are still evaluating whether to do the same with the bigger Find N2.</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/watch-nasa-ocean-monitoring-swot-satellite-launch-here-090048273.html?src=rss", "title": "Watch NASA's ocean-monitoring satellite launch here at 6AM ET", "date_published": "2022-12-15 09:00:48+00:00", "description": "<p>A <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/nasa/\">NASA</a> satellite launch is scheduled to take place today, but this isn't any old project.

The Ka-band Radar Interferometer (Karin) bounces signals off of two antennas on either side of SWOT.

SWOT will be able to monitor almost every river that's wider than 330 feet (100 meters) and north of a million lakes that are larger than 15 acres (62,500 square meters). All told, the satellite will survey water on 90 percent of the planet's surface.</p><p>NASA jointly developed SWOT with French space agency Centre National d\u2019Etudes Spatiales. They had help from the Canadian Space Agency and the UK Space Agency.</p><p>SWOT is scheduled to launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

Its approval emphasizes authorities' concerns that the app's China-based parent company ByteDance could share information gathered from US users with the Chinese government. Just last month, FBI Director Chris Wray <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/south-dakota-bans-tiktok-from-government-owned-devices-093526831.html\">warned</a> lawmakers that the Chinese government could use TikTok to launch &quot;influence operations&quot; or to &quot;technically compromise&quot; millions of devices.</p><p>While the bill aims to prohibit the installation of TikTok on government devices, it carves out exceptions for &quot;law enforcement activities, national security interests and activities, and security researchers,&quot; according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-15/us-senate-votes-to-ban-tiktok-app-on-government-owned-phones?sref=10lNAhZ9\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. Hawley called the app a &quot;Trojan Horse for the Chinese Communist Party&quot; and said it has no place on government devices until it completely cuts ties with China. Meanwhile, TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter told <em>Bloomberg</em> that Hawley &quot;has moved forward with... a proposal which does nothing to advance US national security interests.&quot; Oberwetter added: &quot;We hope that rather than continuing down that road, he will urge the administration to move forward on an agreement that would actually address his concerns.&quot;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Just a few days ago, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Rep.
