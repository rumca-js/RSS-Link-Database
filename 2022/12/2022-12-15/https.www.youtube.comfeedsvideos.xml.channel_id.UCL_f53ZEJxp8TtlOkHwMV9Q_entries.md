Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh

Dr Jordan B Peterson and Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris delve into the world of psychedelic research, their utility in therapy, and the impact they can have on neuroticism. They also explore broader aspects of psychopathology, brain imaging, optimized play, and the way trauma can warp our perspectives of the world.

Robin is the Ralph Metzner Distinguished Professor in Neurology and Psychiatry and Director of Neuroscape’s Psychedelics Division at the University of California, San Francisco. He moved to Imperial College London in 2008 after obtaining a PhD in Psychopharmacology from the University of Bristol. Robin has designed human brain imaging studies with LSD, psilocybin, MDMA and DMT, and several clinical trials of psilocybin therapy for severe mental illnesses. Robin founded the Centre for Psychedelic Research at Imperial College London in April 2019, was ranked among the top 31 medical scientists in 2020, and in 2021, was named in TIME magazine’s ‘100 Next’ – a list of 100 rising stars shaping the future. His research is creating system-level change in mental health care.
