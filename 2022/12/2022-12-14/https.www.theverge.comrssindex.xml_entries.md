## Google’s making code formatting a breeze in Docs

  <p id="igafVo">Google Docs is getting a new feature that will make it easier to show code in an easy-to-understand way. The <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/12/format-display-code-google-docs.html">company announced</a> that it’s adding code blocks to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/16/22935824/google-workspace-pageless-smart-canvas-ai-sheets-office-docs-sheets">its “smart canvas” system</a>, which will automatically add the proper spacing and color-coding for a variety of programming languages, such as Python, C, and Javascript.</p>
<p id="qK6dDh">Before this, getting code to look nice in Google Docs required <a href="https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/19241/how-can-i-get-code-syntax-highlighting-in-google-docs">workarounds or add-ons</a>, which weren’t necessarily the most convenient. While that wasn’t the end of the world, making sure code displays properly is important for documentation, and having different parts of the code display in different colors makes it much easier to read if there’s more than a single line or two.</p>

The show, which was first announced in February and officially titled <em>Nier: Automata Ver1.1a</em>, will begin streaming January 7th, Crunchyroll spokesperson Tyler Schirado said in an email to <em>The Verge</em>. </p>
<p id="nPd50D">Based on the official synopsis from Crunchyroll, it seems like <em>Nier: Automata Ver1.1a</em>’s<em> </em>story sticks relatively close to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/10/14875244/nier-automata-review-ps4-steam">the game</a>, though Taro said in <a href="https://youtu.be/g4_xDVQm8MY?t=219">a recent video</a> that there will be some changes.

  <p id="6KUfTm">@ElonJet, the account tracking the movements of Elon Musk’s personal jet, has been suspended from Twitter. Musk said <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1589414958508691456">in November</a> that the account was a “direct personal safety risk” but that he would not ban it as part of his “commitment to free speech.”</p>
<p id="X0EPGx">It’s not clear what changed in the month since that tweet. Posts from <a href="https://twitter.com/ElonJet">@ElonJet</a> are published to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/elonmusksjet/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElonJet/">Facebook</a>, too, and neither show the account doing anything out of the ordinary in the past few days. The account’s last posts were yesterday, showing Musk’s jet landing in Los Angeles after a 48-minute flight.</p>
<p id="P2qsIE">The ban comes less than a week after the account’s creator Jack Sweeney claimed the jet tracker <a href="https://twitter.com/JxckSweeney/status/1601793874594496512">was being quietly restricted</a> by Twitter. Sweeney posted a screenshot of an...</p>
