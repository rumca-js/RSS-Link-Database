The following morning, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Department of Justice (DOJ) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed formal civil and criminal charges against Bankman-Fried in &quot;parallel actions.&quot; It was a lot to take in all at once, so below Engadget has broken up current charges against SBF by agency, with some additional context provided.</p><p>Those indictments likely represent only the start of Bankman-Fried's troubles. In addition to the charges it announced on Tuesday, the SEC said it was investigating Bankman-Fried for other securities violations. The agency also announced that it\u2019s actively examining the actions of other FTX executives and employees. As more charges are unsealed, Engadget will continue to update this article.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>Securities and Exchange Commission</h2><h2></h2><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission accused SBF of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ftx-collapse-could-affect-more-than-one-million-investors-111742474.html\">defrauding FTX investors and customers of more than $1.9 billion</a>. Starting as early as May 2019 until as recently as this past November, &quot;Bankman-Fried was orchestrating a massive, years-long fraud, diverting billions of dollars of the trading platform's customers funds for his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire,&quot; the SEC said.</p><p>All the while, Bankman-Fried portrayed himself as a responsible business leader building a safe trading platform with &quot;sophisticated, automated measures to protect customer assets.&quot; In reality, the SEC says, &quot;Bankman-Fried orchestrated a fraud to conceal the diversion of customer funds to his privately-held crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research.&quot;</p><div id=\"35dd0a6a1cdb430b9b2ccf9552759b0c\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Today we charged FTX Trading Ltd CEO and co-founder Samuel Bankman-Fried with orchestrating a scheme to defraud equity investors.

Alameda had access to a &quot;virtually unlimited 'line of credit&quot; unknowingly funded by FTX customers. In May 2022, when Alameda's lenders demanded the firm repay loans worth billions of dollars, Bankman-Fried allegedly directed FTX to divert even more money to the hedge fund.</p><p>The SEC seeks to bar Bankman-Friend from trading securities in the future. The agency also wants to seize his ill-gotten gains and bar him from acting as an officer or director at another company.</p><p>Current FTX CEO John Ray III testified before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday \u2014<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sam-bankman-fried-congress-testify-ftx-191421723.html\"> SBF had said he would attend the hearing before his arrest</a>. Ray spoke to some of the allegations detailed by the SEC. &quot;This is really old-fashioned embezzlement,&quot; he told the panel. &quot;We've lost $8 billion. I don't trust a single piece of paper in this organization.&quot;</p><h2>Department of Justice</h2><h2></h2><p>In addition to civil charges, Bankman-Fried faces a criminal indictment from the Justice Department. On Tuesday, prosecutors from the Southern District of New York filed eight charges against the former executive, including multiple counts of wire fraud. The Justice Department alleges SBF conspired with other individuals to defraud investors by sharing misleading information about FTX and Alameda's financial condition. Prosecutors further accused him of attempting to commit commodities and securities fraud. On top of that, Bankman-Fried allegedly broke federal election laws by donating more than is legally allowed and in the names of other people.</p><div id=\"642deac6702447fa9ac5c9a3bae42402\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Watch today's complete FTX hearing with CEO John Ray re-airing at 8pm ET on C-SPAN or anytime online here: <a href=\"https://t.co/UZeZcu93mc\">https://t.co/UZeZcu93mc</a><a href=\"https://t.co/qmLfR1VWiN\">pic.twitter.com/qmLfR1VWiN</a></p>\u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1602825950365827072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 14, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>SBF spoke about his political donations in a recent <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6DezodR9hNI\">interview with journalist Tiffany Fong</a>. &quot;I donated to both parties.

The reason was not for regulatory reasons, it's because reporters freak the fuck out if you donate to Republicans.&quot;</p><p>It's worth emphasizing how serious the criminal charges against Bankman-Fried are. For context, a federal judge recently sentenced Theranos founder and former CEO Elizabeth Holmes to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-fraud-sentence-221816950.html\">11 years in prison</a> for defrauding the company's investors and patients.

Sam Bankman-Fried stands accused of defrauding investors of almost $2 billion, or about twice what investors lost to Theranos.</p><h2>Commodity Futures Trading Commission</h2><h2></h2><p>Rounding out the current charges against Bankman-Fried, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission accused the former executive of using Alameda Research to &quot;surreptitiously&quot; siphon customer funds. &quot;At Bankman-Fried's direction, FTX executives created features in the underlying code for FTX that allowed Alameda to maintain an essentially unlimited line of credit on FTX,&quot; the regulator alleges. It adds that Alameda had other &quot;unfair&quot; advantages, including an exemption from the platform's auto-liquidation risk management process.</p><div id=\"52e37cdaf5714420a3869d5501d03754\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AOC</a> (D-NY) questions new FTX CEO John Ray on timing of Sam Bankman-Fried's arrest by the Bahamian government. <a href=\"https://t.co/2foxUpsitR\">pic.twitter.com/2foxUpsitR</a></p>\u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1602736985172430849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 13, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>As early as May 2019, SBF and &quot;at least one&quot; other Alameda executive directed the firm to use FTX customer funds to trade on competing platforms and buy &quot;high-risk&quot; digital assets.

So, for example, a 7.5-mile trip taking 30 minutes would earn a driver at least $27.15 \u2014 $2.50 higher than the current rate.

It also claims the TLC\u2019s hikes use flimsy calculations to lock in temporarily inflated gas prices. \u201cSuch a significant fare hike, right before the holidays, would irreparably damage Uber\u2019s reputation, impair goodwill and risk permanent loss of business and customers,\u201d the lawsuit said. In its response, TLC acknowledged that Uber charges 37 percent more today than in 2019, but it said the company is keeping money earned from fare hikes to itself rather than passing it on to drivers.</p><p>\u201cThis is a nasty stunt for Uber to pull on its drivers \u2014 especially right before the holidays.

Redwood Materials has <a href=\"https://www.redwoodmaterials.com/news/announcing-redwood-south-carolina/\">unveiled</a> plans to build an EV battery recycling plant on the outskirts of Charleston, South Carolina. The roughly 600-acre facility (previewed in a render above) will break &quot;end-of-life&quot; batteries down to their raw metals and rebuild them as the anodes and cathodes that are crucial to EVs. The parts should support up to 1 million EVs per year. That could not only reduce waste, but reduce the costs and risks associated with importing those components from overseas.</p><p>The plant will reportedly amount to a $3.5 billion investment that includes 1,500 jobs. Like Redwood's Nevada campus, the Charleston hub will rely solely on clean energy and all-electric operations. The company claims its approach lowers CO2 emissions for producing the battery components by about 80 percent compared to the output from the usual Asian supply chain.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Construction should start for the South Carolina plant in the first quarter of 2023. The first recycling process should be ready by the end of that year, Redwood says.

Redwood says South Carolina is part of a growing &quot;Battery Belt&quot; where EV cell manufacturing will ramp up to &quot;hundreds&quot; of gigawatt-hours of production capacity by 2030. Its seaside port helps, too. The state further hosts factories for car manufacturers that include <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bmw-i4-m50-ev-video-review-143017047.html\">BMW</a> and Redwood partner <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/copy-of-volvos-c-40-recharge-is-a-solid-second-stab-at-an-ev-163057572.html\">Volvo</a>, so a brand could quickly repurpose spent batteries for vehicles rolling off the line.</p><p>More importantly, Redwood appears to have broader support from the auto industry. On top of Volvo, it has partners like Ford, Toyota and battery makers that include Panasonic and Envision AESC. Large-scale battery recycling facilities are still relatively rare in the US \u2014 Li-Cycle's new Alabama plant <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2022/10/14/us-increases-ev-battery-recycling-capacity-with-new-al-facility/\">can process</a> batteries for about 20,000 EVs per year.

Both the iPhone and Android phones had semi-intelligent voice controls \u2014 but with the Echo, Amazon took its first step toward making something like Alexa a constant presence in your home. Since then, Apple and Google have followed suit, and now there's a huge variety of smart speakers available at various price points.</p><p>As the market exploded, the downsides of having a smart home device that's always listening for a wake word have become increasingly apparent. An unintentional voice command can activate it, sending private recordings back to monolithic companies to analyze. And even at the best of times, giving more personal information to Amazon, Apple and Google can be a questionable decision. That said, all these companies have made it easier to manage how your data is used \u2014 you can opt out of humans reviewing some of your voice queries, and it's also less complicated to manage and erase your history with various digital assistants, too.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The good news is that there's never been a better time to get a smart speaker, particularly if you're a music fan. For all their benefits, the original Amazon Echo and Google Home devices did not sound good. Sonos, on the other hand, made great sounding WiFi-connected speakers, but they lacked any voice-controlled smarts.</p><p>That's all changed now. Sonos is including both Alexa and Google Assistant support in its latest speakers. Google and Amazon, meanwhile, made massive improvements in sound quality with recent speakers. Even lower-end models like the Echo Dot and Nest Mini sound much better than earlier iterations. With the growing popularity of these speakers, there are now more options than ever. Let\u2019s walk through our choices for the best smart speakers at different price points and for different uses.</p><h2>Picking an assistant</h2><p>The first thing most people should do is decide what voice assistant they want to use. Google Assistant and Amazon's Alexa are both well-supported options that are continually evolving, with new features added at a steady clip. A few years ago, Alexa worked with more smart home devices, but at this point, basically any smart device worth buying works with both.</p><p>It's mostly a matter of personal preference. If you already use Google Assistant on your Android phone, it makes sense to stick with that. But while Alexa isn\u2019t quite as good at answering general knowledge questions, it syncs just fine with things like calendars from your Google account. And it works with perhaps the widest variety of smart home devices, as well. If you\u2019ve never used <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-alexa/id944011620\">Alexa</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.googleassistant&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US\">Google Assistant</a>, you can download their apps to your smart phone and spend some time testing them out before buying a speaker.</p><p>As for Apple, you won\u2019t be surprised to learn its HomePod mini is the only Siri-compatible speaker on the market, now that Apple has discontinued the larger HomePod. Siri has a reputation for not being as smart as Alexa or Google Assistant, but it\u2019s totally capable of handling common voice queries like answering questions, controlling smart home devices, sending messages, making calls and playing music. Technically, Siri and Apple\u2019s HomeKit technology doesn\u2019t work with as many smart home devices as the competition, but it\u2019s not hard to find compatible gear. And since the HomePod mini arrived last fall, Apple has added some handy features like a new Intercom tool. Apple is also starting to support music services besides Apple Music. Currently, Pandora is the only other option, but Apple has confirmed that Amazon Music will eventually work natively on the HomePod mini as well.</p><h2>Best smart speaker under $50: Amazon Echo Dot</h2><p></p><p>Most people's entry point into the smart speaker world will not be an expensive device. Amazon's fourth-generation <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlCOFYxTFozP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWQ2LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMmUzZjBiNy1jMTc5LTM5MmEtODIxYy1lNmRmNTNjMjgwYTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZXNEHk7FsGNE_XvtNGqcNRKg4X5smBOvwFOgWVpzaOU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09B8V1LZ3%3F\">Echo Dot</a> and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvR29vZ2xlLU5lc3QtTWluaS0ybmQtR2VuZXJhdGlvbi1DaGFsay84OTAyMjgxMTMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIyZTNmMGI3LWMxNzktMzkyYS04MjFjLWU2ZGY1M2MyODBhNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYnhLth-8PkgCeBKwGbpZ2yHt87yygEHeaFdOsatavbS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Mini-2nd-Generation-Chalk%2F890228113\">Google's Nest Mini</a> are the most obvious places to start for two important reasons. One, they're cheap: Both the Nest Mini and Echo Dost cost $50. Two, they're capable. Despite the low price, these speakers can do virtually the same things as larger and more expensive devices.</p><p>The Google Nest Mini was released in late 2019, but Amazon just refreshed the Echo Dot this year. After testing both devices, I think the Echo Dot is the best small smart speaker for most people. Amazon keeps improving the audio quality across its Echo device line, and the Echo Dot is no exception. It produces much louder and clearer audio than I\u2019d expect from a $50 speaker. The Nest Mini doesn\u2019t sound <em>bad</em>, and it\u2019s perfectly fine for listening in the bedroom while getting ready for the day, but the Echo Dot is a better all-purpose music listening device.</p><p>From a design perspective, Amazon broke the mold with the latest Echo Dot. Instead of a small puck like the Nest Mini, the new Dot is shaped like a little globe. It\u2019s much bigger than the Nest Mini, but that size gives it room for higher-end audio components. The Dot keeps the handy physical volume buttons and mute switch on top, along with a button to activate Alexa's voice control. While the Dot doesn\u2019t look as sleek as the Nest Mini, having physical buttons makes it easier to adjust volume and mute the mic. I do wish the Dot had a way to physically pause music; on the Nest Mini, if you tap the middle of the device, the music stops.</p><p>Another benefit the Amazon Echo Dot has over the Google Nest Mini is its 3.5mm audio out jack, which means you can plug it into other speakers and instantly upgrade the audio quality. When you do that, you can ask Alexa to stream music, and it'll output to whatever speaker you have connected. That'll help you get more mileage out of the Dot in the long run. The Nest Mini answers with a handy wall mount, for people who want to keep their counter or shelf clear. The Echo Dot\u2019s new bulbous form is definitely not suited to this, so if you want a speaker you can really hide, the Nest Mini is probably the better choice.</p><p>Overall, the Dot is the best choice for most people, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Nest Mini, either. I generally prefer using Google Assistant over Alexa, and anyone who feels the same should go ahead and get the Nest Mini. The Dot does sound notably better, so if you plan to listen to audio on a regular basis, that\u2019s probably the way to go. But if you only plan to use it for a quick song or podcast when you\u2019re getting ready in the morning, just pick your favorite assistant and go from there.</p><h2>Best smart speaker under $100: Amazon Echo</h2><p></p><p>Amazon, Apple and Google all have $100 smart speakers: the fourth-generation <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDg1SEs0S0w2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWQ2LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMmUzZjBiNy1jMTc5LTM5MmEtODIxYy1lNmRmNTNjMjgwYTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATdcQZxdYwTZKlKR3f8wqWL47-eHL5SKRgMmwrEYltFC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB085HK4KL6%3F\">Echo</a>, the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo+Video&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5NTI3NmYzYy03Yjc5LTRjMWUtODAzZi05ODFjZDlmN2E5NjgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmhwaG90b3ZpZGVvLmNvbS9jL3Byb2R1Y3QvMTU5ODY4NC1SRUcvYXBwbGVfYXBob21lcG1zd19ob21lcG9kX21pbmlfd2hpdGUuaHRtbD8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIyZTNmMGI3LWMxNzktMzkyYS04MjFjLWU2ZGY1M2MyODBhNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASbv34X81-BSrJYXSsOdKiAC0K4FCecA6z0vVBf_DqLL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1598684-REG%2Fapple_aphomepmsw_homepod_mini_white.html%3F\">HomePod mini</a> and the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvR29vZ2xlLU5lc3QtQXVkaW8tU21hcnQtU3BlYWtlci13aXRoLUdvb2dsZS1Bc3Npc3RhbnQtQ2hhcmNvYWwvOTQ2Nzk2MTE4IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMmUzZjBiNy1jMTc5LTM5MmEtODIxYy1lNmRmNTNjMjgwYTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcTep2X9hM-ihqguO-2qX9JKhra3B8efxxiFMhTLIAbX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Audio-Smart-Speaker-with-Google-Assistant-Charcoal%2F946796118\">Nest Audio</a>, respectively. All three companies claim superior audio quality, so for lots of people these speakers will be the sweet spot between small speakers like the Echo Dot and Nest Mini and bigger, more expensive models like the Sonos One.</p><p>Once again, Amazon punches above its weight. Like the Dot, the new Echo is totally redesigned and the new internals were made with music in mind. It combines a three-inch woofer with two 0.8-inch tweeters \u2014 a more advanced setup than either the Nest Audio or HomePod mini. (The Google Nest Audio uses a three-inch woofer but only a single 0.75-inch tweeter, while the Apple HomePod mini makes do with a single \u201cfull range\u201d driver and two passive radiators.)</p><p>In practice, this means the Echo is noticeably louder than either the Nest Audio or HomePod mini and much better suited to filling a large room than the competition. It also delivers an impressive bass thump and powerful mid-range frequencies. In fact, my main complaint with the speaker is that highs aren\u2019t quite crisp enough. Compare the Echo to a Sonos One and the One sounds much more lively, while the Echo comes off a bit muddy. Then again, the Sonos One costs twice as much as the Echo.</p><p>While the Echo may beat the Nest Audio and HomePod mini on volume and bass, Google and Apple\u2019s speakers are not bad options. The HomePod mini is the quietest of the three speakers, but it still sounds balanced across the entire audio spectrum. The bass isn\u2019t too assertive, but there\u2019s more presence than I would have expected given its tiny size (it\u2019s by far the smallest of these three speakers).</p><p>And it has a few nice perks if you\u2019re using an iPhone 11 or newer. Thanks to the U1 \u201cultra-wideband\u201d chip in recent iPhones, the HomePod mini can tell when there\u2019s a phone near it, which makes handing off music from your phone to the speaker (or vice versa) quite simple. Playback controls for the HomePod mini will automatically pop up as well, and your phone\u2019s lock screen will display music suggestions if the speaker isn\u2019t currently playing. Setup is also dead-simple \u2014 just bring an iPhone or iPad near the speaker and it\u2019ll automatically start the process.</p><p>Google\u2019s Nest Audio is also quite pleasant to listen to. It\u2019s a little louder than the HomePod mini, and has stronger bass, to boot. It doesn\u2019t have the same overall power and presence that the Echo does, but for $100 it\u2019s a well-balanced speaker that should serve most people\u2019s needs.</p><p>All three of these speakers support stereo pairing as well, if you want more volume or crave a more immersive experience. For $200, two Echoes will fill a large room with high-quality sound and enough bass to power a party. A pair of HomePod mini or Nest Audio speakers aren\u2019t quite as powerful, but it makes for a great upgrade if you\u2019re a more avid listener. A pair of Nest Audio or HomePod mini speakers sounded great on my desk during the workday. I don\u2019t need overwhelming volume but can appreciate the stereo separation. And two of those speakers together can easily power a larger living space, although the Echo is the better choice if volume is a priority.</p><p>Here too, I think that picking the assistant that works best in your house and with your other gadgets is probably the most important factor \u2014 but given Alexa\u2019s ubiquity and the new Echo\u2019s superior sound quality, I think it\u2019s the best smart speaker at this price point.</p><h2>Best midrange smart speaker: Sonos One</h2><p></p><p>If you have more than a passing interest in music, the Echo Dot and Nest Mini aren't really going to cut it. Spending more money to upgrade to a speaker designed with audio quality in mind is one of the best decisions I've made. For years, I didn't have a proper home music solution, but in the end the modest investment has made my life much more pleasant.</p><p>For a long time, my default recommendation was the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3Avb25lPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjJlM2YwYjctYzE3OS0zOTJhLTgyMWMtZTZkZjUzYzI4MGE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAco33svSsS8BfxmwqfOjkmzRvWt0QWIaXBll0Cp_bLjV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fone%3F\">$219 Sonos One</a>. It hits a sweet spot of size and convenience, and it's a huge upgrade in sound quality over the Nest Mini or Echo Dot, not to mention the larger Echo and Nest Audio. You can use either Alexa or the Google Assistant with it, and Sonos supports a huge variety of music services. But most importantly, it simply sounds great, especially if you tune the speaker to your room using the Sonos iOS app. It takes just a few minutes and makes the One sound lively, with punchy bass and clear highs.</p><p>But Amazon flipped the script in 2019 with the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDdHOVkzWk1DP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWQ2LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMmUzZjBiNy1jMTc5LTM5MmEtODIxYy1lNmRmNTNjMjgwYTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVNqK0Ur3pWwkq3FB1QhUK_SGAqMe3k4DBCBLvSfwSpl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07G9Y3ZMC\">Echo Studio</a>, a $200 Alexa-powered smart speaker that can stand up against the Sonos One. Yes, it's larger than nearly every other speaker in this guide, but the bang-for-the-buck factor is extremely high with the Echo Studio. Naturally, it's a full-fledged member of the Alexa ecosystem, which means you can do multi-room playback with other Echo speakers or set up two Studios in a stereo pair. All of Alexa's features are on board here, and it has a built-in Zigbee smart home hub, if you happen to need that.</p><p>The Echo Studio has a few other unique features for music lovers. If you sign up for Amazon's hi-def music service, you can play a (very limited) selection of songs in Sony's 360 Reality Audio format; Amazon refers to this as \"3D music.\" It may sound great, but the selection is so sparse that we can't recommend it as a reason to buy into the Echo Studio \u2014 but it will be nice as Amazon expands its catalog over time. That said, the Echo Studio\u2019s five-speaker, 360-degree design naturally provides a more 3D effect than a speaker like the Sonos One, which has a more traditional forward-firing design.</p><p>The Studio also supports Dolby Atmos, making it a candidate for a home theater setup \u2014 but it only works with Amazon's own Fire TV devices. And using a single speaker for watching movies is odd; it may sound great, but it's not the immersive experience you'll get with a dedicated soundbar and surround speakers. A stereo pair plus Amazon's Echo Sub should sound notably better, but we haven't been able to get that setup yet.</p><p>Given the quality of the Studio, the speaker shines when used with a high-def streaming service, like Amazon Music HD or Tidal's HiFi tier. The downside is that you'll pay for those \u2014 but if you want to stick with standard Spotify or Apple Music, the Studio still sounds great.</p><p>While the Studio is comparable to the Sonos One in terms of pure audio quality, the Sonos ecosystem does have a few advantages over Amazon. Sonos speakers that support voice commands, like the One, work with either Alexa or Google Assistant. So if you prefer Google, Sonos is probably the way to go. And Sonos speakers work with a much broader set of music services. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time recently comparing the One to the Echo Studio, and I go back and forth on which is superior in terms of music quality. They definitely have different profiles, and while I have come to prefer Sonos over Amazon, I know plenty of people (including my colleague Billy Steele) who find the opposite to be true.</p><p>If you have a smaller home and aren't concerned with multi-room playback, the Echo Studio should be your pick. But if you're interested in building out a multi-room setup over time, Sonos currently provides a greater variety of speakers for that mission. But either way, you'll end up with a setup that puts something like the Echo Dot or Nest Mini to shame.</p><h2>Best smart speaker for music lovers: Sonos Five</h2><p></p><p>As nice as the Echo Studio and Sonos One are, there's only so much you can get out of them. If you crave more bass, clarity and stereo separation, the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvZml2ZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjJlM2YwYjctYzE3OS0zOTJhLTgyMWMtZTZkZjUzYzI4MGE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAR25cLMb2vxNkMKEVe6NeoOcX395yZzkj30eSdpml_uG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Ffive\">Sonos Five</a> is one of our favorite pure music speakers. It has all the conveniences of the One (except for one, which we'll get to) and sounds significantly better than any other Sonos speaker. It also sounds much better than the Echo Studio and anything Google is currently selling.</p><p>That said, the Five stretches our definition of a smart speaker here because it doesn't have a built-in voice assistant. But it's so good at music playback that it's worth recommending you pick one up along with an Echo Dot or Nest Mini. Both of those speakers work with Sonos, so you can use voice commands to control the Five just as you would a dedicated Alexa or Google Assistant device. It\u2019s also easier to recommend than it was a year ago, because Sonos refreshed the speaker last spring with a new wireless radio as well as more memory and a faster processor. This means it should stay current and work with future Sonos software updates for years to come.</p><p>Since we're talking \"best\" here, I'm going to go ahead and recommend that true music junkies splash out on two Five speakers and pair them in stereo. Put simply, it's the most enjoyable experience I've had listening to music in years; I found myself picking up new details while listening to albums I've heard over and over again. It's a wonderful experience and worth saving for if you're a music lover. Put simply, I didn't know what I was missing until I tried the Five.</p><h2>Best portable smart speaker: Sonos Roam</h2><p></p><p>While many people will be happy with a few speakers strategically placed throughout their home, you might want something that works outside as well as inside. Fortunately, you can find speakers that pair voice controls and strong music playback performance with portable, weatherproof form factors. For my money, it's hard to beat the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3Avcm9hbSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjJlM2YwYjctYzE3OS0zOTJhLTgyMWMtZTZkZjUzYzI4MGE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAeq2_H9R60wVGN9EP4TrWro8mlqbdOt9_4uJX6UE_CCp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Froam\">Sonos Roam</a> for sheer versatility, not to mention audio quality.</p><p>When used inside the home, the Roam works like any other Sonos speaker. It fits in with an existing multi-room Sonos setup, or you can get a pair for stereo playback. Like most other Sonos speakers, it works with either the Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa, and it supports essentially every major music service available. It sounds very good given its tiny size; it\u2019s quieter and not quite as clear as the Sonos One, but it still packs a surprising bass thump and distinct highs.</p><p>Since it was designed with on-the-go usage in mind, the Roam has a battery and Bluetooth so you can take it anywhere and use it far away from your WiFi network. And its diminutive size makes it easy to take it everywhere, both around the house and out and about. It\u2019s also the first Sonos speaker that is fully waterproof, as well as dust- and drop-resistant, so you shouldn\u2019t worry about taking it to the pool or beach.</p><p>The Roam gets about 10 hours of battery life, whether you're on WiFI or Bluetooth. There are other portable speakers that last longer, so if you\u2019re really going to push the battery you might be better served by another option.</p><p>Sonos also has another portable option, the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvbW92ZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjJlM2YwYjctYzE3OS0zOTJhLTgyMWMtZTZkZjUzYzI4MGE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAf9M3XjMC0rhmFH7biYEPUpkOqa2PQFYcaozlglnQTbi&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fmove\">Move</a>. Like the Roam, it\u2019s a full-fledged Sonos speaker when on WiFi and works with Bluetooth when you\u2019re away from home. But it\u2019s $400 and much larger than the Roam, and even bigger than the Sonos One. This means it is very loud and has better audio quality than all the other speakers I\u2019ve mentioned, but it\u2019s not something you can toss in a bag and bring with you anywhere. When I <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-18-sonos-move-review.html\">reviewed</a> it, I liked having a speaker I could tote around the house with me and out to my porch, but the Roam does that all just as well in a much smaller package. The Move is a good option if you want a high-quality speaker for a living room with the option to occasionally drag it to the backyard.</p><p>While this guide is all about smart speakers, we'd be remiss if we didn't mention all of the solid portable speakers out there that either have limited smart features or none at all. We have an entire guide to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers-133004551.html\">best portable Bluetooth speakers</a>, and some of our favorites that support smart voice commands come from Bose.

As that title would suggest, Bose's active noise cancellation (ANC) is the main reason you'd buy this pair: It's the single most powerful ANC mode we've tested on a pair of wireless earbuds, almost totally muting low-end rumbles and muffling mid- and high-frequency sounds better than most. The earbuds automatically attune their ANC to the acoustics of your ear canals as soon as you put them on, but you can also raise or lower the intensity of the effect by creating custom listening modes in Bose's companion app.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In terms of audio quality, the QuietComfort Earbuds II have a smooth sound with a slight but noticeable bass boost. It's not world-beating like the ANC, but our review found the low-end to be richer than past Bose earbuds, and there's a graphic EQ tool in Bose's app that lets you tweak the sound more to your liking if needed.</p><p>There are a few trade-offs worth noting here. The earbuds themselves are soft and secure in the ear, but they're on the larger side, which may be fatiguing for smaller ears over time. The included charging case is similarly bulky.

The company took over Mercedes-EQ operations at the end of last season, bringing an experienced crew along to develop its first papaya-hued EV street racers. Part of that crew was team principal Ian James, who\u2019s now also managing director for McLaren Electric Racing as a whole. As the team prepares for the debut of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/formula-e-season-9-schedule-announced-183438262.html\">Formula E\u2019s Gen3</a> car in <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mclaren-formula-e-133211474.html\">Mexico City</a>, we sat down with James as well as drivers Jake Hughes and Ren\u00e9 Rast for a status update on development and the challenges ahead for Season 9.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s really helped is that the team that\u2019s been together over the past two or three seasons has largely stayed intact,\u201d James said. \u201cSo that experience that we built up, we\u2019re carrying forward into Gen3.\u201d James further explained that he hopes that level of continuity will be key to achieving the goals McLaren has set for Season 9. Due to the limited testing opportunities ahead of the first race, the team may need to rely heavily on that experience.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Teams are only permitted to conduct a handful of on-track testing sessions before the first race of the season in mid-January. Because McLaren is a customer team \u2013 they\u2019re running Nissan powertrains instead of building their own \u2013 they don\u2019t get \u201cthe privilege of doing all the test days that the regulations of the championship dictate,\u201d driver Jake Hughes explained.</p><p>Before the official preseason test this week in Valencia (six sessions across three days), Hughes and teammate Ren\u00e9 Rast have only had one proper test day, a shakedown at Bicester Heritage near McLaren HQ and a few low-power runs for media and staff. Formula E did add an additional shakedown session ahead of the official test dates this week and the championship designated a Wednesday time slot for <a href=\"https://the-race.com/formula-e/formula-e-to-hold-mock-gen3-race-on-wednesday/\"><ins>a mock race</ins></a> that will include qualifying and a test of the new ABB rapid chargers. <a href=\"https://the-race.com/formula-e/maserati-mclaren-fastest-what-happened-in-formula-e-test/\"><em><ins>The Race </ins></em><ins>reports</ins></a> that Formula E is also considering adding another session on Thursday on what was originally scheduled as a day off.</p><figure><img alt=\"McLaren Forumla E\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/b7b7b6b0-7bb9-11ed-bf2e-3fe954d85fa1\" style=\"height: 1333; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption>Rast and Hughes inspect the Gen3 car.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t actually had a lot of on-track running,\u201d Hughes continued. \u201cThe simulator has been the bulk of our work.\u201d He argued that the lack of track time won\u2019t make things more difficult for him to prepare for Gen3, even as a Formula E rookie. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be challenging no matter what \u2013 Formula E is such a difficult championship,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cI'm fully aware of the challenges I have ahead of me and I will do absolutely the best I have with what I have underneath me.\u201d</p><p>Hughes arrived in Formula E with experience in both F3 and F2, the junior series that develop talent for Formula 1. Those cars are obviously a lot different, both from a design and a powertrain standpoint. Hughes explained that the \u201cdirty air\u201d aspect of those feeder series and the difficulty with overtaking aren\u2019t part of Formula E. In most races, the races run in a train, nose to tail, and you can pass when you want \u2013 so long as you\u2019re willing to spend the extra energy to do so. So for the McLaren rookie, even though he has experience as a Formula E reserve driver, a key challenge is developing new race strategies.</p><p>\u201cStrategy is involved in every racing series around the world, but in Formula E, it\u2019s really critical,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery decision you make has a huge knock-on effect with how you use your energy later on in the race.\u201d</p><section><img alt=\"McLaren Forumla E\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/da5a7180-7bb9-11ed-a7fa-9e1ffc8ccb71\" /></section><p>Rast explained the McLaren duo had probably spent 10 days in the simulator through the end of November with more planned ahead of the Valencia test. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing we can more or less do to prepare ourselves for the car because the testing is very limited and the simulator is the closest you can get,\u201d he said. Simulated running isn\u2019t just for the drivers though, engineers and other parts of the team are also included in those sessions. That will continue throughout the season as simulator work happens before and after every race.</p><p>The team is well aware that they\u2019re likely facing \u201ca very steep learning curve\u201d when they arrive at the first E-Prix of Season 9 in Mexico City next month, according to James\u2019 assessment. \u201cI think it\u2019s the teams that deal with that in the most efficient manner are the ones that will come out on top,\u201d he continued. James specifically mentioned the new front powertrain and added regenerative abilities that will change energy management strategies, even for experienced members of the McLaren team. Aside from the updates that a more powerful Gen3 car brings, James said alterations to the race format will \u201cthrow a few curveballs in there as well.\u201d</p><p>Formula E announced changes to the races <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/formula-e-will-trial-a-30-second-quick-charging-stop-in-some-races-next-season-170257427.html\">last month</a>, getting rid of Fan Boost and replacing Attack Mode with Attack Charge at some races. The new battery technology inside the Gen3 cars allows for quick charging, but while Formula E had planned to bring back pit stops for that purpose, the infrastructure needed to do so isn\u2019t quite race-ready. And on top of the series having to switch things up pretty late in the game, the teams still aren\u2019t entirely sure how the new race format will work, which partially explains the mock race.</p><figure><img alt=\"McLaren Forumla E\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/f0e5ed80-7bb9-11ed-aff7-ade0773b010b\" style=\"height: 1333; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">McLaren</div></figure><p>\u201cObviously, Attack Mode is still the key ingredient for the race.\u201d Rast said. \u201cBut the rest we\u2019re going to see once the season starts.\u201d</p><p>James explained that the teams were able to give input on the Gen3 sporting regulations as they were developed by the FIA (Formula E\u2019s governing body). He foresees more excitement in Season 9 due to the increased flexibility in strategy the new format and guidelines will allow. So, in spite of the current unknowns, McLaren\u2019s team principal is optimistic that \u201cthe racing this year will be closer than ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to make the racing even more exciting,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be more of a challenge for the engineers, working together with the drivers to make sure that we plan in the right way before the race, but then also to react to changes and the various different situations that can arise.\u201d</p><p>And then there are the tires. Formula E is switching from a treaded Michelin tire to a custom-made compound from Hankook for Gen3. Both the old and new tires are designed to be run in both dry and wet conditions, though the Michelin compound would wear down so much on some circuits that it would basically be slick by the end of the race. Hughes explained that the Hankook version \u201cbehaves very differently,\u201d and should be more durable.</p><figure><img alt=\"McLaren Formula E\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/65151f50-7bba-11ed-9ffe-33b827356d59\" style=\"height: 1333; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption>Rast in the driver's seat.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">McLaren</div></figure><p>Still, the prospect and challenge of Formula E is as much of a thrill for the drivers as ever. With Gen3, the series has moved from having to change cars during a race to complete the distance to one that will stop for a 30-second charge. It can also hit 200MPH with a 350kW motor and is capable of regenerating 40 percent of its energy. It\u2019s the ability to show off the potential of EVs to people around the world that excites Rast.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazingly quick, it\u2019s a proper race car,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe try to bring motorsport into the cities to make people aware of what\u2019s actually possible with electrification.\u201d</p><p>Hughes agreed, noting that the potential for carryover from technology from Formula E cars to electric road cars is something he\u2019s happy to be part of. \u201cWe can basically help develop the future for electric mobility,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the stuff we\u2019re developing for Gen3 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you see it on road cars within the decade. What we\u2019re doing will have a knock-on effect that even right now we\u2019re not fully aware of.\u201d</p><p>Despite the chaos of the offseason prep and limited testing, the work McLaren has put in appears to be heading in the right direction. Hughes was second fastest across both sessions on the <a href=\"https://the-race.com/formula-e/maserati-mclaren-fastest-what-happened-in-formula-e-test/\"><ins>first day of testing in Valencia</ins></a>, less than a tenth of a second behind Masterati\u2019s Maximilian Guenther.</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m2-lowest-price-144529571.html?src=rss", "title": "Apple's MacBook Air M2 drops to a new all-time low of $999", "date_published": "2022-12-14 14:45:29+00:00", "description": "<p>Have you wanted to buy the latest MacBook Air, but didn't want to pay the premium over the M1 model?

The 8GB of RAM on these configurations is more useful than it sounds, but it might prove limiting if you routinely juggle multiple demanding apps. You won't get higher-end MacBook Pro perks like an SD card slot or a 120Hz screen, either. At this price, though, the new Air makes sense even if you occasionally need to test its limits.</p><p>And if $999 is still too much, don't fret.

Xbox Game Pass Ultimate also includes a number of other perks, including Xbox Live Gold. That's usually $10 a month on its own, and it's a requirement if you want to play games online. It also includes EA Play, which opens up access to more games for the Xbox and PC. Perhaps the best part of Xbox Game Pass, though, is that it offers access to first-party Xbox Game Studios titles the day they're released.</p><p>Sony revamped PlayStation Plus this year, combining basics like online play, cloud storage for saves and two free monthly games with a large catalog of games that can be either streamed or downloaded to your console as long as your subscription is active. There are three different tiers, all with different perks, but the middle \u201cExtra\u201d option ($100 / year, with monthly options available as well) is probably best for most gamers. It includes around 400 PS4 and PS5 games you can either stream or install on your console. You\u2019ll find high-profile titles like <em>Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, Death Stranding </em>and <em>Ghost of Tsushima </em>as well as newer games like <em>Stray </em>and <em>Returnal. </em>If you know someone who loves older games though, the \u201cPremium\u201d tier ($120 / year) adds a bunch of games from the PS1, PS2 and PS3 catalogs as well as perks like game trials.</p><p>Finally, Nintendo has two tiers of its Switch Online plan. The basic $20 / year plan unlocks online play, more than 100 NES and Super NES games and cloud backups of your saved games as well as the occasional special offers. The $50 \u201cexpansion pack\u201d adds a collection of N64 and Sega Genesis games as well as some DLC for games like <em>Mario Kart 8, Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> and <em>Splatoon 2.</em></p><h2>Apple One</h2><figure><img alt=\"Apple One\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/023a0ed0-65c7-11ed-9fdd-4482ca4a7127\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Apple</div></figure><p>If you know someone with multiple Apple devices, chances are good they\u2019re already paying for a little bit of iCloud storage, and maybe a few other Apple services like Music or Arcade as well.

It offers more than 1,000 shows as well as digital manga, merch and much more. Some of the content is available for free, but one of the three different subscriptions offers a lot more. A premium plan removes ads, unlocks access to the entire Crunchyroll library, provides access to new episodes just one hour after they air in Japan and opens up the manga collection.</p><p>The basic $8 / month tier lets you stream on one device only, but the $10 and $15 plans let you stream on four or six devices simultaneously, and they both also offer offline access, which can be crucial for watching when you\u2019re away from WiFi.</p><a class=\"athena-button\" href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/welcome\" id=\"27e7cdf946db43e4bd893a007edb507f\">Subscribe to Crunchyroll</a><h2>Twitch Turbo</h2><figure><img alt=\"Twitch Turbo\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/a56db0c0-65c7-11ed-bbbf-4e963fb074d9\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Twitch</div></figure><p>Whether you know someone who loves to stream their gaming adventures on Twitch, or they just love to watch other people play, <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/turbo\">Twitch Turbo</a> makes the whole experience better. A $9 / month subscription removes basically all advertising from Twitch, whether it\u2019s pre-roll ads, ones that pop in the middle of a stream or display ads. That\u2019ll make a Twitch binge much more enjoyable. And for those who do stream, Turbo automatically saves all of your broadcasts for 60 days instead of the standard seven, which means you have way more time to dig through your streams for highlights.</p><a class=\"athena-button\" href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/turbo\" id=\"17bb7b0edd6149cb8120bcabd2b5e8dc\">Subscribe to Twitch Turbo</a><h2>YouTube Premium</h2><figure><img alt=\"YouTube Premium\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/b268e6f0-65c7-11ed-b0ff-85c0b7e2fd1e\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p>There's something for everyone on <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS9wcmVtaXVtIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYTc1MzlmZS03ZTQyLTM4ZjEtODRjMC00NjJiODkzZmE5NmMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWNOJL_4NPr-mEFXsTFmSlDKcyefEqfMHNyvcoMCKIrV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fpremium\">YouTube</a> \u2014 and there are also enough ads to make watching it pretty painful. Shrewdly, YouTube offers a solution. A $12/month subscription removes all advertising, but there are a number of other benefits as well. If you're watching on a phone or tablet, you can download basically any video and save it for offline playback. Videos also can play in the background, which means you can switch to other apps without stopping. This comes in handy for picture-in-picture, or if you just want to hear the audio while you switch away to send a text message.</p><p>Premium also comes with a subscription to YouTube Music, the company's competitor to Spotify and Apple Music. It's a pretty solid service, and it does a few things that Apple and Spotify can't offer. For example, all of YouTube's music video content lives alongside its standard streaming catalog, which means users can build playlists that combine videos uploaded to YouTube alongside official artist releases. For $12, the combination of a better YouTube experience and a full-fledged music streaming app is a pretty good deal.</p><a class=\"athena-button rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS9wcmVtaXVtIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYTc1MzlmZS03ZTQyLTM4ZjEtODRjMC00NjJiODkzZmE5NmMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWNOJL_4NPr-mEFXsTFmSlDKcyefEqfMHNyvcoMCKIrV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fpremium\" id=\"768cb682247c4213ada2443c5b14a956\">Subscribe to YouTube Premium</a><h2>Stack magazine subscription</h2><figure><img alt=\"Stack magazine subscription\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/c0998fe0-65c7-11ed-b7b7-f1dad83f63e1\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Stack magazine</div></figure><p>Most of the recommendations on this list are for purely digital items, but there\u2019s something to be said for a tangible item, like a magazine.

Certain scenes play back at 48 frames per second, giving them a smoother and more realistic sheen compared to the standard 24 fps.

On December 5th, the researchers achieved the feat when they used 192 lasers at the National Ignition Facility to blast a cylinder containing frozen hydrogen surrounded by diamond.</p><p>The reaction, which generated a flurry of X-rays, struck a fuel pellet of deuterium and tritium with 2.05 megajoules of energy. That led to a wave of neutron particles and 3.15 megajoules of output. The gain was 'only' equivalent to about 1.5 pounds of TNT, but it was enough to meet the criteria for fusion ignition.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/first-fusion-reaction-ignition-155212785.html https://www.engadget.com/...\"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/prime-gaming-free-games-december-dishonored-2-quake-brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons-162051297.html\">Amazon Prime Gaming offers \u2018Dishonored 2\u2019 for free this month</a></h2><h3>There are a few more games, too.</h3><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/prime-gaming-free-games-december-dishonored-2-quake-brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons-162051297.html\"><figure><img alt=\"TMA\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/82d54740-7ba1-11ed-b77e-eb147e3a1d4f\" style=\"height: 377; width: 675;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Arcane</div></figure></a><p>Amazon will offer Prime Gaming members a batch of PC games later this month at no extra cost.
