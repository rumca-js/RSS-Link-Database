Upon further reflection, it's determined this happened on the streets of New York City and the video stops being shocking. It's just a Tuesday. Less surprising than the attack is the attacker is already back out on the street.</p><p>Here is the incident.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">A thug who used a baseball bat to clock a homeless person over the head in New York City was released on bail for $7,500 on Wednesday night. <a href=\"https://t.co/D73xOcQsaK\">https://t.co/D73xOcQsaK</a><br />Keep voting Democrats <a href=\"https://t.co/mgwRI4rLS4\">pic.twitter.com/mgwRI4rLS4</a><br />\u2014 Theresa Chieng (@TheresaChieng4) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheresaChieng4/status/1600872808787378178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 8, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>As you see, it was a premeditated attack. The thug walked passed the man, saw him, paused as he pulled the bat out from his pants, and cracked the guy upside the head from behind. Which shows not only is he an animal, but he's also a sucker-punching little biyatch.</p><p>A sucker-punching little biyatch, who is out and about living his best thuggish life. Prosecutors wanted $40,000. The judge, using New York's pro-criminal bail reform laws, decided on $7500 instead. The monster posted bail and is a free man.</p><p>Michael Alcazar, a professor at John Jay College, says that under New York's pro-criminal bail reform,  judges can't consider a suspect\u2019s dangerousness or the potential threat they pose.</p><blockquote>We caught him, we arrested him. We processed him, they release him. It\u2019s just insanity.</blockquote><p>At the end of the day? We had an election last month. People on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley for the second year ago voted against progressive officials who support the policies that have turned <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kathy-hochul-hillary-clinton\" target=\"_blank\">New York City</a> into a crime-infested suckhole. People in <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/queens-man-broad-daylight\" target=\"_blank\">New York City</a>, for the second year in a row, reelected them.

Then, the players fighting on the ice stopped and were distracted by a bigger brawl happening in the stands. What appears to be started by a Bruins fan and a Coyotes fan arguing over which team was better at doing hockey things, we now know ended with some dude getting his fingertip bit off.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"45fd0\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32341104&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>Here is the fight.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Insane crowd fight at the Coyotes-Bruins game last night.

And learned the hard way about attempting to break fights up.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"04483\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32327522&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>Though she took it like a champ.

Though now that I rewatch the video, it looked like he may have been thrown. That's more of a Midnight Express \"Rocket Launcher.\" Either way, when one dude does a high-cross body to take out a bunch of other dudes, that's never a good sign.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f50fb\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32327528&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>In a bygone era, a hockey fight might end with a tooth being launched into the audience. In 2022, it's a finger. I defy you to find a more accurate analogy for the unraveling of society in the modern era.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
