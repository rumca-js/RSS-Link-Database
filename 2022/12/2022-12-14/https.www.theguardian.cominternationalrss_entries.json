However, I had this strange habit as a young teenager: I avidly read French weekly <em>Le Nouvel Observateur</em>\u2019s film reviews. Once, I asked my parents for permission to go and see Godard\u2019s <em>Pierrot le Fou</em>. They said: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d I asked why. \u201cBecause it\u2019s violent,\u201d came the reply. I finally watched <em>Pierrot le Fou</em> when I studied at the national film school. The film was not violent in the way they saw it, but it was a shock, nonetheless. Little did I know then that I would spend a few years working side by side with Jean-Luc Godard.</p><p>In fact, I started gravitating towards his circle from the time I was at film school and through my 20s, thanks to the great director of photography William Lubtchansky, for whom I worked as an assistant. Lubtchansky had been the director of photography for Godard, Agn\u00e8s Varda, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Jacques Rivette, among other illustrious names of the French New Wave. They all felt ancient to me; however, they were only in their 50s and very much active. At film school, we had imbibed the New Wave; they were our masters of cinema. You had to take sides, though. There were the Rohmerian (after Eric Rohmer), the Godardian and the Truffaldian. I was a true Godardian. I was attracted to his radicalness. At the time, Godard and Truffaut had fallen out with each other, and would never patch their differences. The main distinction between Godard and the others was how he made films. Godard had his own way of writing, producing, filming and editing a film. Furthermore, unlike other film directors of his generation, he didn\u2019t believe in characters, he only believed in actors responding to his directing.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/14/obituaries-2022-jean-luc-godard-remembered-by-caroline-champetier\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/14/twitter-elon-musk-private-jet-account-suspended", "title": "Twitter suspends account that monitors flight paths of Elon Musk\u2019s private jet", "date_published": "2022-12-14 17:31:44+00:00", "description": "<p>Billionaire had vowed to allow @ElonJet to continue on free speech grounds last month after acquiring social media firm</p><p>Twitter has suspended an account that monitors the flight paths of a private jet owned by the social media giant\u2019s new boss, Elon Musk.</p><p>On Wednesday morning, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElonJet\">page</a> for the account, @ElonJet, said \u201cAccount suspended\u201d, adding: \u201cTwitter suspends accounts that violate the Twitter Rules.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/14/twitter-elon-musk-private-jet-account-suspended\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/14/three-chimpanzees-shot-dead-after-escape-from-swedish-zoo", "title": "Three chimpanzees shot dead after escape from Swedish zoo", "date_published": "2022-12-14 17:26:49+00:00", "description": "<p>Furuviksparken zoo said the animals \u2018tragically\u2019 had to be put down because of the danger to the public</p><p>Three chimpanzees escaped from their enclosure in a Swedish zoo for several hours before being shot dead, according to Swedish media, while a fourth was wounded and a fifth was believed to have returned unharmed to the zoo of its own accord.</p><p>\u201cThey are very strong animals and absolutely not domesticated,\u201d Daniel Wikdahl, a police spokesman, <a href=\"https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/gavleborg/schimpans-pa-rymmen-fran-furuviksparken-tva-dodade\">told the public broadcaster SVT</a> on Wednesday, adding that it had been the zoo\u2019s decision to shoot the four because of the danger to the public.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/14/three-chimpanzees-shot-dead-after-escape-from-swedish-zoo\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/14/once-in-a-lifetime-copy-of-don-quixote-fetches-500000-at-auction", "title": "\u2018Once-in-a-lifetime\u2019 copy of Don Quixote fetches \u20ac500,000 at auction", "date_published": "2022-12-14 17:26:45+00:00", "description": "<p>Total of \u20ac900,000 paid for Cervantes\u2019 works that a diplomat bought on a shopping trip to London in 1930s</p><p>A \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d copy of Miguel de Cervantes\u2019 Don Quixote, printed in Madrid four centuries ago and snapped up by a book-loving Bolivian diplomat in London in the 1930s, has sold at auction in Paris for \u20ac504,000 (\u00a3432,600).</p><p>A first edition of Cervantes\u2019 short story collection, <em>Novelas ejemplares</em> (Exemplary Stories), bought at the same time by the same diplomat, fetched \u20ac403,200 at the sale at Sotheby\u2019s.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/14/once-in-a-lifetime-copy-of-don-quixote-fetches-500000-at-auction\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/dec/14/france-v-morocco-world-cup-2022-semi-final-live", "title": "France v Morocco: World Cup 2022 semi-final \u2013 live", "date_published": "2022-12-14 17:14:55+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>Updates from the second semi-final, kick-off 7pm GMT</li><li>You can contact Rob <a href=\"mailto:rob.smyth@theguardian.com\">here</a> with your thoughts</li></ul><p><strong>Jacob Steinberg\u2019s big-match preview</strong></p><p>And now for something completely different: a World Cup semi-final involving an African team.

Is it gunfire, or a break-in? Where are we? And who is the woman who inhabits this supremely dislocated world? The simple answer is that she is Jessica, a market gardener who grows orchids in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn but is currently in Bogot\u00e1 to be at her sister\u2019s hospital bedside, from which she views the mountainous countryside through a crack in the curtains.

In her search for a physical representation of the sound only she can hear, Jessica visits a recording studio where, with the help of an earnest young sound engineer, Hern\u00e1n (Juan Pablo Urrego), who turns out not to exist, she settles on one described as \u201cbody hits duvet hits wood bat\u201d.

The effects of the pandemic continue to be felt in the games world; 2022 was full of games that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/dec/28/pushing-buttons-video-games-christmas\">were delayed</a> as studios scrambled to adapt to remote working, and I played more than one big-budget game this year that bore the unmistakeable signs of a rush to the finish. The industry also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jul/12/pushing-buttons-is-it-game-over-for-gaming-pandemic-boom\">made less money this year</a>, after unsustainably rapid pandemic-fuelled growth in 2020. In other ways, though, it\u2019s been a slow return to business as usual, as the industry hype machine stirred back to life.</p><p>The huge news of the week is that the $70bn business deal known as Acquisition Blizzard (that is, <strong>Microsoft\u2019s purchase of Activision</strong>, which has been rolling on all year) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/08/us-agency-block-merger-microsoft-activision-blizzard-video-games\">is being blocked</a> by the US Federal Trade Commission. The trade body cited concerns that it would thwart competition, and evidently Xbox\u2019s offer to guarantee Call of Duty on PlayStation (and Nintendo, where the series doesn\u2019t generally appear anyway) did not allay those fears. This news broke right before the Game Awards, interestingly, and Xbox boss, Phil Spencer, did not look happy about it.</p><p>Two big 2023 games have just been confirmed for June: <strong>Street Fighter 6</strong> and <strong>Diablo 4</strong>. That\u2019s also the month of E3\u2019s return under new management, so it\u2019s going to be busy.</p><p>Our own Steve Rose wrote about <strong>Facebook\u2019s giant bet on the metaverse</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/07/metaverse-slow-death-facebook-losing-100bn-gamble-virtual-reality-mark-zuckerberg\">and how that\u2019s currently working out</a>. (Clue: not well, so far.) Every time I read one of these things I think, why on earth are all these companies spending billions to essentially create <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-playstation-home\">PlayStation Home</a>? The ads that Meta has been broadcasting lately \u2013 all about how urban planners will use the metaverse to design the future, etc \u2013 look like what I saw when I played Minecraft with Microsoft\u2019s abandoned Hololens AR headset in 2015.</p><p>Idris Elba stars in <strong>the new Cyberpunk 2077 expansion</strong>. It really is time for me to play this game properly, isn\u2019t it? It barely ran on my PS4 when I first bought it in 2020, but as we all know, CD Projekt Red has been working doggedly to turn its game\u2019s fortunes around and \u2013 alongside a very successful Netflix series \u2013 that hard work has seen Cyberpunk 2077 become an unexpected resurgent success.</p><p>The evidently rather bitter writer/director of Days Gone, Sony\u2019s rather drab 2019 open world biker zombie game, has <a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/days-gone-director-blames-middling-reviews-on-woke-reviewers-and-tech-issues/\">recently claimed</a> that the game didn\u2019t succeed because \u201c<strong>woke reviewers</strong> \u2026 couldn\u2019t handle a gruff white biker looking at his date\u2019s ass\u201d.

After she was gone, we just wanted to recreate it \u2013 and feel like we had her with us again</p><p>When you think of Christmas, which food springs to mind? Perhaps turkey, mince pies or mulled wine? For me, it\u2019s the festive fruit tart my grandmother baked every year, to be eaten on Christmas Eve. When we settled down to eat dessert on 24 December, after all the hustle and bustle of festive preparations, journeys across the country and the tensions that often come with a family Christmas, the serving of the tart was a signal to relax.<br /><br />But when my grandmother died unexpectedly in 2016, we couldn\u2019t find the recipe anywhere. We scoured her kitchen, flicking through cookbooks and notes, but there was no sign of it. Her recipe, it seemed, had died with her.<br /><br />That Christmas was brutal. Our celebrations were muted. Family members would dissolve into tears whenever Little Donkey, one of her favourite carols, played. Everywhere I looked, there were holes where Grandma should have been. She should have been sitting on her usual stool as we opened our presents. She should have been perched on the kitchen stairs while dinner was prepared, her offers of help being batted away. She should have been prodding us out of the door for one of her \u201clittle ambles\u201d to walk off the mince pies. She should have been dishing up her tart on Christmas Eve.<br /><br />For most of my life, my grandmother was the fittest older person I had ever met. Her great passion in life, aside from her family, was walking. She was most herself tramping along a footpath, eating a packed lunch in a sodden field or planning a route along the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/dec/06/home-is-a-state-of-mind-you-dont-need-walls\">South West Coast Path</a>. Even in her 80s, she could make it up a hill faster than me. She seemed invincible.<br /><br />Because of this, and as young people so often do, I thought I had more time with her. I didn\u2019t always text her back, I didn\u2019t call her as often as I should have and didn\u2019t visit nearly enough. I didn\u2019t ask her enough questions. I didn\u2019t take enough photos of her. I didn\u2019t preserve the sound of her voice. I didn\u2019t ask her for her recipes.<br /><br />I thought I had more time. We always think we have more time.</p><p>Five years after that first, difficult Christmas without Grandma, a small group at my church held a meal where everyone was asked to bring a traditional family dish. There was only one thing I could possibly take. I decided \u2013 recipe or not \u2013 to try to recreate the tart. I am no baker; Welsh cakes, cookies and the odd brownie are really my limit. But I thought that maybe I could find something similar to what I recalled of the tart and perhaps tweak it a little. It was time to turn to the internet.<br /><br />I racked my brain: there were cranberries, I knew that. I could picture them, jewel-bright among the other fruit. Something soft. Pear, maybe? Apple? There was a crunch: pecans! I had something to work with.<br /><br />I found a few options that could work, but I thought I would check with my mother in case I remembered the dish wrongly. When she said it might have been a tarte tatin, the game changed. It took just a few seconds online before I found it \u2013 <em>the</em> recipe. It wasn\u2019t some invention of my grandmother\u2019s or a family recipe passed down the generations at all. <a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/home/recipes/recipe_directory/t/tarte_tatin_with_cranberries_and_apple.html\">It was a 2005 recipe from Waitrose</a>, which she must have picked up as a card in the supermarket (to my knowledge she never used the internet for recipes, the reason I hadn\u2019t thought to try online before). There it was on the screen. Grandma\u2019s tart.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/14/moment-changed-me-grandmas-recipe-christmas\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/13/dictionarycom-word-of-the-year-woman", "title": "Dictionary.com announces word of the year: \u2018woman\u2019", "date_published": "2022-12-14 07:00:46+00:00", "description": "<p>Portal said searches for the word increased by 1,400% after Ketanji Brown Jackson was asked to define it in her confirmation hearing</p><p>The website Dictionary.com has named its word of the year for 2022: woman.</p><p>In a statement, the website <a href=\"https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-year/\">said</a>: \u201cOur selection of woman \u2026 reflects how the intersection of gender, identity and language dominates the current cultural conversation and shapes much of our work as a dictionary.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/13/dictionarycom-word-of-the-year-woman\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/14/hospital-wants-83135-dollars-for-saving-my-wife-worth-it-but-where-did-figure-come-from", "title": "Hospital wants $83,135 for saving my wife.
