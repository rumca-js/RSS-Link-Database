But all of that mining, fishing, and digging can get exhausting and tedious over time, so finding ways to cut down on the busy work is always wonderful. One such way is to use a very clever digging trick that will drastically reduce the time you spend filling in the holes you've dug. Read on to find out how to do it.</p><h2>How to fill digging holes in quickly</h2><p>Digging is arguably the least rewarding and most monotonous of all of the tasks you'll be doing around your valley, so the last thing you want to do after farming a biome for materials is go back and slowly fill in the holes you've made one by one. With one little trick, though, you can close in a huge amount of them all at once.</p><figure style=\"width: 3840px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4072717-disneydreamlightvalley_20221206152558.jpg\"><img alt=\"Just drop large structures on holes to fill them in.\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4072717-disneydreamlightvalley_20221206152558.jpg\" /></a><figcaption>Just drop large structures on holes to fill them in.</figcaption></figure><p>To fill in a lot of holes at one time, just <strong>enter Furniture Mode and select a massive structure from around your valley, then lay it on the holes you want to fill</strong> <strong>to instantly reset the ground there</strong>. When you remove the structure, the ground will look as though you never dug there to begin with. The best options for this trick are large homes, such as <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-how-to-unlock-prince-eric/1100-6508918/\">Prince Eric</a>'s castle, but you can also use smaller objects to close in just a few holes if you prefer.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-save-time-with-this-useful-digging-trick/1100-6509768/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-madden-franchise-players-its-latest-issues-come-amid-months-of-disarray/1100-6510065/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "For Madden Franchise Players, Its Latest Issues Come Amid Months Of Disarray", "date_published": "2022-12-14 22:10:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">For <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-23/\">Madden 23</a> players, the recent dysfunction surrounding its Franchise mode is just the latest in a long line of follies since the game launched in August. Seemingly due to faulty cloud services, Madden 23 has been plagued for months with saved data losses and other cloud-based chaos. Though several patches and hotfixes have successfully fixed some of the game's issues, this latest episode is sadly emblematic of the game's deeper issues</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's hard to pinpoint exactly when or why the game's cloud server problems started. It could be that a planned update to the game's servers occurred and broke something, or it could be that cloud services buckled under pressure as buyers and player counts ramped up in the weeks that followed launch. but in any event, it's been a mess. These issues have seemed to affect all modes, but Franchise has been impacted the most. Given that Tiburon once told me Franchise is the game's most popular mode, it's no small matter.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Until mid-October, Franchise players were frequently hit with erased saves. This manifested in a number of ways. Simple team management duties, like setting a depth chart or signing free agents, would be undone. In worse examples, entire games would be lost. It's hard to express how demoralizing it is to play in a competitive Madden league, finish a game, and watch it all disappear as soon as you get back to the menu. Even in defeat, you're losing stats that may have benefited your team with things like individual player upgrades.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-madden-franchise-players-its-latest-issues-come-amid-months-of-disarray/1100-6510065/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-gameplay-trailer-boasts-boss-battles-with-demons-and-legendary-warriors/1100-6510066/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty Gameplay Trailer Boasts Boss Battles With Demons And Legendary Warriors", "date_published": "2022-12-14 22:02:00+00:00", "description": "<p>The new Action trailer for Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty shows off boss fights with demon animals and legendary warriors.

After all, her character is very dead after the events of that first film.

Easy, she plays her own child--sort of.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In The Way of Water, Weaver plays Kiri, the adopted daughter of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), who are now parents to a gaggle of children. Interestingly, the 73-year-old Weaver's character is a teenager in the new film. A strange twist, for sure, but one the actress was very committed to figuring out.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In fact, she was so committed that she went back to school--seriously. Speaking at a press conference for Avatar: The Way of Water, Weaver explained that \"Luckily, there was a long time to prepare, and I went to high school classes and a few other things, so I could hear the pitch of [teenagers'] voices, and there\u2019s a big range of who an adolescent is between 12 and 15.

The second, Oath of Devotion, requires you to pledge to protect justice and order. You can call on this oath to cast Holy Rebuke. This spell surrounds an ally with an aura that deals 1d4 damage to anyone that melee attacks them. Paladins of any subclass can spend a spell slot to cast Divine Smite and add radiant damage to weapon damage.</p><p>Paladins who break the tenets of their oath will become Oathbreakers and gain a new set of abilities and disadvantages, as well as new dialogue and story beats. Paladins can break their oaths for good, nefarious, or ambiguous reasons. The Oathbreaker subclass lets you explore your Paladin's potential beliefs and motivations.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-adds-paladins-and-reworks-reactions-in-the-last-major-update-before-release/1100-6510054/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-modern-warfare-2-and-warzone-2-0-how-to-unlock-the-chimera-assault-rifle/1100-6510053/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "CoD: Modern Warfare 2 And Warzone 2.0 - How To Unlock The Chimera Assault Rifle", "date_published": "2022-12-14 19:46:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-modern-warfare-2-and-warzone-2-mid-season-update-includes-a-raid-and-soccer-themed-ltm/1100-6509928/\">mid-season update for Season 1</a> of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20/\">Call of Duty: Warzone 2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii/\">Modern Warfare 2</a> arrived on December 14, and the big update included the new Chimera assault rifle.

And why shouldn\u2019t it be? Lingering doubts that provide ample pause and existential questions that can lead to dread or clarity are just as much a part of the holiday season as the ice and cold.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Horror is year round for the biggest fans, including everyone here at GameSpot, which is why we\u2019ve been busy all year making sure every kind of scare you could imagine is all organized and ready for your personal lists.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Everything from <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-7-best-all-ages-horror-movies-you-can-watch-right-now-and-where-to-stream-them/2900-4427/\">all-ages appropriate horror</a> (after all, everyone is <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/halloween-ends-review-whats-the-opposite-of-sticking-the-landing/1900-6417980/\">entitled to at least one good scare, right</a>?) to the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-7-most-sinister-and-scary-slow-burn-horror-films-to-watch-this-halloween/2900-4367/\">most sinister selections</a> we could find, including a roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-12-most-essential-queer-horror-films-to-watch-before-hulus-hellraiser-arrives/2900-4363/\">best queer and trans stories you can stream</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">GameSpot isn\u2019t just your one-stop scream through most of the year though: we\u2019ve got screams to stream all year round, including on Christmas day and beyond, which are perfect for anyone cool coming to visit you this holiday season.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Chilling wind on December nights has always brought something else with it, buried underneath, and hidden away from view. Some think nothing of it, forgetting about it without even needing to decide or not. But there are those of us that know that light off in the distance might just disappear before it\u2019s nearer.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And it\u2019s for those curious individuals with an interest in exploring the deepest moments, insecurities, and dreams of the human spirit that GameSpot has prepared a list with the best horror films to haunt your holidays this season.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Krampus (2015)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277841/4077075-krampus.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Krampus is coming and Krampus is near, which means you should have plenty of fear. 2015's Krampus is such a smooth ride, containing both comedy and horror, in almost equal portions. Adam Scott and David Kochener provide some much needed laughs but Toni Collette\u2019s iconic gasps and scream will remind you that this is certainly no winter wonderland dream.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Krampus delivers on the untold horrors and wonders of the holiday season with a tumultuous extended family gathering being interrupted by the titular terror himself. Nightmarish special effects help tighten an already frightful time, culminating in one of the best holiday films any horror fan can watch, and worthy of carrying the Krampus name.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277841/4077076-sally-nightmare-before-christmas.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Henry Selick and a creative team helped bring Tim Burton\u2019s original poem to life in a most spectacular way, giving life to a stop motion storybook for the ages. Pumpkin King Jack Skellington has led Halloween Town through endless celebration, each more successful and festive than the lost, but he\u2019s grown tired and disillusioned with his purpose, identity, and duties.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sally, a woman created in a lab to serve her creator, dreams of more, so much more, just like Jack, though her visions stretch a little further than the leader and ruler over Halloween.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Jack decides to take Christmas into his own hands, literally, setting of a chain of tricks and treats, ultimately resulting in the town learning not just the true meaning of Halloween and Christmas, but also themselves.</p><p>Though it is impossible to responsibly discuss The Nightmare Before Christmas without also addressing its issues with both racism and upholding the damage it does, the film can still be enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@bona.bones/video/7015720392983727365\">while also used as a teaching tool</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Black Christmas (1974)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277841/4077078-black-chrstmas-1974.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/12-horror-movies-on-shudder-that-are-dying-to-be-watched-this-halloween/2900-4398/\">https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/12-horror-movies-on-shudder-that-are-dying-to-be-watched-this-halloween/2900-4398/</a>Black Christmas follows a bloodthirsty killer that stalks a group of sorority sisters over the Christmas season, hunting silently and moving quickly, made possible by hiding on campus, among the students.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Chilling phone calls give more pause than the temperature as the women all fight for their lives in this harrowing, holiday tale.</p><p>We went into more detail in our writeup of the<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/10-horror-movies-and-tv-shows-that-will-make-you-wish-they-were-video-game-adaptations/2900-4462/\">10 Horror Movies And TV Shows That Will Make You Wish They Were Video Game Adaptations</a>where I compared the film to 2014\u2019s Until Dawn. Both are best enjoyed with locked doors and hot chocolate.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. A Very Ghoul Log Christmas (2021)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277841/4077081-shudder-ghoul-tide.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Yule love this simple yet spooky selection that can be streamed on Shudder this holiday season. Or any time you want to pretend you\u2019re warmer than you are while enjoying a spooky, little fire.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">With countless digital yule logs to choose from, across nearly every streaming service, you won\u2019t find a more chilling fire than on Shudder.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. American Psycho (2000)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277841/4077083-american-psycho.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>American Psycho has all the characteristics of a horror film but Christan Bale\u2019s iconic performance in director May Harron\u2019s overtly feminist film takes place near and around Christmas, so it counts. Though there\u2019s speculation over whether the deadly blows from Bale\u2019s monstrous character actually did. A hazy, unreliable narrator and sharp commentary across several themes, including toxic masculinity, help sharpen American Psycho into one of the best cut horror films you can call a Christmas movie.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Better Watch Out (2017)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277841/4077084-betterwatchout.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Better Watch Out is about 17-year-old babysitter Ashley and the bratty kid, Luke, that she\u2019s watching on a cold winter night. Things start out pretty normal, with the two just watching a horror movie together, like all cool people do on dark, December nights.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Luke\u2019s repeated failed attempts to make moves on Ashley eventually escalate into Home Alone levels of violence, but Joe Pesci doesn\u2019t get back up in this one.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Better Watch Out carries the same playfulness as films such as Happy Death Day and Ready or Not as Ashely fights for her life, sticking to whatever she can to stay alive and make it through these bumps in the night.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Anna and the Apocalypse (2017)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277841/4077086-anna-and-the-apocalypse.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Anna and the Apocalypse has a scene where a woman decapitates a zombie with a seesaw and that\u2019s when I realized we need more Christmas zombie mashups.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Anna and the Apocalypse is a violent and magical, zombie, Christmas movie \u2013 and if that\u2019s not enough to sway you: it\u2019s also a musical. Anna and the Apocalypse follows Anna and John, two friends that maybe could be more, as they bond and shuffle their feet through a zombie plague that\u2019s taken over their town.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The film contains a lot of heart (not just the kind zombies munch on) and goes a lot further than you might expect from a film with brain-eating zombies.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277841/4077087-michael-caine-christmas-ghost.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Perhaps the best adaptation of Charles Dickens\u2019s classic tale, The Muppet Christmas Carol stars Charles Dickens and Rizzo the Rat--even though Dickens bears a striking resemblance to Gonzo--in a Muppets retelling of three ghosts and a true, changed heart. At first glance, you may wonder why this is on a list of horror movies, but one look at either the Ghost of Christmas Future or Past should be enough to solve that problem. It's some of the most horrifying Muppet imagery of all time, showcased brilliantly across surreal, practical effects.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Michael Cain\u2019s performance as Ebenezer Scrooge helps ground the story, which is important since the economic disparity and horrifying labor conditions from business owners is the most realistic part of the film. A problem <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/hyundai-supplier-accused-child-labor-violations-by-us-authorities-2022-08-23/\">we seem to still be working on solving it seems</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Brian Henson\u2019s directorial debut sees all the right stars in all the right places as everyone does their part to apply magical realism and classic Muppets humor.</p></h3></p><br />", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiversus-players-can-now-duke-it-out-as-dwayne-johnson-in-front-of-the-iron-throne/1100-6510052/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "MultiVersus Players Can Now Duke It Out As Dwayne Johnson In Front Of The Iron Throne", "date_published": "2022-12-14 19:06:00+00:00", "description": "<p>The latest update to <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/multiversus/\">MultiVersus</a> continues to expand Warner Bros. platform fighter, introducing a new Game of Thrones-inspired map, holiday event, and for those willing to spend a little cash, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson himself.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Johnson enters the MultiVersus arena as a <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-adam-comes-to-multiversus-with-arcade-mode/1100-6508766/\">variant for Black Adam</a>, the super anti-hero who he recently <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-black-adam/1100-6508395/\">portrayed in the DC film of the same name</a> and that <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-adam-will-turn-a-profit-the-rock-says/1100-6509742/\">Johnson insists will, in fact, make a profit</a>.

The map features an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNmH0YNCRak\">epic remix of Ramin Djawadi's legendary theme music</a> for players to enjoy while duking it out, to boot.

Kratos soon realizes the journey is an epic quest in disguise, one which will test the bonds between father and son, and force Kratos to battle new Gods and monsters for the fate of the world.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-tv-adaptation-gets-series-order/1100-6510046/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-deals-save-big-on-exclusives-and-great-gift-ideas/2900-4536/", "title": "Best Nintendo Switch Deals - Save Big On Exclusives And Great Gift Ideas", "date_published": "2022-12-14 18:37:00+00:00", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4076972-papermarioorigamiking%282%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>With the holidays fast approaching, retailers are slashing prices on a wide assortment of gaming gear--including a ton of Nintendo Switch games and accessories.

Debates are had, and eventually we arrive at a small handful of games--as in recent years, this year it's a total of 10--that we feel broadly represents the group's feelings about what's best. But that doesn't mean there aren't other games we're passionate about.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sometimes, it might just be that there isn't room in the team's top 10 even when a bunch of folks love it--hundreds of games release each year, so we have to make concessions somewhere. Other times, only a single person has played a game that they think is incredible and so putting it in the team's top 10 wouldn't be an accurate representation of GameSpot as a whole. But just because they can't make<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2022/2900-4517/\"> our top 10</a> doesn't mean we don't want to still spotlight these beloved games. As always, even in this exercise, we can't include <em>everything </em>we've enjoyed from the year, because even in a period full of delays and pandemic-impacted development, there are still countless great games deserving of time and attention.</p><p>With that in mind, here is a look--in no particular order--at a selection of games released in 2022 that at least one person on staff loved but that didn't make our top 10 of 2022. For even more highlights from the year, check out our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/best-games-of-2022/\">Best Of 2022 hub</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MLB The Show 22</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4077015-8055195882-apps.54851.14242513445323926.f2c89813-3bd8-4c71-8bb0-b6aba7234ee0.38e569dc-cdcd-4f3b-a64f-dc6bcde1f766.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><em>Available on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">I love baseball. If I could spend the rest of my life doing nothing but playing and watching baseball, I'd die happy (especially if my Pittsburgh Pirates would stop losing). While many sports game franchises experience lots of peaks and valleys over the years, Sony's MLB The Show is an exception. It's an excellent baseball simulation every single year, and MLB The Show 22 is one of my absolute favorites. Making contact on that hanging curveball and knocking it over the fence feels as good as ever, as does getting a big swing and miss on a high-and-tight heater to end a game. I found myself in a trance for months, playing for nearly 400 hours, and long after the Pirates' season had ended with laughable failure.</p><p>It's not just the on-field action that MLB The Show 22 gets so right, however, but also everything that surrounds it. In particular, the Diamond Dynasty mode remains the fairest \"no money spent\" online card-collecting mode in its class. Unlike Madden and many other sports games, you get new players at a very generous pace, and I put together a formidable squad without ever spending a dime. Taking out the constant pressure to spend cash let me focus on what I actually wanted to do: play ball. -- <em>Gabe Gurwin</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Arcade Paradise</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4077016-8979491690-ss_7f.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><em>Available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The sights and sounds of a '90s arcade serve as the perfect backdrop for this stellar fusion of management sim and minigame collection. As the proprietor of a laundromat with some arcade machines stowed in the back, you start by doing the mundane work of managing dirty clothes while occasionally saving up enough to get a new arcade machine. Before long, you're expanding your business as income from your arcade machines overtakes the laundry.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I couldn't help but keep coming back to Arcade Paradise. The arcade machines themselves are all full-fledged games like you would actually find in an old arcade. And like an actual arcade, some are better than others, so you'll gravitate towards your favorites. But pulling off feats in the arcade machines increases their popularity and earning potential, so you play the arcade games to earn more money to buy more arcade machines. It's a satisfying cycle that makes Arcade Paradise hard to put down.</p><p>Wrapped in this gameplay loop is a beautifully told story that sneaks up on you. At first you get only hints and overtones of your relationship with your workaholic father who put you in charge of the laundromat to teach you some responsibility, and with your sister who had her own aspirations crushed by his overbearing expectations--all delivered through voicemails and chat messages left at your arcade's office. As the story develops, it takes a serious turn, and in doing so, it illustrates important aspects of growing up, becoming your own person, and finding your own joy. It is my favorite video game story of the year, from a remarkably unexpected source. -- <em>Steve Watts</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>McPixel 3</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4077017-1164909369-ss_19.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><em>Available on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The original McPixel was a delight, offering a take on WarioWare-style microgames that was more like a point-and-click adventure/puzzle game but was ultimately most concerned with making you laugh with its absurdity. Its sequel, McPixel 3--the second game was skipped entirely, in a weird coincidence with Goat Simulator 3 launching just days after it--is <em>exactly </em>what I would want from such a game: the same formula, but made grander, with more in-depth levels, more content, and the same absurdist sense of humor.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As in the first game, you're faced with a series of relatively short stages in which you have to somehow avert disaster. That might involve spoofs of Among Us or beat-em-ups, or interacting with an old-school operating system, but generally you want to avoid having an explosive go off. Stages are now grouped into themes, like a bunch that are TV show-inspired, and can be far more elaborate than what's come before.</p><p>But the critical component--the humor--remains intact. I actively would not want to pass levels because so much of the fun stems from discovering the many gags within a given level that lead to McPixel being blown up. Who wants to succeed when you can seemingly attempt to place a fish into a fish bowl, only for McPixel himself to instead dive in head-first? Add in another incredible soundtrack and you have a must-play game for anyone who loves silliness. -- <em>Chris Pereira</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Signalis</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4077039-5323083303-ss_9d.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><em>Available on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">My idea of what constitutes a good game is almost entirely vibes-based. Some of the best experiences I've ever had with video games can be boiled down into long stretches of walking slowly through eerie, poorly lit buildings and finding tiny scraps of lore through snips of dialogue or random collectibles I've made my character fish out of the trash. So it's really no surprise that a game like Signalis would very easily make it to the top of my personal Best Of list for 2022.</p><p>It's not uncommon for spooky games to be compared to Silent Hill. For a while, literally anything that featured a dimly lit hallway was \"just like PT!\" But bear with me here. Signalis actually <em>is </em>a lot like Silent Hill. The combat system is, and I say this affectionately, best described as \"clunky.\" The camera angles are forced and disorienting. Most of the monsters just kind of shamble towards you, and the ones that are more aggressive move less like killing machines and more like wounded animals. But more than that, the lore itself is esoteric and doled out in in-universe riddles that are, by and large, left up to your interpretation. It's moody and atmospheric, full of ominous dialogue and mysteries that slowly snowball from \"I wonder what terrible thing happened here\" to \"I wonder if I'm going to survive the terrible thing that happened here\" before escalting into \"Is the terrible thing that happened here even <em>real?</em>\" In other words: A nearly perfect survival-horror experience. <em>-- Mason Downey</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4077020-0658947843-MWII-.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Call of Duty franchise is probably my favorite series in gaming, so even after 2021's Call of Duty: Vanguard didn't resonate with me, I was eagerly awaiting Modern Warfare II. Thankfully, it delivered in a big way. I've always enjoyed the way Infinity Ward's Call of Duty games, and specifically the Modern Warfare series, have \"felt\" in my hands. There is something about the developer's specific game engine that just feels good and consistent and rewarding.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Modern Warfare II is thankfully no exception, and I've been playing Modern Warfare II basically every day since it was released in late October. The campaign successfully delivers another high-octane, white-knuckle globetrotting adventure with incredible setpieces. But my favorite part of the Call of Duty series continues to be its multiplayer, and Modern Warfare II has a multitude of excellent multiplayer offerings--and this is to say nothing of Warzone 2.0 and DMZ! My favorite element of multiplayer has to be Invasion for Ground War.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I've always wanted a large-scale multiplayer experience similar to Battlefield but with Call of Duty's gunplay, and Ground War packs a satisfying punch. I enjoy the mode mostly because of the massive maps and slower-paced gameplay, which means you aren't dying every few seconds like you do in traditional multiplayer. It's also a fantastic battleground to practice your sniping skills with many long sightlines and places to take cover, pop out, and take down enemies who never saw you coming.</p><p>Multiple Seasons of new content are in the works for Modern Warfare II multiplayer, so I plan to keep the party going throughout the holidays and into the new year. Long live Call of Duty. -- <em>Eddie Makuch</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Metal Hellsinger</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4077023-8616615558-40341.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Available on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, PC</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>When it comes to music, I'm not usually a metal fan. I love Deftones and System of a Down, but my interest in the genre ends there for the most part. I'm even less interested in the Hell aesthetic that so often accompanies the genre, with depictions of demons and infernos and other music video fare. Despite those preferences, Metal Hellsinger is one of the coolest experiences I had all year in video games.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The game plays like Doom meets Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, with a dash of Rock Band thrown in. As a rhythm-based FPS, you'll shotgun-blast and sword-slash your way through the nine circles of Hell to the beat of some ferocious original music, achieving killer combos as you annihilate the many fiery minions standing in your way. The game quickly proves irresistible, as each original song, featuring vocalists from leading acts like Trivium and Refused, are made more fun when you're shooting monsters to the tune of them, synchronizing each shot the same way one somehow manages to choreograph their own chaos in the pit in front of a concert stage.</p><p>In a creative twist that really amplifies the stakes, each song picks up with more and more sections as you climb the game's score multiplier. Beginning with just the most basic instrumentation, layers are added with every success up to the ultimate x16 score, which is when vocals pour in and light the arena on fire--figuratively, but sort of literally too--like the encore to an incredible show. At a time when bands are touring less, or just now getting back on the road, Metal Hellsinger has been the fierce, frenetic, theatrical concert experience I've been missing, and it's given me a renewed opinion on the musical genre it celebrates as a whole. And that final boss to the tune of what is essentially a new System of a Down song? It's a real (head) banger. <em>-- Mark Delaney</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Potionomics</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4077025-0432804608-ss_1a.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><em>Available on PC</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">I like making money and kissing cuties. Potionomics lets me do both, making it easily my favorite game of 2022. In a year surprisingly filled with games that featured potion-brewing or digital card collecting, Potionomics rises above its peers with its charmingly expressive characters, sharp writing, and gratifying gameplay loop built around haggling mechanics and a narratively rewarding deckbuilding system.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sylvia's negotiations with customers play out as a card game, with Sylvia's available haggling techniques for each turn randomly drawn from a deck. New cards can be obtained by talking to the town's citizens or your fellow shopkeepers, with each card tied to a conversational skill used by whichever character gave you that card. This cleverly reflects how, in real life, folks tend to adopt the mannerisms and vocabulary of their closest friends. So as you discover who you like spending time with, you'll naturally spend more time with them and unlock more of their cards, shifting Sylvia's way of speaking to reflect how her friends talk and informing who Sylvia is as a person and what type of shopkeeper she becomes by the story's end.</p><p>Of course, my favorite part of getting to know the diverse cast of characters is learning the backstories for all the cute ones--of which, dear reader, there are <em>so many</em>--so that I can smooch as many as possible and romance the best ones over numerous playthroughs. I found Potionomics' characters to be endlessly endearing, bringing delightful charm to the role-playing side of this superb game. If you haven't played Potionomics yet, you owe it to yourself to check it out. -- <em>Jordan Ram\u00e9e</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Tinykin</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4077028-6323857565-403605.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Tinykin made me feel like a kid again. Maybe it was the '90s family home I was exploring, or the way that movement and exploration were both frictionless and fun. In fact, I'd find myself often abandoning what I was meant to be doing just to zip around its levels, either by climbing to its highest peaks and gently floating down, or speeding around the floor on a bar of soap. But overall, I think it was because Tinykin encouraged me to take a childlike approach to what it was showing me.</p><p>It gave me a world where bugs could talk, tiny creatures would become my friends and help me out of trouble, and one where I was an astronaut who needed to fix his ship using household items which obviously had more uses than advertised. Playing Tinykin reminded me of being a kid who had dreamt up an elaborate play scenario, but who also didn't necessarily have the toys to act it out properly, so I'd have to improvise with whatever I could find. In the game, those scenarios could be as simple as baking a cake or setting up a pool party, but using my Tinykin and my imagination, it meant that those tasks felt a lot bigger, more involved, and crucially, way more satisfying to complete. Tinykin isn't a particularly long game--I finished it in two sittings--but it stuck with me ever since. In a time where everything is very serious, it felt good to feel like a kid again, even if it was just for a little bit. <em>-- Lucy James</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Destiny 2: The Witch Queen</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4077029-0258143870-393794.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p><em>Available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Destiny 2: The Witch Queen is a campaign triumph for a post-Activision expansion drop in the Destiny universe. Compared to The Taken King or Forsaken, expansions like Shadowkeep or Beyond Light just felt\u2026smaller. They lacked the sheer volume of content I had come to expect from a \"comet\" expansion, and I was initially hesitant with The Witch Queen.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That all changed the moment I tried the new campaign. The Witch Queen pulls back the veil and gives fans several revelations about enemies and factions we've fought with (or alongside) for years now. There are also plenty of jaw-dropping moments when the significant story moments are revealed, particularly involving Savathun, the Witch Queen herself.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the fact that The Witch Queen is really just a setup for the climactic Lightfall expansion coming in 2023, it still felt like its own complete arc of consequential events and admissions for the characters of the world: Tensions rise, questions about future threats linger, and the face of the darkness, our greatest enemy, has finally been revealed.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I would be remiss to not mention the new Legendary difficulty in the campaign, which is an absolute game-changer. The level cap, limited respawn, and increased enemy difficulty gives the campaign another dimension and is without a doubt a highlight of the experience, and a dramatic change from past expansions. Of course, the live-service content, the endgame, and the new Throne World location are all excellent, but it's a testament to just how exceptional the world and story of Destiny is that the highlight of the expansion this time isn't just the raid, but the campaign.</p><p>My relationship with Destiny 2 has been tenuous at times. The evolution of this game has been surreal to witness and play alongside over the last several years, but it's the world and story of Destiny that keeps me coming back, even if I start feeling the seasonal fatigue. Destiny 2: The Witch Queen is easily the strongest Destiny expansion in the entire franchise to me, and the stakes for Lightfall couldn't be higher. -- <em>David Ahmadi</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4077030-7299772285-39184.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><em>Available on Nintendo Switch</em></p><p>The first time I played Pokemon was a magical experience. I picked a Cyndaquil as my starter in Pokemon Gold and I grew absurdly attached to the little guy. I remember playing on the school bus, the other kids crowding around my Game Boy Color, and the memories of that innocent era brings a level of nostalgia that I love and am constantly in search of. I've played every mainline Pokemon game since, which is why it stuns me to say, without exaggeration, that Pokemon Legends: Arceus was the first Pokemon game in a <em>very</em> long time to capture that original nostalgia.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The gameplay and (semi-) open-world design of Arceus is a giant risk that paid off for Game Freak. Exploring the world, seeing Pokemon stumble around grassy fields or rolling hills--it all feels almost too good to be true. The gameplay loop is so strong that I ended up yearning to play Arceus again after playing Pokemon Scarlet and noticing a lot of Arceus' Pokemon-catching elements are absent in the newer game.</p><p>Of course, I wish that the game didn't have as many cosmetic blemishes or texture pop-ins, but the essence of the game is very much intact. Exploring Pokemon Legends: Arceus is everything my younger self would have wanted and to have the chance to relive that original fantasy for real was enough to make a grown man start to tear up. <em>-- David Ahmadi</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Cursed to Golf</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4077033-9864616257-402251.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p><em>Available on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PS4, and Xbox One</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">My obsession with golf--both in real life and in video games--leads me to play every golf game I can get my hands on. In 2022, I played a golf game that was unlike any other before it: Cursed to Golf. In a year that marked the return of Tiger Woods to virtual golf via PGA Tour 2K23, the game that took hold of me and wouldn't let go was a side-scrolling roguelike with ingenious level design and inventive golf mechanics.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In Cursed to Golf, you're struck by lightning while on the verge of winning the biggest tournament of your professional career. Sadly, you die, and it's game over. Just kidding, golf is inevitable. Confined to Golf Purgatory, a diabolical underworld controlled by the mysterious Greenskeeper, you must work your way through an 18-hole course to prove your worth and come back to life.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Cursed to Golf's twist on side-scrolling golf mechanics comes in the form of Ace Cards. These power-ups are incredibly varied, from altering ball physics and the environment to top-level perks like mulligans and bonus shots. Since you only start with five shots on each hole, making use of Ace Cards is critical to making it through each hole, especially as the layouts become increasingly elaborate. With branching paths, plenty of risky shortcuts, and valuable idols to smash scattered throughout that add much-needed strokes to your par count, Cursed to Golf compels you to plan ahead. At the same time, you can also be rewarded for experimentation. There's a seemingly endless number of ways to approach each level.</p><p>I also love how Cursed to Golf handles its roguelike systems. If you fail, you go back to the beginning of the course. But you learn crucial lessons along the way, and when you defeat each of the unique bosses, you earn useful perks that propel you to keep going. Though it doesn't have randomized levels, there are more than 70 possible holes, so each run does offer a ton of variety. Cursed to Golf is never unfair, and it always feels like you're making progress, which I think is one of the most important features of any good roguelike. <em>-- Steven Petite</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Potion Permit</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4077035-1688422081-hero.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><em>Available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The reason I've selected Potion Permit as my game to spotlight is simple: While the charming life sim is far from perfect, more people playing it means there's a greater chance it will get the sequel it desperately deserves. I believe that Potion Permit has the capability to become a beloved franchise similar to Harvest Moon or Story of Seasons. While bugs and some half-baked elements kept it from fully reaching its potential, the parts that work do so <em>extremely</em> well.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For starters, Potion Permit's gameplay loop of diagnosing patients, foraging for herbs, slaying beasts, and brewing potions is simple yet satisfying. Its overarching story, which sees you, a state chemist, righting the wrongs the state has done to a small community and its ecosystem, is tender and a joy to watch unfold. Finding new biomes, unlocking new friendships and intimate relationships, and all the other ways the world of Potion Permit opens up to you are enticing, and made me sink an ungodly amount of hours into the game in an embarrassingly short period of time.</p><p>In short, I think Potion Permit is perfect in concept. It provided me with an experience I didn't even know I wanted, but now that I've played it, I have higher expectations for life sims than I previously did. It corrects many of the perceived downfalls with other \"cozy games\"--which can at times feel a bit aimless or similar to one another--by having a very forward-moving story and this deeper sense of purpose baked into your character. Though the final product might be slightly off, there are so many elements that make Potion Permit an intoxicating elixir. <em>-- Jessica Howard</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4077036-6969705658-399956.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Available on Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">As DLC, Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course didn't get as much attention as it would have if it were a brand-new title. However, don't let the DLC tag deceive: The Delicious Last Course is a fantastic entree and Cuphead experience, and well worth playing if you're a fan of 2D action games. Like its predecessor, the gameplay is tight, well-designed, and filled with fantastically engaging bosses who each contain three phases to their fights, all with interesting dynamics and bullet-hell surprises.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Just like the original game, the animation for The Delicious Last Course is absolutely stunning and filled with fun and hilarious imagery throughout, with plenty of small details you'll likely miss in the frenetic gameplay. The DLC contains some of my now favorite bosses in the entire game, and a couple of secrets to boot.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Asides from the standard fair we've seen in Cuphead before, one of the biggest additions in The Delicious Last Course is new playable character Ms. Chalice. Ms. Chalice gives players a double jump, and an invincibility-frame roll. These additions, as well as some other minor gameplay tweeks to her, make her a fantastic new addition that will make you rethink your strategy on every boss--especially since you can now use her to face any boss from the original game. It adds an entire new optional mechanic, and one I found myself highly impressed by after using her.</p><p>Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course is one of those games you can tell the developers absolutely filled with passion, from the art to the well-thought-through design of each boss and each individual phase. It's an absolute blast, and it got me to replay the entirety of the original game through virtue of how much fun it was to play as Ms. Chalice. -- <em> Dave Klein</em></p></h3></p><br />", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-2-mid-season-patch-notes-include-major-qol-updates-and-nerf-for-overpowered-ai/1100-6510044/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "CoD: Warzone 2 Mid-Season Patch Notes Include Major QoL Updates And Nerf For Overpowered AI", "date_published": "2022-12-14 17:42:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20/\">Call of Duty: Warzone 2</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-2-and-modern-warfare-2-season-1-reloaded-start-times-and-details/1100-6509641/\">Season 1 Reloaded update</a> is live, and Raven Software has revealed the patch notes for the big mid-season update.

Its gritty world, monstrous foes, and outstanding depth of content make it stand out in the crowded RPG space even years after its original launch, making its <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-next-gen-update-review-winds-howlin/1900-6416135/\">release on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a> all the more notable.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">However, I think most fans can agree that it's the game's many memorable side quests that truly elevate it to the pantheon of great RPGs. And while there are quite a few that could be called the best, my personal favorite is \"A Towerful Of Mice,\" an early-game option that has all of the game's best qualities.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In general, the side quests of The Witcher 3 can be grouped into a few different categories. There are the witcher contracts, where Geralt has to hunt down a monster for pay. Then there are the quest chains, which usually involve Geralt romancing one of his potential love interests, like Yennefer. Then there are the weird one-offs, which have no impact on the game's overall story but often bring an unexpected twist or a strange character into things. A Towerful of Mice manages to mix all three of these categories together for great effect.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-3s-best-side-quest-isnt-about-geralt-its-about-his-job/1100-6510020/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-5-best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2022/2900-4495/", "title": "The 5 Best Nintendo Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2022", "date_published": "2022-12-14 14:00:00+00:00", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4072271-3199140-4206652911-switc.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The Nintendo Switch is getting up in years, but the hybrid portable console is still going strong. The platform had a solid year of great new releases, especially from outside the realm of Nintendo's usual top-tier franchises. Games like Kirby and Switch Sports were excellent callbacks to some beloved brands that didn't lean hard on bigger names like Mario or Zelda. Xenoblade Chronicles marked another enormous RPG for the platform that has become known as a destination for playing epics on the go.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the realm of Nintendo's biggest franchises, this was a year of unusual entries. Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope returned to the bizarre tactical game partnership between Nintendo and Ubisoft, to exceptional results. And Pokemon Legends: Arceus was a big departure from the usual Pokemon formula, helping to chart a new path forward that we saw partly iterated on in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, which released later in the year.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Nintendo was not immune to delays, however, which pushed some games outside of the 2022 release window. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom--previously informally known as Breath of the Wild 2--was pushed to May 2023. And in an unpredictable turn of events, Nintendo made the last-minute decision to indefinitely delay the release of Advance Wars Reboot Camp in light of the ongoing war in Ukraine. Either or both of those games remain among our most anticipated, and could very well have landed on this list.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Despite those hurdles, this was an incredibly strong year for the Nintendo Switch, with a wide array of games that will keep you playing docked and handheld well into the new year. Below, we've outlined our picks for the five best Nintendo Switch exclusives of 2022, in no particular order.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4072275-4046659-untitled%282%29.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle was a bizarre mashup of Nintendo's Mario, Ubisoft's Rabbids, and XCOM-like combat. It worked incredibly well despite its disparate elements, but the follow-up proved itself much more than a mere iterative sequel. Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope is an improvement in every meaningful way, borrowing just enough Mario DNA to make a tactical experience that's unique to the genre.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The most obvious difference is the free-flowing movement, allowing you to run around the battlefield almost like you would in a traditional Mario platformer. At first blush, this change may seem superficial, but it actually has a profound impact on gameplay, allowing you to chain your squad's moves one after another to gain a tactical advantage over your foes. The Sparks system, too, gives you an enormous amount of flexibility over your team composition and strategy, for an experience unlike any other game of its type.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Put simply, Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope is an absolute delight,\" Steve Watts wrote in GameSpot's <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-review-this-sparks-joy/1900-6417985/\">Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Joy review</a>. \"This is a combination that shouldn't work and yet it more than works--it excels. When Ubisoft announced Kingdom Battle, the concept seemed so goofy that its success came as a surprise. Sparks of Hope is an improvement in every meaningful way, from the characterization and world-building to combat variety and flexibility to environmental diversity. Ubisoft loves and respects these characters, and has now shown definitively that even something as familiar and comfortable as Mario is still capable of surprising us over and over again.\"</p><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Mario-Rabbids-Sparks-Hope-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B09742H73B?tag=gamespotdeals-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:gs-2900-4495|vg:-|st:dtp\">See at Amazon</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4072279-4015047-xenoblade3tipsthumb.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">With its hybrid combination of TV and portable functionality, the Nintendo Switch is an ideal venue for deep, meaty RPG experiences. It doesn't get much more substantial than Xenoblade Chronicles, the latest epic from Monolith Soft. The sprawling tale of warring nations tackles themes of sacrifice and community, and while its delivery is sometimes held back by awkward dialogue, it's enough to care deeply about these characters once the story hits its stride.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Equally ambitious is the revised combat system, with 23 classes and unlockable Master Arts that add an extra layer of tactical flexibility. A streamlined menu system makes it easy to manage your MMO-like party, and the result is a system that rewards experimentation as you play with different party compositions and loadouts. That level of complexity gives the experience its longevity, as our reviewer still found new options and Master Arts after 120 hours.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Xenoblade Chronicles 3 feels like the game Monolith Soft has been trying to craft for years,\" Jake Dekker wrote in GameSpot's <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review-masters-of-war/1900-6417921/\">Xenoblade Chronicles 3 review</a>. \"While its dialogue could have used an extra pass, it more than makes up for it with its wonderful story and superb combat. It's rare for a JRPG to hold my attention for a 100-hour runtime, but Xenoblade Chronicles 3 did it with confidence.\"</p><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Xenoblade-Chronicles-3-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B09KRH3FD6/?tag=gamespotdeals-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:gs-2900-4495|vg:-|st:dtp\">See at Amazon</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4072277-3955562-kfl_ns_01_introstage%2Bcarby%2Belfilin%2Bworld1-1%2Bvendingmouth%2Bconemouth.mov.00_07_26_35.still004.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">One of Nintendo's most recognizable mascot characters, Kirby has seen his fair share of platformers, along with more experimental projects on handheld platforms like the Nintendo DS. Even so, the little pink puffball still managed to surprise us this year with Kirby and the Forgotten Land. The more open-structured platformer is akin to the Mario 3D Land and World games, with diorama-like environments filled with challenges and obstacles to overcome.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This time, the world is built to look more realistic, with real-world objects like traffic cones and even cars for Kirby to gobble down. When he takes on a particularly large object he transforms into Mouthful Mode, a clever way to get new gameplay functionality out of his classic eating mechanic. Not only that, but this game also gives us upgradable versions of many of the classic Kirby power-ups. You don't have to settle for a little flame ability anymore, as you can become a lava-spewing terror instead. It all culminates in one of the wildest endings in a Kirby game to date, showing the character still has some tricks up his sleeves. Does Kirby have sleeves? You get the idea.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Kirby and the Forgotten Land is one of those games that's hard to play without constantly having a silly smile on your face,\" Steven Petite wrote in GameSpot's <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review-the-best-kirby-yet/1900-6417850/\">Kirby and the Forgotten Land review</a>. \"It's far more than just a cute and charming platformer with colorful visuals, though. This is one of the best platformers on Nintendo Switch thanks to its brilliantly designed stages and a dynamic arsenal of abilities that consistently shake up the moment-to-moment platforming and action. And FrankenKirby, if you're reading this review, please don't eat me. I don't have any cool powers anyway.\"</p><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Kirby-Forgotten-Land-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B09H221SH4/?tag=gamespotdeals-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:gs-2900-4495|vg:-|st:dtp\">See at Amazon</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4072276-3918422-pokemon-legends-arceus.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Pokemon fans got not just one but two major Pokemon releases this year, and they were each special in their own way. For our money, though, the standout was Pokemon Legends: Arceus, a prequel that takes place in an era inspired by the Japanese colonization period. The new setting allowed for a very different take on the Pokemon formula, including a semi-open world structure full of sprawling environments to explore.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Rather than the traditional quest of catching wild Pokemon and rising to the ranks of Pokemon Master, Arceus put you in the role of a Pokemon researcher. That meant completing research tasks like defeating a certain number of Pokemon, capturing a certain type, and more. The gameplay changed to facilitate this new take on the Pokemon norm, with the ability to catch Pokemon in the wild by simply tossing a PokeBall without being seen. It mixed stealth, traditional Pokemon mechanics, and exploration into a package that was hard to resist.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Some of the new ideas in Arceus have rough edges, and it's slow to start before you get access to many environments and mounts,\" Steve Watts wrote in GameSpot's <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-what-pokemon-is-evolving/1900-6417818/\">Pokemon Legends: Arceus review</a>. \"This is an awkward first step, and it was a big adjustment for me, a longtime fan of the series, to make.

It only makes sense that Nintendo would follow up on the Switch, with its Joy-Con functionality acting very similar to the Wii remote. Nintendo Switch Sports is the result, a new package that brings back popular sports like bowling and tennis alongside new events like badminton, soccer, volleyball, and chambara.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Like the best social games, Switch Sports is best if you can gather a bunch of friends together to compete for goals, knock each other into the drink in an epic sword duel, and more. And Nintendo has made a habit of committing continuing support to games like this, as it recently added Golf to the Switch Sports repertoire. It's a great little package that scratches the itch that made Wii Sports such a hit.</p><p>\"Playing by myself for an extended period of time was boring and monotonous, and the absence of certain single-player modes is a major oversight,\" Kurt Indovina wrote in GameSpot's<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-sports-review-better-together/1900-6417867/\">Nintendo Switch Sports review</a>. \"But Nintendo Switch Sports is a fantastic multiplayer game that, for the most part, invites anyone and everyone to pick up a controller and flail their limbs about. It has its issues, but they fall away when you have other people to play with and are joyously going toe-to-toe in virtual sports. As with the original Wii Sports, Nintendo Switch Sports finds beauty and fun in simplicity. And bowling is great. Better than real-life bowling.\"</p><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Sports/dp/B09KRK6C82/?tag=gamespotdeals-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:gs-2900-4495|vg:-|st:dtp\">See at Amazon</a> </div></h3></p><br />", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/surprise-metallica-is-now-in-fortnite/1100-6510019/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Surprise!

To begin, players have complained about the \"icy sepia\" tone that the March of the Lich King signature cards took. The next set of Signature cards will now be more coloful, Blizzard explained. Current signature cards display the name across the middle, which some fans have said interferes with the full art effect. Blizzard is fixing this by working on a design which will not interfere with the art. The card frame will also be thinned out to make more room for the art and to prevent confusion concerning whether the frame has any gameplay impact. The post specifies that these changes will be arriving in the next expansion's signature cards, so whether these changes will apply to past cards is still up in the air.</p><p>The post also says that some signature cards have interfered with other goodies, making them something other than a pure bonus. If players obtained a Signature Lor\u2019themar, they missed on a legendary card. The same goes for players who own both a Signature Grand Magister Rommath and the March of the Lich King Tavern Pass. Any player who fits one or both of these criteria will receive one free, random legendary card.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hearthstones-next-expansion-brings-big-changes-to-signature-cards/1100-6510014/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}], "source url": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "source title": "GameSpot"}
