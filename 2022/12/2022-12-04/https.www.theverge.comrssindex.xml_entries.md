  <p id="AvrvPu">It looks like DJI’s getting ready to launch the rumored non-Pro version of its Mini 3 drone. While a set of images <a href="https://twitter.com/JasperEllens/status/1598943543690952704?s=20&amp;t=da9LaV_LGblUvLMvPDjbAA">posted to Twitter</a> by DJI enthusiast Jasper Ellens offer a closeup of the Mini 3’s retail packaging, another user <a href="https://twitter.com/JasperEllens/status/1599136946902642688?s=20&amp;t=M01QLQovZgrjvIbuPnJ7qA">shared</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ShaneScordamag1/status/1599102751526424576?s=20&amp;t=M01QLQovZgrjvIbuPnJ7qA">images</a> of the device already on the shelf at a Best Buy in New Jersey.</p>
<p id="SCiKOW">If the price tag shown in the image of this particular Mini 3 bundle is accurate, the device could cost $859.99 with the Fly More kit, which includes the drone and screen-equipped DJI RC remote controller along with a two-way charging hub, a shoulder bag, extra propellers, and screws. That’s over $200 cheaper than the cost of the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.dji.com%2Fproduct%2Fdji-mini-3-pro%3Fvid%3D113991&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F12%2F4%2F23492829%2Fdji-mini-3-closer-launch-drone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$1,098 Mini 3 Pro</a> with the Fly More combo and the same controller.</p>

  <p id="SEuZDp">A group of 26 Taylor Swift fans are suing Ticketmaster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/15/23460279/taylor-swift-ticketmaster-the-eras-tour-concert-presale-crashed">following last month’s ticketing fiasco</a> that left users unable to buy tickets for Swift’s The Eras Tour (<a href="https://deadline.com/2022/12/ticketmaster-sued-by-taylor-swift-fans-ticketing-debacle-1235188219/">via <em>Deadline</em></a>). In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23334338-taylor-swift-fans-complaint?responsive=1&amp;title=1">a lawsuit submitted</a> to a California court, the fans accuse Ticketmaster’s parent company, LiveNation of “anticompetitive conduct” that let scalpers snap up a surplus of tickets, resulting in higher ticket prices for the fans who could actually get their hands on them.</p>
<p id="roTyct">In addition to alleging that Ticketmaster forces fans to “exclusively” use the service to purchase tickets at prices “above what a competitive market price would be,” the suit claims Ticketmaster also profits off the resale of those tickets through its secondary marketplace.

<p id="Bkd96K">The most notable change is the brand-new island, which includes a number of new points of interest such as a citadel housing a character known as “the Ageless,” a mine full of a new material called kinetic ore, and some kind of abandoned farm.</p>
<p id="PtXZtz">Other additions include a new vehicle in the form of dirt bikes (called a “trail thrasher” in the game), the ability to roll around in a giant snowball, “reality augments” that give you randomized buffs as the match goes on, flying jellyfish that can restore your health, brand-new guns including a rifle that shoots...</p>
