The sentence in question is both a long stretch in prison and a reminder that an author is always at liberty to put his creations on day release. Montgomery has been shut up, a closed book for a while, but here he is, brought back to life, with a new adopted name \u2013 Felix Mordaunt \u2013 and a zippy Sprite sports car in which to explore the world. Things, however, it slowly becomes clear, are not what they used to be.
