This is episode ONE of my series on Japan's VR Culture! I recently got to spend 8 days in Japan where I visit studios from around the country to showcase Japan and what it has to offer in terms of Virtual Reality! 

In this episode I go to Thirdverse, the largest VR only game publisher in Japan; developing games for PCVR and the Quest 2 !

I have a LOT more coming! So excited! In this one I also got to try out new content for Altair Breaker and their newest game, a hero FPS X8.
