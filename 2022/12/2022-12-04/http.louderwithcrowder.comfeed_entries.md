She seems like a sweet old lady... who somehow wandered onto hunting grounds. But someone needs to get these clicks. Why not me? If this was my grandma who did this, I'd expect you to have a few laughs too. (shout out to <a href="https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2022/12/04/woman-tries-to-feed-decoy-ducks-snaps-on-hunters-when-she-realizes-theyre-fake/" target="_blank">Whiskey Riff</a>)</p><p>MeMaw thought she was feeding <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/taliban-duck-boat" target="_blank">ducks</a>. The hunters who put the DECOYS in the water thought they were obvious enough decoys that the woman wouldn't try feeding them. See, when hunters hunt ducks, they use decoys to lure real ducks into the line of fire. The only thing these decoys lured was a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/molotov-cocktail-ukrainian-grandma" target="_blank">sweet old lady</a>... who stopped being sweet once she found out she was feeding dummy ducks.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@kyledixon25/video/7035670975119363375" class="tiktok-embed"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kyledixon25?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="@kyledixon25">@kyledixon25</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7035670826326428462?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Kyle Dixon">♬ original sound - Kyle Dixon</a> </section> </blockquote> </div><p>The hunters tried to explain to MeMaw that the ducks weren't real and that she had managed to wander into the middle of a duck hunt. MeMaw screamed, "You spend all that money just to murder a duck that never did anything to you?"</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="597ab" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32250257&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>The Ducks Bros answered with the only logical response: "We eat them. They're delicious."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="c7398" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32250259&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>That's when MeMaw started to go Mecha-Karen on the Duck Bros</p><p>MECHA-MEMAW: Buy it at Wegmans!</p><p>DUCK BRO #2: Or, I could just do this.</p><p>MECHA-MEMAW:  Because you're a murderer, that's why!<br /></p><p>Funny thing about the ducks on sale at Wegmans? They stop being alive before they are packed up and put on sale at Wegmans. To quote one of the greatest philosophers of this or any other generation, Uncle Ted Nugent, you can't grill it until you kill it.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="4b754" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32250262&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>At least for Mecha-MeMaw Karen, she most likely does not know what a TikTok is. I would hope any grandkids or great-grandkids would have the sense not to show her the video or tell her that the internet is having a laugh at her expense. They should stay quiet sucking on the butterscotch candy she gave them out of her purse, and let her tell her story about how she confronted these mean hunters.</p><p>To the hunters, thank you for remembering to do it for the content. I hope the real ducks were as easily fooled by the decoys. And that you also have a turkey and a chicken in the cooler with some cooking twine and a vivid imagination.</p><p><p>

## James Woods ready to go scorched earth after 'Twitter Files' identifies Democrats targeting him for deletion

Part Two was supposed to drop on Saturday, but they are still being reviewed by independent reporter Bari Weiss. Matt Taibbi was the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-twitter-files" target="_blank">independent journalist who reviewed Part One</a>, and of note is how easy it was for Team Biden and the Democrat National Committee to have tweets removed in bulk. One tweet that the DNC marked for deletion was from actor <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/this-james-woods-tweet-perfectly-sums-up-why-our-cities-are-in-chaos" target="_blank">James Woods</a>.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">9.

Woods, known for being <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/actor-james-woods-response-to-his-agent-dropping-him-is-perfect" target="_blank">outspoken against progressive bullplop</a>, spent a lot of time on Saturday crying havoc and letting loose the tweets of war.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">How is the Twitter Files chicanery any different from Watergate in sum and substance? <br /><br />Nixon resigned when his henchmen tried to subvert free speech. <br /><br />Your turn, Mr. Biden.<br />— James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) <a href="https://twitter.com/RealJamesWoods/status/1598868309025644544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>There could be a lawsuit incoming. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Agree.

The last time Republicans had control, there was many a hearing about Big Tech censorship and no one did a goddamn thing about it. This was when Republicans held both the Senate AND the White House. There were lectures from senators that made for good content and a number of snarky tweets. Yet the heads of the Big Tech companies were told to do little but go back to their platforms and think about what they've done.</p><p>They thought about it, and things have gotten worse. And that was before Elon bought Twitter. As Musk has tried to improve Twitter, Facebook has quadrupled down on throttling content. They'll even go through a year's worth of posts looking for anything they can cite you in violation of. It's happened to us,  and I can't even tell you what. When I tried to on Instagram, the post was deleted within thirty seconds.</p><p>Republicans had the opportunity to do something four years ago. They didn't, and you see what happened. Now it's nut up or shut up time for the GOP. Elon Musk gave us the opening our elected officials had better not waste again.</p><p><p>

## Worlds derpiest fugitive is captured after complaining on Facebook he's not on the sheriff's most wanted list

Respect the law and order... and stay off Facebook. One fugitive did not. And when his feelings were hurt that he didn't make Rockdale County's ten most wanted list, he said something. He's still not on the most wanted list... because he's incarcerated after asking police "what about me?"</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="46ccc" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32249961&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Sheriff's departments have been using their <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sheriff-encourages-citizens-shoot-intruders" target="_blank">Facebook pages </a>to enlist citizens' help in catching the bad guys. Rockdale County, Georiga posts a monthly update on the ten most wanted fugitives of justice. If you happen to see any of these people lurking around a Waffle House or the DWL Dome, please contact the authorities.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"></div><p>Georgia resident (Go Bulldogs) Christopher Spaulding felt a name was missing from this gallery of murderers, rapists, and armed felons. His. Spaulding works hard at being a lowlife. He demands someone give him his roses.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="a7600" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32249965&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>The Rockdale County Sheriff's Department apologized for the oversight and pledged to rectify the situation.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="050be" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32249966&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Spaulding is now behind bars on two warrants for Felony Violation of Probation. Poor fella missed the Bulldogs big win over LSU too.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="10909" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32249967&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>What's sad is Spaulding is not the only person living in the United States of the Americas who is this big of a chucklehead. In 2021, a Tulsa woman responded to a Facebook post about award money for her capture, commenting -- and I quote -- "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/facebook-post-oklahoma-arrrest" target="_blank">where the reward money at</a>?" But in her defense, at least she was looking for paid. This nincompoop was in his feels the sheriff's department wasn't paying enough attention to him.</p><p>They are now. As are the rest of us. We're all laughing at you.</p><p><p>
