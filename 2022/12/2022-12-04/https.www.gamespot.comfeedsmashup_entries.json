The brand-new Shockwave Hammer is a melee weapon that can dish out some hefty damage with each mighty swing, but that's probably not going to be the main reason you pick this one up.

It is an Epic-quality item and is therefore somewhat rare, though they're obviously easier to find at larger POIs that have denser loot pools.

Combined with its main event Game Pass subscription program and day one releases through it, Xbox had plenty of gaming muscle to flex throughout 2022.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On the exclusives side, Xbox's big releases this year comprised of an excellent expansion for Forza Horizon 5, the full release of Grounded, and captivating Pentiment. Focused more on quality over quantity ahead of 2023's big releases in the form of Redfall and Starfield, Xbox gamers filled the gap between console-exclusive releases with a selection of excellent third-party games.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Game Pass provided excellent material such as Persona 5 Royal, Deathloop, and A Plague Tale: Requiem, while the current-gen side of the equation saw Gotham Knights and Marvel's Midnight Suns arrive on Microsoft's pair of powerful consoles.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So which games earned critical acclaim this year through that platform?

More danger, more mystery, and enough rats to push the processing power of an Xbox Series X to its breaking point. The follow-up to one of the biggest surprise hits of 2019, A Plague Tale: Innocence, Requiem doubles down on the somber tone of its predecessor, sharpens its gameplay, and delivers an unforgettable adventure set in a version of 14th century France that pulls no punches.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/a-plague-tale-requiem\">Metascore: 85</a> | Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/a-plague-tale-requiem-review-picturesque-terror/1900-6417981/\">A Plague Tale: Requiem review</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Destiny 2: The Witch Queen</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4067707-destiny2thewitchqueen%281%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Ever since Destiny 2 first launched in 2017, Bungie had been slowly planting seeds for an expansion that would rock the world of its sci-fi sandbox to its very core. With the arrival of the titular Witch Queen, narrative bombshells were dropped, the status quo was rocked, and dangerous secrets were dragged out of the shadows. More than just Destiny's storytelling at its best, The Witch Queen expansion is also a terrific showcase of fresh ideas, polished gameplay, and co-op fun that feels unique to this constantly evolving universe.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/destiny-2-the-witch-queen\">Metascore: 85</a> | Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-witch-queen-review-queens-gambit/1900-6417838/\">Destiny 2: The Witch Queen review</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Tunic</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4067717-tunic%281%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Games inspired by The Legend of Zelda are a dime a dozen these days, but Tunic rises above them to bring out the best in its primary inspiration.

This time around, we haven't just received an exciting new map and some fresh weapons--Epic has introduced game-changing Reality Augments that function like perks for your character. This new system can completely change the flow of a match, so you'll want to know everything you can about which Augments to get and how they work. Don't worry--we've got you covered here.</p><h2>Fortnite Augments list</h2><p>Throughout each match, you'll be given the choice between two random Augments that can help give you a leg up on your competition. The longer you survive, the more Augments you'll be offered. These will last until the end of the match, but they do not carry over into the next game. If you don't like the randomized Augment, you can reroll for a chance at one you do want--but be aware that you only get one free reroll. If you want to keep rerolling, you'll have to spend 100 gold bars each time.</p><p>Like other collections in the game, Augments have their own tab where you can see which ones you've discovered so far. Epic is almost certain to add more Augments in the weeks and months to come, so make sure to check back in the future to see which ones you may not have found yet.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-augments-and-how-they-work/1100-6509692/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-4-map-revealed-new-pois-gameplay-changes-and-more/1100-6509687/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Fortnite Chapter 4 Map Revealed: New POIs, Gameplay Changes, And More", "date_published": "2022-12-04 09:03:00+00:00", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/whats-new-in-fortnite-chapter-4-season-1-motorcycles-the-incredible-hulk-and-more/1100-6509635/\">Fortnite Chapter 4</a> has arrived, and maybe more exciting than anything else is its new map. The new Fortnite map has some touchstones of past maps, like various biomes, a mountain range, and a wintry section that will no doubt be the focal point of the forthcoming winter event. Here's a breakdown of everything we've learned about the new Fortnite Chapter 4 map.</p><h2>New POIs</h2><p>It's a whole new island this season, so naturally there's a lot more to see than just a few new landing spots. Still, a few locales might look familiar if you've been playing Fortnite for a while. The Citadel is a medieval village somewhat like where Geralt of Rivia might pass through--which is perfect since he's in the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-4-season-1-battle-pass-all-skins-emotes-and-other-cosmetics/2900-4492/\">Chapter 4 Season 1 battle pass</a>.</p><p>To the northeast is a snowy section that includes drops such as Brutal Bastion and Lonely Labs. Whose labs? It's hard to say for now, but we'll be investigating it this week, no doubt. Frenzy Fields marks the lush green space of the map, though such visuals extend to Slappy Shores and, to an extent, Faulty Splits, as well.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-4-map-revealed-new-pois-gameplay-changes-and-more/1100-6509687/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-4-season-1-battle-pass-all-skins-emotes-and-other-cosmetics/2900-4492/", "title": "Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 1 Battle Pass: All Skins, Emotes, And Other Cosmetics", "date_published": "2022-12-04 08:35:00+00:00", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4071444-fjhj0vyxwaipzx1%281%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/whats-new-in-fortnite-chapter-4-season-1-motorcycles-the-incredible-hulk-and-more/1100-6509635/\">Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 1</a> is here, and that means a new battle pass filled with 100+ rewards is waiting to be unlocked to the fullest between now and the end of the season. This season's battle pass comes with some hallmarks of the game, namely several stylish original characters, as well as some major new crossovers--this time featuring heroes from two other popular video games. Here we'll be sharing images of every single item in the battle pass so you can check it out while your update downloads, while you're away from your favorite platform, or so you can judge whether it's worth your V-Bucks.</p><p>The biggest character in the Chapter 4 Season 1 battle pass is a matter of opinion, but there are a few likely candidates. The Doomslayer, from id Software's Doom series, finally makes his long-awaited debut, as does Geralt of Rivia, the lead hero of The Witcher games, books, and the Netflix TV series, though the Fortnite skin looks like it's a collaboration that uses CD Projekt Red's particular depiction of the hero. </p><p>For lore hounds, Geno makes his long-awaited debut. The apparent true leader of the Imagined Order, Geno is a character who brings major story ramifications with him, even as we can't definitively say what those are right now. The IO and The Seven have long been at odds, and with The Paradigm maybe decommissioned for the foreseeable future, Geno's side may strike while their foes are shorthanded.</p><p>There are also several original Fortnite characters making their debuts, including another character in a proud line of Epic-made \"goth girls,\" and a guy who really seems excited about the new motorcycles arriving on the island this season.
