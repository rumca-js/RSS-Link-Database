## Ask HN: How would you build a ChatGPT detector?

<p>Like everyone else, I'm blown away by ChatGPT's responses to prompts. At the same time, there's a certain sameiness to the language it produces. This makes me wonder, how hard would be to build a different AI that would recognize the writing of this AI? And how accurate could it get?</p>

## How to work with people who pushback forcefully on team/company standards?

<p>I've worked at a large, famous software company with an academic-inspired workplace and culture for almost 8 years and been fairly successful.<p>Several times in that span, I've worked with people who push back quite forcefully on comments or feedback on topics or practices that have either explicit company standards or at least generally accepted best practices.<p>It seems to me that most people at the company are conflict-avoidant so that when these people push back aggressively, it's often a successful strategy.  Ten minutes of arguing and wearing the other person down saves them 20 minutes of writing unit tests or fixing their code or whatever.  I've seen in the past that these people effectively carve out an unspoken exemption for themselves because everyone is sick of having the same conversation.<p>I'm the tech lead but not manager of my current team and I'm responsible for the technical execution of the team and the success or failure on that level.  There are a bunch of great people who do great work and are pleasant to work with but there's one person who is so unpleasant to work with.  I hate that I have to constantly remind this person of company/team/professional standards and that it feels like every conversation is an argument (examples below).  I hate that this is in my head on the weekend.<p>Questions:<p>- I try as much as possible to explain _why_ practices are what they are, the effects on our project, the team, etc.  Any suggestions for these conversations in the future?<p>- I can't control this person's behavior but I can control my response.  Suggestions for dealing with this personally so I'm not wasting my Sunday thinking/writing about it?<p>- Other thoughts or feedback?<p>Thank you so much in advance!<p>Some examples:
- Sending a large PR that changes many files at once because their changes kept growing in scope as they were trying to figure out how to do something.  Company has lots of guidance about small changes being easier to review, less bug-prone, etc and how to break them up.  I try to emphasize the benefits for the team and codebase, the respect for the reviewer, etc.
Generally get push-back like "What does it matter?", "It's already done.", "It would take too much time to break up.", "I'll do that next time", etc.<p>- Adding unit tests for some piece of logic.  The benefits of unit tests are so fundamental, but I try to emphasize that there are many people working on the codebase, don't want to accidentally introduce bugs, protect that logic for the future, etc.
Generally get push-back like Well it's so simple.  It's not worth testing.  I'll add a test later. etc<p>- On Friday, I discovered a chunk of code copied from Stackoverflow.  It was crappy code, which is what caught my eye in the first place.  Company has clear guidance that if you want to use outside code, we must verify the license and segregate it from owned code.  (If you're curious why: it's hard to know where the SO code originally comes from, maybe copied from a closed-source project or one with GPL license or whatever, and even if it's original to SO, there is a license for that and it wouldn't be considered owned by the company).
I was shocked to receive push-back on this.  The person said things like "how would anyone find out", "what does it matter", "everyone does it", "it's so low risk, who cares"</p>

## Tell HN: The ThinkPad X1 Carbon is an excellent MacBook replacement

<p>If you would like to develop outside of the Apple ecosystem, find Windows clunky, and dislike fiddling with Linux to get it to work on arbitrary hardware, consider the X1 with Fedora. I bought one at the recent Black Friday sale: $1,700 for a 12 Gen i7-1280P, 32GB, 512GB SSD. I love this machine.<p>https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx1/thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-10-(14-inch-intel)/21cbcto1wwus2<p>Physically, it's fantastic. Hats off to the engineers and designers for investing in the tactile experience. They made it lightweight but simultaneously substantial-feeling via rigidity and weight distribution. I now understand why Thinkpad keyboards are so well-regarded. Its trackpad matches Apple's, which is the highest praise I can give. The brilliant screen has an aspect ratio that's as good for building things as for consuming content. And battery life supports hours of binging netflix after compiling a bunch of code.<p>I've been even more pleasantly surprised by the software experience. This is a Linux workstation that "just works." Close the lid, it goes on standby - open, and it resumes instantly. Plug it into a 100Mhz ultrawide monitor via a lightning cable, and not only does it seamlessly extend the desktop at native refresh rates, but it also mounts all the devices that are connected via the monitor's integrated USB hub. I'm able to log in via my bluetooth kinesis keyboard consistently, without hassle. Updates are fast, easy, and tested on the exact hardware I'm using. I've been using it as my daily driver for a week and I've yet to dive down a rabbit-hole of outdated forum advice to get something basic to work.<p>Finally, and more subjectively, Fedora's out-of-the-box experience handily outshines both OSX and Windows. Window-snapping, global search, software installation via a package manager, resource efficiency, containerization support, configuration, etc.<p>I wanted to share here for any others who have tried, and failed, to find a legitimately better-than-Macbook development machine for the past few years.</p>

<p>I’ve gotten to be quite good at the actual coding part after a decade or so of programming. I’m not looking for better code practices, although I’ll obviously still learn and grow there.<p>What I’m seeking is reading material regarding how to manage project scope, be better team member, converting asks to deliverables, managing expectations from management, enabling team members by opening communication channels across teams, time management, etc.<p>Any suggested reading material? Preferably books, but excellent blog posts are welcome.</p>

<p>Seeing the rise of ChatGPT, I am convinced companies will be using this and services like it in the future to drastically reduce the number of engineers needed.<p>Is their a field that has relative job security in computer science that shouldn’t be impacted by similar AI products?<p>I know people will mock me for having these thoughts but I am only 3 years into my career so I already didn’t have the confidence some of the developers on this forum have.<p>Some initial thoughts include pivoting to work on lower level stuff like OS. I am highly motivated and am willing to put on hours. I just fear Im entering a race that I have no odds of finishing.</p>

<p>Hello HN!<p>My primary background is in desktop development and my knowledge of web development is a little rusty by now. I know about Node.JS, Angular, React, Express and the like and have done a few small projects with these technologies. So far, I have implemented the below requirements for each project myself or copied them from previous projects. Now I am looking for a reasonable fullstack framework with the following requirements:<p>- A central definition of data schemas. I don't want to define my schema or validation twice, once in the frontend and once in the backend.<p>- Automatic generation of REST endpoints. I hate boilerplate code and don't want to reimplement Get/GetOne/Add/Update/Delete and Websocket for each data model. Even better would be a GraphQL interface.<p>- Authorization and Authentication<p>- No manual HTTP calls for standard cases. I want to define my model at the server and have the data available in an array at the client. As soon as a client inserts a record in his list I want that automatically a POST with the new record is sent to the server, it verifies the model and the authorization and inserts the record into the database. Then the server notifies the other clients about the change using websockets. The other clients see the new data record in their array without having to write a single manual HTTP call or websocket connection.<p>- Open Source Only. No Firebase or similar.<p>I've been searching for a while, but haven't found anything that seems reasonable. If I don't find anything I will write a small framework myself. I apologize if I seem lazy and don't want to search myself, but I'm really getting desperate. I want to spend as little time as possible on writing boilerplate and instead write business logic. There are thousands of javascript frameworks out there but none of them seem to handle these simple standard cases very well. They all require manual implementation of CRUD for each model or manual data fetching and subscription. Please make suggestions for frameworks and help me to see through the framework jungle!</p>

<p>I've been in the software industry for ~10 years. I no longer feel exciting for anything including the latest ChatGPT. I've already been through these phases: engineering principle for all things -> okay, helping customers is the actual business value, so code is just a tool -> obsessed with [solution,problem] -> well, it's actually mostly about marketing and sale, problems don't actually discover good solutions, mediocre solutions find their way to the problems. Now I see tech is as useful as taking a shower every morning. I no longer feel anything in any role in tech industry.<p>No, I don't think I'm depressed. I eat healthy food, exercise and see mountain and river every morning. My mom loves me.<p>I'm figuring out what's the best mental model to survive (or feel) anything in tech. So you may suggest something outside of tech, I'm already pretty good at many things. But this profession just doesn't feel (or feel at all) right.</p>

## Show HN: Using Vim as an input method editor (IME) for X11 apps

<p>As a Vim user, I often use Vim to write some text and then copy & paste it into another text field of GUI apps (e.g. browsers, chat apps, etc.),
because almost all of these text fields provide only very basic editing functions.<p>A while ago, I came up with an idea: what if we could use Vim as an IME?<p>Ordinary IMEs are used to input some non-English characters, but the essential functions of IME are
1) receiving a keyboard sequence
2) process the key sequence and outputting a text<p>These functions are the same as text editor's.
So I thought implementing an IME that can be used with Vim keybindings could be a good solution for the above problem.<p>After that I learned mechanisms of IME for Linux desktop and tried to develop an experimental IME.</p>
