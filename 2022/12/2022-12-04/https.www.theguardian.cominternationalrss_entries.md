<p>Lions of Teranga fans gathered with cautious optimism, but left with hopes lost and eyes on the next African Cup of Nations</p><p>It was a freezing night in east London, but inside Little Baobab, an inconspicuous Senegalese restaurant hidden away in a building in Clapton, there was cautious buzz of optimism. Usually the venue hosts Senegalese musicians, often playing mbalax, a type of Senegalese and Gambian dance music. But tonight, it was all about the football, with the crowd of 40 or so largely hopeful their team could reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup for just the second time.</p><p>Khadim Mbamba, the restaurant’s chef, refused to sit, but chose instead to lean nervously against a chair at the very back of the room. “Some people have told me Senegal only have a 15% chance of winning,” he said. “I would say 35%. I don’t think there’s going to be many goals, though. 1-0 or 2-1, maybe.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/04/in-a-london-restaurant-senegalese-hold-heads-high-despite-england-disappointment">Continue reading...</a>

<p>England’s midfield sensation was magnificent in difficult moments, a source of control when it was close to the edge</p><p>England’s second goal just before half-time at Al Bayt Stadium, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/04/england-senegal-world-cup-last-16-match-report">the goal that killed this World Cup last-16 tie</a>, was a pure Jude Bellingham moment. Watching the three white England shirts surge and veer like an aerial display team across that wide-open lozenge of green, it almost felt like a moment of show-Bellingham, a gloss to go with all the close-quarter moments in between, the moments of graft that had kept England in this game in its early stages.</p><p>This, though, was pure cinema. England had been flat at times in the first half against Senegal, had seemed to be playing with a tension headache. But they were 1-0 up when Bellingham picked the ball up forty yards from his own goal, shrugged his way into space, and looked up. You could almost hear the whirr of maths being crunched, lanes and distances overlaid, prelude to a moment of calculated abandon as Bellingham surged for the open space, sensing the tender point in front of him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/dec/04/jude-bellinghams-moment-of-cinema-makes-us-wonder-where-this-might-go">Continue reading...</a>

For Olivier Giroud, now France’s all-time male record goalscorer, it was the red of Froges Olympique Club, whose clubhouse 20km from Grenoble in south-east France is appropriately decorated for the World Cup. For Kylian Mbappé, the man who will surely overtake him, it was the green of AS Bondy, a team in a northern suburb of Paris. Even on Giroud’s big night, the masterful and electric Mbappé was able to muscle in on the headlines as France advanced to the quarter-finals.</p><p>For Mbappé, a superstar aged 23 and already a world champion, only another 20 goals to go.

<p>State media distance themselves from claim ‘morality police’ have been shut down after Mahsa Amini death</p><p>Protesters in Iran have called for a three-day strike this week amid conflicting reports that its “morality police” had been shut down, and as the US said the leadership in Tehran had locked itself into a “vicious cycle” that had cut it off from its own people and the international community.</p><p>The call steps up pressure on Iranian authorities after the attorney general said this weekend that the morality police – whose detention of a young woman triggered months of protests – had been shut down. There was no confirmation of the closure from the interior ministry, which is in charge of the morality police, and Iranian state media said the attorney general, Mohammad Jafar Montazeri, was not responsible for overseeing the force.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/04/iranian-protesters-call-for-three-day-strike-as-pressure-on-regime-builds">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Goals were easy to come by for Manchester City as they continued their eye-catching home form against Brighton and moved within six points of the leaders, Chelsea. Chloe Kelly played a starring role as Gareth Taylor’s side cruised to victory, deepening Brighton’s troubles at the bottom of the table. An early own goal from Veatriki Sarri sent City on their way before Julie Blakstad and Laura Coombs added to the first-half goal tally. Brighton pulled a goal back at the very end with Lee Geum-min turning it home.</p><p>City have been somewhat flying under the radar in the title chase this season but their form has been noteworthy. Plenty of turnover in the summer and injury issues saw disruption early on, but Taylor’s side, unbeaten since September, are evidently heading in the right direction. With the league’s joint top scorer in Bunny Shaw spearheading their attack, City have made the Academy Stadium a fortress, winning the last eight at home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/04/manchester-city-brighton-womens-super-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I got very close to becoming a European Space Agency astronaut, but the final lesson was a bittersweet one</p><p>In February 2021, the European Space Agency (Esa) announced it would be recruiting a new astronaut class, the first since 2008. It encouraged applicants from a broader spectrum of gender, physical ability, age and ethnicity, so I fired off an application and joined a WhatsApp group of like-minded hopefuls. There were 23,000 applicants in total, and some obvious criteria. To get on to the longlist you had to have a couple of degrees in science, preferably in different disciplines, with at least one at master’s level or above. As for the other qualities that might make a good astronaut, we didn’t know precisely what they were looking for, but we could guess: they seem to like people who are outdoorsy, a bit sporty, good in teams and able to put up with quite a lot of discomfort.</p><p>Above all, they seemed to prefer people who had what they called “operational experience”, which meant pursuits where you made real decisions with some skin in the game, preferably your own. I made both the longlist of 17,000 applicants, and the smaller group of close to 1,500 who went on to the next stage in Hamburg, Germany. We did classroom tests and video games: maths and physics quizzes, some psychometric screening and a bunch of fiendishly difficult pilot aptitude tests. My childhood bashing away on an Atari 2600 hadn’t gone to waste. And the competitors in the room were no slouches: intrepid oceanographers, particle physicists, military test pilots and Antarctic explorers, to list but a few.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/04/astronaut-european-space-agency-stars">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A brush with Australia defender Aziz Behich sparked ‘La Pulga’ into life as the Albiceleste booked a place in the last eight</p><p><em>Oh, Aziz. You’ve done it now</em>. The second it happened, Argentina’s players knew there was only one way this was going to end. Anyone who has watched Lionel Messi a lot did, and there has been a lot of him to watch. By the time they left the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium, scene of his 1,000th game, his teammate Alexis Mac Allister was laughing about it, the apparent inevitability of it all. Australia had picked the wrong guy: that’s not a knife, <em>this</em> is a knife.</p><p>There were 10 minutes to go until half-time, there had been little sign of a breakthrough, and Messi had given the ball away the last two times he had it, when he and Aziz Behich clashed out on the right touchline. The Dundee United player barged him, grabbed his shirt and had a word or five. Shortly after he also gave away a free-kick, for a foul on Alejandro Gómez. Messi took the free-kick, fast.

This means poignant introspection on the confines of gargantuan fame. “I wanna be human ’fore I do some art”, he refrains gruffly on the plush, soulful keys of Yun, which features none other than Erykah Badu. Or, he offers in Korean, “I wanna be free of this canvas frame”, on Still Life, a particularly irresistible, glossy slice of pop with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/13/anderson-paak-people-are-like-damn-how-are-you-not-on-crack-cocaine-right-now">Anderson .Paak</a>.</p><p>There’s an exuberant headto head with Korean rap veteran Tablo, and twee softness on No 2, where RM tells himself to stop looking back. The production gleams – take the rippling sweetness of Closer, or the crunchy abrasiveness of Change Pt 2. RM’s delivery at best is boisterous, sometimes taut as elastic, elsewhere a slick rasp (his singing voice is less striking, though no less full of feeling). Some moments fall flat – Lonely is cloying, paint-by-numbers EDM-pop that doesn’t fully land.

<p>Resolute mayors and angry MPs have a new confident voice – and they will use it to make the Tories’ empty words a reality</p><p>A cold realisation is haunting British politics. For at least six years, turbulence and chaos were the default setting of power and politics. Now, the arrival of Rishi Sunak’s comparatively dull brand of Tory technocracy feels like an uneasy pause, allowing us to marvel at the contrast between a long spell of drama and noise, and the country’s everyday reality. Put bluntly, we are back where we ever were, and few aspects of our national condition better illustrate that than the gap between England’s north and south.</p><p>Yes, the usual caveats apply: inequality, poverty and decaying public services are problems spread around the whole of the country, and London presents examples as glaring as anywhere else. But the north-south divide remains the most vivid manifestation of the English malaise, and the serial crises we now seem to be locked into are making it much worse. At the same time, however, reducing the north’s condition to hapless misery misses a growing confidence and coherence that the chaos of the past few years only seems to have increased. Although levelling up has largely turned out to be a fantasy, our politics might just be showing signs of being radically changed by northern voices, speaking not just for the places they represent and govern, but the wider region.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/04/north-of-england-westminster-mayors-tories-levelling-up">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tech billionaires seem intent on giving away a lot of money. But are those who support ‘effective altruism’ ignoring the very real problems of today?</p><p>In the past few weeks a photograph of Tony Blair and his buddy Bill Clinton sharing a panel with a scruffy kid wearing a T-shirt, baggy shorts and trainers has been doing the rounds. The April event was in the Bahamas and funded by an outfit called FTX – a supposedly “user-friendly crypto exchange” – owned by the scruffy kid, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF from now on). Blair and Clinton are looking very pleased to be there, providing confirmation of the aphrodisiac effect of great wealth, because the lad who was playing host was apparently as rich as Croesus, or at any rate <a href="https://www.commonsense.news/p/the-32-billion-crypto-scammer">worth $32bn</a>.</p><p>And this was real wealth, it seemed. After all, the venture capitalists at Sequoia – who had backed Silicon Valley success stories such as Google and PayPal – had given him the green light (as well as some of their investors’ money). A few months after Blair and Clinton made their pilgrimage to the sun-soaked and regulation-lite Bahamas, one of Sequoia’s partners offered a <a href="https://archive.ph/2022.11.10-002447/https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/sam-bankman-fried-spotlight/#selection-735.0-735.231">breathless endorsement</a> of SBF and his crypto exchange. “Of the exchanges that we had met and looked at”, she wrote, “some of them had regulatory issues, some of them were already public. And then there was Sam.” And FTX, which, Sequoia felt, was “Goldilocks-perfect”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2022/dec/04/longtermism-rich-effective-altruism-tech-dangerous">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The author’s vividly realised new novel uses a country house setting to explore scientific puzzles and the nature of reality</p><p>There is often a sense, reading <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-banville">John Banville</a>, that there’s little he doesn’t know about the competing ironies of truth-telling and fiction. He has long enjoyed a brilliant gift for constructing word-made worlds replete with all home comforts and then allowing you to see the joins. <em>The Singularities</em>, his 20th novel under his own name, is something of a definitive articulation of his mastery of those dark arts, as well as another enjoyable quest into the ways in which we make sense of the world through make-believe.</p><p>It begins with a rhetorical question about all the above: “Yes, he has finished his sentence, but does that mean he has nothing more to say?” The “he”, we discover, is Freddie Montgomery, murderous protagonist of Banville’s 1989 novel <em>The Book of Evidence</em>. The sentence in question is both a long stretch in prison and a reminder that an author is always at liberty to put his creations on day release. Montgomery has been shut up, a closed book for a while, but here he is, brought back to life, with a new adopted name – Felix Mordaunt – and a zippy Sprite sports car in which to explore the world. Things, however, it slowly becomes clear, are not what they used to be. This is not only a factor of the arrested time and space of incarceration – “prison had winnowed out the profusion of things, but now he was to be thrown back into the middle of the muddle” – but also a reflection of his creator’s restless vocation. Banville has imagined many other worlds since 1989, as his villain is now free to discover.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/04/the-singularities-by-john-banville-review-theoretical-physics-meets-playful-storytelling">Continue reading...</a>

Porcini risotto, chicken cacciatore, and bread and butter pudding – butter is an everyday luxury that adds a mellow sweetness to these comforting dishes<p>We are never without butter at home, as essential to us as dried oregano, garlic, tomato sauce, capers and olive oil. My wife has been known to melt a pat of Jersey butter for flapjacks, and my children eat it like cheese on the endless rounds of toast they clamour for each morning. Everyday luxury.</p><p>Butter is a staple of northern Italian cooking, used much more than in the south. Historically the fat of choice for the wealthy, its rich, mellow sweetness is in the elevated fine pasta served with white truffles, and also crucial in risotto. What is poetically described by Elizabeth David as “a walnut of butter”, added towards the end of something home-cooked with everyday ingredients, makes it the hug one needs at this time of year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/dec/04/joe-trivelli-comforting-winter-butter-recipes">Continue reading...</a>

There’s absolutely no need to read on.” For news organisations thirsty for attention, this seemed like a perverse strategy.</p><p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> appeared to have fully embraced this approach, reporting that “young people are shunning Christmas carols for more modern festive songs”.

<p>The deficiencies on display throughout USA’s defeat to the Dutch suggest that more work was needed before Gregg Berhalter’s squad arrived in Qatar</p><p>As his players slumped to the ground after full-time at Khalifa International Stadium, their World Cup dreams in pieces, US head coach Gregg Berhalter took to the pitch brandishing his Moleskine notebook. As he moved through the throng – wrapping his arm around a weeping Tim Weah, offering words of consolation to Christian Pulisic, applauding the American fans – the notebook stayed with him, held aloft seemingly as a symbol of the task that lies ahead if the US are to progress any further than this at their home World Cup in 2026.

Let me try the cinnamon, pear and walnut, I thought, surely that will be awful and I can stop this madness. Nope. Amazing.

There’s also the Elvis (redskin peanuts, dried banana); the Turkish (coffee, rose, pistachio); and Raspanise (almonds, star anise, raspberry pate de fruit).

There are some obvious parallels between the tsunami of industrial action that engulfed the Callaghan government and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/01/the-month-in-uk-strikes-a-calendar-of-decembers-planned-stoppages" title="">waves of strikes</a> surging towards Rishi Sunak. Now, as then, public sector employees are in the van of workers trying to maintain the real value of their incomes at a time of galloping inflation. Now, as then, ministers are rejecting claims for better pay on the grounds that the country cannot afford the demands. Now, as then, the result is an escalating conflict between government and unions that paralyses vital services and disrupts day-to-day life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/04/winter-of-discontent-harden-feeling-tories-have-broken-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Choose the right plants to get the best from mini landscapes</p><p>Getting together in the pub with my houseplant-mad mates, the conversation quickly turned to what indoor gardening trends we predict will unfold in the future. While there was some pretty fiery debate over some predictions (yes, this is what us botanists do in the pub), the one thing we were all unanimous on was that the fascination with terrariums was not just here to stay, but going to expand.</p><p>The one risk, however, is that so much advice on making terrariums –particularly online – is wildly inaccurate, and this can set newbies up for failure. As most of this misinformation centres on plant choice, I thought I’d introduce the best plant I have so far seen for terrarium culture, somewhat overlooked in the UK.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/04/love-in-a-microclimate-terrarium-success">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Joely Mbundu and Pablo Schils are remarkable as two young west African migrants in Belgium, fighting for survival in the Dardenne brothers’ latest Cannes-feted release</p><p>Belgian film-makers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne have long been darlings of the Cannes film festival, with prizes including Palme d’Or wins for <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/24/tori-and-lokita-review-clarity-of-purpose-in-the-dardennes-parable-of-the-dispossessed">Rosetta</a> </em>(1999) and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/mar/10/1">The Child</a></em> (2005), best screenplay for <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/30/silence-lorna-review-dardenne">The Silence of Lorna</a> </em>(2008), a Grand Prix for <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/25/kid-with-bike-review-dardenne">The Kid With a Bike</a></em> (2011) and best director honours for <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/20/young-ahmed-review-dardenne-brothers">Young Ahmed </a></em>(2019). As for their most recent feature, <em>Tori and Lokita</em>, which once again finds these masters of humanist film-making addressing the plight of young people, it took the special 75th anniversary prize when it premiered at Cannes in May. It’s an extraordinary run of accolades from what remains, for better or worse, the world’s most celebrated film festival – a reminder that over the course of three decades the Dardennes have quietly proved themselves remarkable documenters of the human condition.</p><p>Screen newcomers Pablo Schils and Joely Mbundu are utterly engaging as Tori and Lokita, a young boy and a teenage girl from Africa attempting to make a new life in Belgium. We meet Lokita face-on in an interview with an offscreen immigration officer who is sceptical about her claim that Tori is her younger brother. “When my mother died,” Lokita explains hesitantly, “my uncle said it was my brother’s fault; that he still had a sorcerer’s powers and had to be killed. We hid. Then we left.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/04/tori-and-lokita-review-dardenne-brothers-young-west-african-migrants-in-belgium">Continue reading...</a>

When Russia invaded Ukraine, a key part of its strategy was to destroy historic libraries in order to eradicate the Ukrainians’ sense of identity. But Putin hadn’t counted on the unbreakable spirit of the country’s librarians<p>The morning that Russian bombs started falling on Kyiv, Oksana Bruy woke up worried about her laptop. Bruy is president of the Ukrainian Library Association and, the night before, she hadn’t quite finished a presentation on the new plans for the Kyiv Polytechnic Library, so she had left her computer open at work. That morning, the street outside her house filled with the gunfire of Ukrainian militias executing Russian agents. Missile strikes drove her into an underground car park with her daughter, Anna, and her cat, Tom. A few days, later she crept back into the huge empty library, 15,000sqft once filled with the quiet murmurings of readers. As she grabbed her laptop, the air raid siren sounded and she rushed to her car.</p><p>Thanks to that computer, Bruy could work. She didn’t return to her office; instead, she fled west to Lviv. “In all that time, from the first day of the full-scale war, I did not stop working,” she says. The library’s IT specialist lived in the neighbourhood. He kept the servers running and the employees connected. “So there was not a single day’s break in the work of the Kyiv Polytechnical Library, all this time, from 24 February.” The Russians have not shut her down. Oksana Bruy is winning her battle in the Ukrainian war. The libraries are open.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/04/our-mission-is-crucial-meet-the-warrior-librarians-of-ukraine">Continue reading...</a>

A quick stock take of the carriage reveals the following: one Filipino woman from Hong Kong in a Spain shirt and baseball cap; two Japanese women in face masks talking to two Nepalese friends (one of whom flew to Qatar just for the game), both wearing Japan kits; three Korean-Americans searching for tickets; a family of Mexicans (a sombrero gives it away) rooting for Spain; three rowdy Saudi Arabia supporters; and above the door a calling card from the Argentinians who are never far away – a Panini sticker of Diego Maradona from USA 94.</p><p>It was an unlikely combination, but not an unusual one in the city these past few weeks and here’s the argument: the Doha Metro is the place to be at this World Cup.

## The big picture: Bill Brandt’s windows into the mind

<p>The Anglo-German photographer’s evocative 1955 portrait typifies the tension he created between person and place</p><p>Bill Brandt’s first book, <em>The English at Home</em>, published in 1936, exhibited a brilliant fascination not only with light and shade, but with the costumes of class divide – miners’ caps and public school boaters, maids’ pinnies and cricket whites. By the 1950s, however, his English interiors had tended to do away with clothing. His postwar series of nudes found ways of making flesh both sensual and abstract; his camera always seemed as interested in the rooms in which his models lived as in their bodily presence.</p><p>This picture, included in the current Tate Britain exhibition of Brandt’s work, is a celebrated example of that tension. The contours of the girl’s face lend her a sculptural quiet; the darkness of her single visible eye lies in contrast to the pair of windows staring out from the frame, one open, one shut. Light crashes in. Squint a little at the chest of drawers and the girl disappears into the setting entirely; focus on her and the rest becomes a place of her <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> imagining.</p><p><a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/bill-brandt">Bill Brandt: Inside the Mirror is at Tate Britain until 15 January 2023</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/dec/04/the-big-picture-windows-into-the-mind-bill-brandt-portrait-of-a-young-girl">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I came through the other side’: Kathy Burke on depression, the menopause and her ‘fantasy funerals’ podcast

<p>Despite bringing us many of our funniest TV moments, Kathy Burke has faced some dark and troubling times. Here, she talks to Sophie Heawood about solving her problems, the joy of young people, and why we should all ‘laugh at death’</p><p>When I meet Kathy Burke, in a recording studio in north London, she is talking about how much she loves young people and their desire to improve things – their life force. She can’t bear oldies like John Cleese “complaining about wokeness because he doesn’t get it. It’s because you’re old.” she says. “You’ve had your time, it was great, now fuck off! Why this need to remain relevant?” At 58, having already enjoyed a huge career, first as a comic actor and now as a director, Burke has “a lot of hope for young people. Once us old cunts have gone.”</p><p>All of which makes it more surprising that we are actually here to talk about death, and specifically a new podcast that Burke has surprised even herself by launching, called <em>Where There’s a Will There’s a Wake</em>, in which she talks to her comedy friends about how they would like to die. Dawn French, James Acaster and Stewart Lee, among other guests, go deep in what Burke describes as her “fantasy football” version of death and funeral planning.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/dec/04/kathy-burke-interview-depression-menopause-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

In acting as a conveyor belt to the most sought-after jobs, many schools shut out more able young people<p>Meritocracy is one of society’s most powerful myths. It is comforting to believe we live in a fair world where people are rewarded for a mixture of talent and effort. But Britain remains an elitist country in which a socially stratified education system funnels those born to privilege into the highest-status jobs, while holding back children born to parents who have never benefited from such opportunities.</p><p>So Keir Starmer’s pledge to remove the charitable status of private schools, and requiring them to charge VAT on fees, is a welcome move. Just 7% of children <a href="https://www.suttontrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Social-Mobility-%E2%80%93-Past-Present-and-Future-final-updated-references.pdf" title="">attend private schools</a>. Yet privately educated young people make up almost one in three undergraduates at the country’s most selective universities. In the jobs market, the <a href="https://www.suttontrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Elitist-Britain-2019.pdf" title="">figures are even worse</a>: seven out of 10 members of the judiciary were privately educated as were six out of 10 civil service permanent secretaries, more than half of diplomats and more than four in 10 senior media editors. This is not a product simply of their raw ability, but also of the vast resources that go into their education, the social connections and favours it opens up and the other forms of cultural capital it endows.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/04/observer-view-labours-pledge-to-remove-private-schools-charitable-status">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Kremlin says Russia ‘will not accept’ a price cap on its oil after EU members agree on one, while president Volodymyr Zelenskiy says the cap will do little to deter Russia</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">See all our Ukraine war coverage</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Russia “will not accept” a price cap on its oil</strong> and is analysing how to respond, the Kremlin said in comments reported on Saturday, in response to a deal by western powers aimed at limiting a key source of funding for its war in Ukraine. The price cap on Russian seaborne oil was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/03/g7-countries-and-australia-to-cap-price-of-seaborne-russian-oil">adopted by the G7 and Australia</a>, after it was agreed by EU countries.</p><p><strong>President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the $60 price</strong> cap on seaborne Russian oil is not serious and will do little to deter Russia from waging war in Ukraine. “It’s only a matter of time before stronger tools will have to be used anyway. It is a pity that this time will be lost,” he said in a video statement on Saturday.</p><p><strong>US treasury secretary Janet Yellen said</strong> <strong>the cap</strong> will particularly benefit low- and medium-income countries that have borne the brunt of high energy and food prices. “The price cap will immediately cut into (President Vladimir) Putin’s most important source of revenue,” Yellen said in a statement.</p><p>Russia’s embassy in the US criticised what it called the “dangerous” western move and said Moscow would continue to find buyers for its oil.</p><p><strong>US defense secretary Lloyd Austin on Saturday accused Russia of “deliberate cruelty”</strong> in its war in Ukraine, saying Moscow was intentionally targeting civilians. “With deliberate cruelty, Russia is putting civilians and civilian targets in its gunsights,” Austin told the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California.</p><p><strong>Ukraine is slapping sanctions on 10 senior clerics</strong> linked to a pro-Moscow church on the grounds they agreed to work with Russian occupation authorities or justified Moscow’s invasion, the security service said on Saturday.
