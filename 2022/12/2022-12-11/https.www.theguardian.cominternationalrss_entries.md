<p>Never mind the murder investigation: the will-they won’t-they relationship between the two detectives is the beating heart of this Robert Galbraith (AKA JK Rowling) adaptation</p><p>Another Sunday night, another crime drama based on a series of novels. Ah, but Strike (BBC One) cannot be like the others, because of the books’ author. Published under the name Robert Galbraith, the Strike stories have been automatic No 1 bestsellers ever since it was revealed that Galbraith is Harry Potter creator JK Rowling. This fifth season of Strike, based on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/15/troubled-blood-by-robert-galbraith-review-a-cosy-blast-from-the-past">fifth book</a> Troubled Blood, has fans and detractors awaiting it with a fervour other TV whodunnits do not tend to provoke.</p><p>If your only interaction with the Galbraith books is a biennial glance at the headlines they generate, be informed that Rowling’s growing tendency to reiterate political disagreements via her characters is toned right down on TV. Troubled Blood is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/sep/15/rowling-troubled-blood-thriller-robert-galbraith-review">the one that was accused of transphobia</a> when it was published in 2020, but that subplot – a serial killer wears women’s clothing to gain access to his victims, evoking the claim by “gender-critical” campaigners that abusive men will invade women’s spaces if transgender rights are upheld – is barely present here, and was not very prominent in the book anyway.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/11/strike-troubled-blood-review-the-shows-real-hook-will-robin-and-strike-finally-get-together">Continue reading...</a>

I think of this playful, goofy man who would sing me and my sister To Bed, To Bed, To Bed, said Sleepyhead, a bedtime song he learned in the Bahamas. Then there was this aeroplane game, where he’d pick us up one at a time, fly us around the house, and at the end, pretend to dunk our heads in the toilet. We’d laugh and scream and he’d hug us tight. That was the heart of who my dad was.</p><p>Only in my teens did I start to take in the magnitude of who he was and what he did; as a kid, when he was on screen, I just thought it was funny. As I got older, I started to get a very deep appreciation for the career choices that he made, such as being in a scene where he’s kissing a white woman in the back of a cab in <em>Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner</em>. That film resonated with me particularly because my mom [Canadian actor Joanna Shimkus] is white, and her name is also Joanna [like Poitier’s girlfriend, played by Katharine Houghton]. As a child, it felt like watching my parents’ love story, but as I matured I realised how brave it was to tell that story in the mid-1960s when interracial marriage was still illegal in many states.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/11/obituaries-2022-sidney-poitier-remembered-by-sydney-tamiia-poitier">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Gate, Dublin</strong> <br />Pam Gems’ play may have dated, but the tragic arc of Édith Piaf from street urchin to torch singer is still compelling, told through music that rings with drama</p><p>Edith Piaf’s rise from singing on Paris streets to selling out Carnegie Hall is one of the great legends of musical stardom. In Des Kennedy’s staging of Pam Gems’ bio-musical, the focus is on the singer’s decline and fall, her troubled life and early death. Piaf is centre stage throughout, in a role split between Zara Devlin as the gifted young urchin, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/camille-o-sullivan">Camille O’Sullivan</a> as the fully formed artist.</p><p>While Gems’ play has not aged well, it provides a framework for 24 songs, linked to Piaf’s life story, which is sketchily told. With the exception of Marlene Dietrich (Aoife Mulholland) advising Piaf to focus on her technique, and Toine (Kate Gilmore), Piaf’s buddy from the streets of Belleville, the other characters are flimsy, with fine actors such as Rory Nolan and Phelim Drew underused. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/02/camille-osullivan-review-high-energy-mischief-with-flashes-of-magic">O’Sullivan</a>, a dazzling musical interpreter in her solo shows, seems constrained by the role, her instinct for improvisation perhaps hampered by the need to impersonate such a vocally distinctive and well documented artist as Piaf.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/dec/11/piaf-review-camille-osullivan-gate-dublin">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Despite World Cup heartbreak against France, nobody is better qualified to lead England into Euro 2024 than the current manager</p><p>The first thing to say is that Gareth Southgate has not outstayed his welcome.

There can no be recriminations, no anger, no calls for root-and-branch reform; all there is, in the cold light of day, is the bitterness of knowing that England went toe to toe with the world champions, used the right tactics and came up short only because Harry Kane’s nerve betrayed him at the worst possible moment.</p><p>It hurts. “Maybe it was because England were very good,” Didier Deschamps said when he was asked why France spent so much of the game on the back foot. The France coach was under no illusions. Deschamps knew how close England had run the defending champions. Bukayo Saka and Jude Bellingham were irrepressible in attack, Declan Rice outstanding in midfield, Kyle Walker tireless against Kylian Mbappé.

## As Britain’s workers reach their limits, the government has no option but to negotiate | John Harris

<p>Essential workers from nurses to railway staff have had enough – and the Tories will soon realise union-bashing isn’t the answer</p><p>As the huge wave of winter strikes grinds on, the government seems to be suffering from the political equivalent of snow blindness.<strong> </strong>The general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing says she’ll “<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/business/government-to-ignore-nurses-offer-to-press-pause-on-strikes-for-pay-talks-b2243062.html">press pause</a>” on her members’ imminent walk-outs if ministers will finally talk about pay, but at the time of writing, the response was still a kind of trite obstinacy:<strong> </strong>by way of adding insult to injury, Sunday saw the health secretary signalling that although that he still won’t get involved in salary negotiations, he may be able to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/britains-new-lockdown-strikes-bring-country-to-a-standstill-2fm6rwkvx">help with free parking</a> for NHS staff.<strong> </strong>The big fear haunting Rishi Sunak and his colleagues is obvious – if they talk money with the nurses, who will be next?<strong> </strong>The RMT’s Mick Lynch, who recently <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/business/business-news/rail-union-boss-mick-lynch-calls-for-urgent-meeting-with-prime-minister-b1046259.html">called for a one-to-one meeting</a> with the prime minister, knows the answer to that. And so the whole awful drama continues, revealing not just fury and fear at the top, but the government’s collective bafflement.</p><p>A maddening thought is clearly rattling around Tory minds: this wasn’t supposed to happen, was it? Over four decades have passed since Margaret Thatcher began her war on organised labour. Six years ago, the newly elected Tory government led by David Cameron passed a Trade Union Act whose stringent new restrictions on strike action looked like the belated conclusion to what she had started.<strong> </strong>And yet here we are, faced with what the Daily Mail calls a “calendar of chaos”, with the unions suddenly at the centre of the national conversation.</p><p>John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/11/britain-workers-government-nurses-railway-union">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Mount Westmore/MNRK Music Group) <br />The west coast rap supergroup’s album works reasonably well at times, but there are more misses than hits</p><p>Last October, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, E-40 and Too $hort released not-bad bop Big Subwoofer, its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiXwx0NG0Q">camper-than-panto video</a> showing the west coast rap supergroup <a href="https://mountwestmore.com/">Mount Westmore</a> flying into space to… stage an am-dram <em>Avatar</em> sequel in a strip club? It was never quite clear. Distressingly, they tried to parlay the limited artistic gains of that debut single into a summer album, <em>Bad MFs</em>, which appeared “on the blockchain” (honestly, no idea) and is proffered here with a worse name and tracklisting. Its lush, soul-stroked title track is gone, while the drab, misanthropic Have a Nice Day (Fuck You) remains.</p><p>Their four quite different flows still work reasonably well together, from $hort’s lubricious bars to Cube’s truculent pugilism, over comfort-zone beats of electro, P-funk and other familiar 1980s grooves. Yet harmless nostalgia predictably succumbs to charmless bluster. Up &amp; Down is the nadir, wherein our four elderly chums become obsessed with watching a “thicc” woman (wife, mother, daughter or stripper, it’s again unclear) struggling to put on jeans because of the size of her thighs.

<p>Romantic victimhood allows us to believe we’re forever the wounded party – and that men are incapable of change</p><p>There is a genre in ascendancy at the moment that I’ve labelled “romantic victimhood”. Content that falls within this category – ranging from literary screeds to TikTok confessionals – only ever characterises the players in two roles: villain or victim.</p><p>The villain is always a man. It is usually a man in a relationship with a woman, although sometimes it is a man dating a man. Nevertheless: man = villain. The victim is his romantic interest. They recount his behaviour, with the benefit of hindsight, and detail upsetting incidents, usually ones where they felt slighted in some way. These are typically imparted in the register now employed to describe a harm, which combines sombre, stark delivery with therapeutic jargon. The harm is not anything as easily categorisable as outright abuse, or sexual assault. It is a hurt, perhaps one of many, that have added up to create an ultimately “bad relationship”.</p><p>Moya Lothian-McLean is a contributing editor at Novara Media</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Dickey plays Faye, a widow camped out by the side of a Colorado lake, eking out a stripped-back existence of birdwatching, boiling up coffee and catching crawfish. The vast potential of the wild and limitless landscape is mirrored in miniature in Faye’s life. She’s at a turning point. On a whim she sent a letter to her first love, Lito (Studi).

For a moment you don’t know whether to expect her expert medical opinion or a punchline. A patient on the intensive care ward was in desperate need of a dialysis machine – without it, Licari thought, he would be unlikely to survive the night. She had spent almost an hour talking to him, empathising, trying to explain that this was life-saving treatment. But the man refused: he was exhausted and distressed, and wanted to go home.</p><p>“At a certain point, I realised I was losing him,” says Licari. So she tried something different – she cracked a joke. The man laughed, then was quiet. Licari accepted defeat. She told him that she respected his decision and went to leave. But the patient called after her. He’d changed his mind. He would stay and have the treatment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/11/did-you-hear-the-one-about-the-doctor-who-went-into-standup">Continue reading...</a>

A deep cross on their rounded side will stop them exploding and expose their flesh to the heat. This is how I cook them for eating as they are, not worrying about removing the brown skin. They are hard work, though, if you intend to purée them or use them in a dessert. I always turn to the ready-made purée and vacuum-packed whole nuts. They can be folded into a Christmas nut loaf, tossed with the aromatics of a pot-roast bird or into the filling of a chocolate tart or cake.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/dec/11/nigel-slater-recipes-red-leaves-warm-cheese-and-chestnuts-chocolate-chestnut-cake">Continue reading...</a>

Portia (Haley Lu Richardson), the Gen Z assistant to Tanya, Jennifer Coolidge’s impeccably played “psycho” boss, is top of many viewers list. Just out of college, whiny and addicted to doomscrolling on social media, she feels relatable, albeit a bit confused. Also receiving its share of the vitriol? Portia’s wardrobe.</p><p>From the outset, Portia’s clothes make her look out of place. Against the grandeur of the hotel she wears a knitted sweater vest covered in swans, paired with awkward length denim shorts. Her look jars even further when viewed alongside her employer, Tanya who wears a tight fitting floral printed dress from Dolce &amp; Gabbana. Portia uses a backpack while Tanya carries the same bag throughout each episode, a bright pink Valentino shoulder bag with a noticeable gold logo.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/dec/11/what-the-white-lotus-gets-wrong-with-portias-gen-z-wardrobe">Continue reading...</a>

Veronica Ryan is the ‘oldest ever winner’ at 66.

There is something universally cheery and comforting about the phrase “oldest ever winner” – designed to put a glint in the middle-aged eye and send lapsed artists everywhere rifling through drawers for their box of watercolours. (Could they still have a chance?) It is quite different, for example, from the dreadful phrase “youngest ever winner”, designed only to panic contemporaries, wind up their parents, and send everyone else into despair.</p><p>The old are a relatively new discovery for the Turner prize. Between 1991 and 2016 it had an age limit of 50, to encourage younger emerging artists. But if young artists once needed special encouragement, it is not at all clear they do now. In the visual arts, in playwriting, in literary fiction, in music, we seem to have nothing but young emerging artists. The most celebrated literary stars of the last decade have mostly been women in their late 20s and early 30s; the clutch of playwrights now dominating the London scene look like they could comfortably stage their own production of <em>Bugsy Malone</em>. The art magazine <em>Apollo</em> limits its annual lists of “the most inspiring artists, collectors and thinkers” to those under 40, while prizes and grants available to visual artists fairly bristle with “under 35” stipulations – as do those for writers. This year’s Booker shortlist had a 20-year-old on it.

Learning left-handed hand-writing is a tricky business – and my four-year-old is not impressed with my demonstrations<p>‘Try birdy,’ I say, gently, as my son struggles with his writing. He finds writing a bit fiddly, particularly how to hold his pencil. ‘Birdy,’ I’ve discovered, is the term his school use for the tripod of thumb, index and middle finger used to hold the nib in place. Trying to get my son to master it serves as yet another reminder of how many deviously complex things we make kids learn so young.</p><p>‘I can’t,’ he says, proving that his father’s tendency to give up the moment things get too difficult is a genetic trait. I can’t blame him. I’ve been talking about how to hold a pencil for so long now I’m actively forgetting how to do so myself. Also, since he’s left-handed, I’m doing all my examples with my own left hand, for him to transpose my actions. In theory, this should make it easier for him to emulate my motion, but as I’m right-handed, it just means my writing comes out all wonky and strange, which is probably not desirable in a teacher.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/11/writing-a-letter-to-santa-is-not-easy-struggling-to-hold-a-pencil">Continue reading...</a>

Sir Keir Starmer should ignore those who say constitutional change is too difficult. Radical reinvigoration of our democracy must be a Labour priority<p>The cure for admiring the House of Lords is to describe it to someone from abroad. To an American, you will have to explain why there are more than 800 people entitled to sit in our grotesquely bloated upper chamber when the US manages with 100 senators. To anyone from anywhere, you will need to tell them about the presence of 92 hereditary peers, embedded on the red leather benches because some distant ancestor fought for a long-dead monarch or gave a bung to a long-gone prime minister. When one of these hereditaries shuffles off this mortal coil, there is then the most eccentric kind of ballot. The vacancy is filled at a byelection in which only hereditary peers can participate as candidates and voters. The rest are the “lifers”, a mix of the good, the bad and the ugly. Some are dedicated people of genuine distinction in fields such as science, public service or business. It would be a pity to lose their wisdom and experience, but a price worth paying to purge parliament of the many peers who are only there because successive party leaders have stuffed the place with cronies, toadies and donors. The ranks of the placemen and women have enlarged over recent years, swelling the mob of mediocrities and gargoyles who serve not the public interest, but only their own interests.</p><p>The contemporary “nobility” includes Baroness Mone, a creation of David Cameron.

<p>Unregulated ultrasound clinics run without proper training are making money out of maternal fears</p><p>One morning some years ago I was at a clinic in Brighton, having an appointment about an upcoming abortion. An odd winter, my second away from home, I was brittle and irritated with adult life. And I was confused when, suddenly, the woman turned the ultrasound screen round and told me to look at the heartbeat. The clinic’s window looked towards the sea, near a nightclub where I worked on the door, and I remember looking at her, then out of the window, then at the screen, where her finger hung by the black image for what felt like many minutes. I felt puzzled at the time, later shocked, today horrified.</p><p>I was reminded of that day twice recently: first when I heard about an anti-abortion charity in Scotland that gives ultrasound scans to women considering terminations, and then again when I read about a recent case in America. A teenager asking a judge for an abortion was told to have an ultrasound because (said the judge), “If the proposed mother is shown the ultrasound, they will change their mind.” By humanising the embryo they try to psychologically coerce the woman into going through with a pregnancy she knows she shouldn’t have.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/11/private-ultrasound-clinics-are-profiting-from-our-anxiety">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fishing gear used by Maine lobstermen is killing right whales. Will boosting a $1bn industry trump protecting an endangered species?</p><p>President Macron of France may not have realised it, but he walked into another fishing war earlier this month when he and 200 other guests were treated at the White House to butter-poached Maine lobster accented with American Osetra caviar and garnished with celery crisp.</p><p>At issue was the lobster, currently subject to a court ruling designed to prevent Maine’s lobstermen from trapping the crustacea in baited pots marked by lines that can fatally entangle feeding North Atlantic right whales. There are now just 340 such whales, with only about 100 breeding females, making the species one of the most endangered on the planet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/11/save-whales-or-eat-lobster-the-battle-reaches-the-white-house">Continue reading...</a>

Facing bullying and ostracisation at school (the education system clearly failed them, as would the health and legal services), they apparently retreated into their own private world before being dragged into the public spotlight in the 1980s after being arrested for acts of vandalism, theft and arson. Their story soon became the stuff of modern legend, inspiring dramas, documentaries and stage productions alike.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/11/the-silent-twins-review-intense-tale-of-inseparable-sisters">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>30 March 1950 – 14 October 2022</strong><br />His friend and fellow actor pays tribute to a stupendous talent with a rollicking, expansive, occasionally cruel spirit – and a vulnerable side he never let people see</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/dec/10/obituaries-2022-david-trimble-remembered-by-jonathan-powell">David Trimble remembered by Jonathan Powell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/the-observers-obituaries-of-2022">Read the Observer’s obituaries of 2022 in full</a></li></ul><p>It’s a long time since I was in touch with Robbie Coltrane. But I loved him so. He was a complicated man. With comedians, people always think that you look at them and you laugh, but there was so much more to Robbie than that. He had quite a sour, angry look at the world in many ways. I think that’s what gave him a depth in his acting that was quite stupendous. He was a major actor – I thought he was really gifted. One of the problems about <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/harrypotter">Harry Potter</a></em> is that it tends to obliterate all the other things that you do, because it’s such a powerful franchise. But Robbie was so much more than Hagrid.</p><p>Of course he was funny, but he made you laugh on both sides of your face, so to speak, because he saw the pain of life as well. And I think his last years were not happy. He retreated from the world a bit. I wasn’t in touch with him, but it wasn’t because we stopped being friends. You didn’t stop being friends with Robbie. He was a real presence in my life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/dec/11/obituaries-2022-robbie-coltrane-remembered-by-miriam-margolyes">Continue reading...</a>

Devise your own ceremony and include the two friends who knew you had this lover<p><em><strong>The dilemma </strong>I am a professional, single, middle-aged woman and I have been in a relationship with a married man for 12 years. He recently died suddenly. He and I loved each other. His feelings for me were separate and secondary to his commitment to his family. I was never misled by him on that front. I, therefore, walked into this relationship with my eyes wide open. Yet I knew from my previous experience of relationships that what we had was worth keeping in whatever form it could be kept. We were each other’s ideal partners, matched intellectually, sexually and emotionally, and immensely enjoyed each other’s company.</em></p><p><em>A small part of me wants to proclaim publicly that I was more than just a peripheral friend. I have two friends who did know, but had no friends in common with him who knew. Having lost my parents recently, I know another mode of grief – a grief that prompts empathy</em><em>, and the solace that empathy provides</em><em>. I feel abandoned and bereft in my secret loss, an inarticulate grief</em><em>. This is an intensely silent bereavement of one of the most significant relationships of my life.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/11/how-do-i-handle-the-death-of-my-secret-lover-">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nato head warns the war could spin out of control and Ukrainian president says eastern city of Bakhmut has been ‘destroyed’</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">See all our Ukraine war coverage</a></strong> </li></ul><p><strong>The fighting in Ukraine could spin out of control and become a war between Russia and Nato</strong>, the head of the alliance said in an interview with Norwegian broadcaster NRK. “If things go wrong, they can go horribly wrong,” Jens Stoltenberg said.</p><p><strong>Iran’s backing for the Russian military is likely to grow in coming months</strong> <strong>and Moscow will probably offer Tehran an “unprecedented” level of military support</strong> <strong>in return</strong>, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. The ministry’s latest intelligence update said Iran had become one of Russia’s top military backers since Russia invaded Ukraine in February and that Moscow was trying to obtain more weapons, including hundreds of ballistic missiles.</p><p><strong>Russian forces have “destroyed” the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said</strong>, while Ukraine’s military reported missile, rocket and airstrikes in multiple parts of the country. The latest battles of Russia’s nine and a half-month war in Ukraine have centred on four provinces that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, illegally claimed to have annexed in late September.</p><p><strong>Heavy fighting has continued in eastern and southern Ukraine</strong>, mainly in regions that Russia illegally annexed in September. Ukraine’s presidential office said on Friday that five civilians had been killed and another 13 wounded by Russian shelling in the past 24 hours.</p><p><strong>Boris Johnson has urged western countries to “look urgently” at what more they can do to support Ukraine</strong> in the hopes of ending the war against Russia as soon as next year. The former UK prime minister, who was hailed by Zelenskiy as a key ally, used an article in the Wall Street Journal to argue that ending the war as soon as possible is “in everyone’s interest, including Russia”.</p><p><strong>Russia wants to turn Ukraine into a “dependent dictatorship” like Belarus, the wife of jailed Belarusian Nobel peace prize laureate Ales Bialiatski said</strong> on Saturday upon receiving the prize on his behalf, speaking his words.

The health minister, Jean-Yves Duclos, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce head, Victor Dodig, were among those targeted.</p><p><strong>All non-critical infrastructure in Ukraine’s southern port city of Odesa were without power</strong> after Russia used drones to hit energy facilities, local officials said, with much of the surrounding region also affected.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/11/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-291-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
