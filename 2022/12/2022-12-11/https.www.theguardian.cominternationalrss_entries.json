Between 1991 and 2016 it had an age limit of 50, to encourage younger emerging artists. But if young artists once needed special encouragement, it is not at all clear they do now. In the visual arts, in playwriting, in literary fiction, in music, we seem to have nothing but young emerging artists. The most celebrated literary stars of the last decade have mostly been women in their late 20s and early 30s; the clutch of playwrights now dominating the London scene look like they could comfortably stage their own production of <em>Bugsy Malone</em>. The art magazine <em>Apollo</em> limits its annual lists of \u201cthe most inspiring artists, collectors and thinkers\u201d to those under 40, while prizes and grants available to visual artists fairly bristle with \u201cunder 35\u201d stipulations \u2013 as do those for writers.

He was a major actor \u2013 I thought he was really gifted.
