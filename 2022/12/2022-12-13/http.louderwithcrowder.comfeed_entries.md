Any word or thought the left disagrees with is called "violence." Like, as we learned from the Twitter files, the word "patriot." Yet no one on the left is ever held to account for their own "extremist" words. This is the first time I've seen a radical progressive call out on their bullsh*t. It needs to happen much more.</p><p>Rep. Nancy Mace, as we saw when she <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nancy-mace-texas-democrat-id" target="_blank">destroyed the argument against voter ID</a>, is VERY good at this. During a hearing on alleged  "white supremacy," she got all the witnesses to agree that rhetoric on Twitter can lead to violence. Then she hit one of the witnesses, Alejandra Caraballo, with her own extremism.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">At the <a href="https://twitter.com/OversightDems?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@OversightDems</a> hearing on white supremacy, Rep. <a href="https://twitter.com/NancyMace?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NancyMace</a> asked witnesses if extremist rhetoric on social media is a threat to democracy. Trans activist Alejandra Caraballo <a href="https://twitter.com/Esqueer_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Esqueer_</a> said, "Yes." The congresswoman then presented Caraballo's tweets. <a href="https://t.co/z5VG89Kf0w">https://t.co/z5VG89Kf0w</a> <a href="https://t.co/OnAEsAOIgb">pic.twitter.com/OnAEsAOIgb</a><br />‚Äî Andy Ng√¥ üè≥Ô∏èüåà (@MrAndyNgo) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1602723204207886342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Shortly after radical leftists <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ruth-sent-us-brett-kavanaugh" target="_blank">published the addresses of the right-leaning Supreme Court justices</a> and one showed up to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brett-kavanaugh-wife-daughters" target="_blank">assassinate Brett Kavanaugh</a>, this progressive activist called for public officials to be further ACCOSTED in public. She attempted to delegitimize a government institution. Two things that she just admitted were a threat to democracy. Yet when she said it and was (proverbial) smacked across the head with her own words... she claims she didn't mean it like that.</p><p>I would point out that Caraballo's tweet came two week before the White House announced <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/white-house-supports-harassing-scotus" target="_blank">its support for accosting Supreme Court Justices at their homes</a> for doing democratic duty.</p><p>Now if you'll excuse me, the clip of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/byron-donalds-rescue-plan" target="_blank">Rep. Donalds</a> calling out Caraballo's extremist rhetoric against concerned parents gets cut off. I'm sure that one will be fun to watch as well.</p><p><p>

## Disgraced CNN producer pleads guilty to despicable child sex crime

Then he tried luring a nine-year-old girl to his Vermont ski house. Now he is facing 10-to-life after pleading guilty to the crime.</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cnn-producer-lawsuit" target="_blank">Back in December</a>, Griffin was charged in criminal court for using chat apps to contact parents with young daughters, ‚Äútelling them that a woman is a woman regardless of her age,‚Äô and because ‚Äòwomen should be sexually subservient and inferior to men,‚Äô they should send their daughters to him so he could properly train them.‚Äù</p><blockquote><em>These activities occurred from April to July 2020. In June 2020, Griffin managed to convince one mother of 9- and 13-year-old girls that the daughters should be brought to him for the aforementioned purpose. He sent the mother $3000 for plane tickets, and when they arrived in Boston, he sexually abused the girl.</em></blockquote><p>To add to the disgust you are no doubt feeling right now, in January it was discovered there was a warrant out for Griffin's arrest... that the FBI ignored for seventeen months. It would appear the feds were too busy having tea with Twitter executives to do a basic part of their job, like arrest a guy charged with attempting to sex up a kid. </p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/fbi-cnn-whistleblower" target="_blank">From the FBI whistleblower</a>:</p><blockquote><em>[The feds] don‚Äôt give a damn about these kind of cases. [‚Ä¶] He obviously is a sexual predator, and has gone from grooming children into actually capturing them. [‚Ä¶] [He‚Äôs a] very, very dangerous offender.</em></blockquote><p>On Monday. <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/ex-cnn-producer-pleads-guilty-to-child-sex-charge-in-deal/ar-AA15cgvE" target="_blank">Griffin entered a plea deal</a> where he plead guilty to the interstate commerce (of a nine-year-old) crime. The courts dropped the other two charges.</p><p>He'll be sentenced in March of 2023, where he can get anywhere between ten years in prison to life. If he makes it out of jail in one piece, he will have to register as a sex offender not have any contact with anyone under the age of eighteen.</p><p>Griffin was one of two pedos CNN employees that were uncovered last December. Producer Rick Saleeby was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cnn-producer-runs-away" target="_blank">part of a Project Veritas sting</a>, where he openly discussed wanting to have sex with his fianc√©'s 14-year-old daughter.</p><p><p>

## Elon Musk tweets bunny emoji, sends woke scientist down rabbit hole of conspiracies

So much so, the Chief Twit doing nothing but tweeting an emoji will send alleged PhDs into a web of conspiracy theories.</p><p>Yesterday, Elon tweeted the word "follow" with an emoji of a bunny rabbit.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Follow üê∞<br />‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1602472202619654144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought he was being cute about going down the rabbit hole. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-twitter-files" target="_blank">Every day</a> brings us <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-files-two" target="_blank">a new Twitter file</a> exposing more of what <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-execs-censorship" target="_blank">activist employees</a> were <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-censorship-employee-concern" target="_blank">doing behind the scenes</a>. We are following clues down the rabbit hole. It made sense. To me.</p><p>Not to Caroline Orr Bueno, PhD. She is a behavioral scientist who studies disinformation according to her Twitter bio. What you and I saw as an emoji, she saw as a signal to you-know-who. The group that comes after "P" and before "R."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Elon Musk is now explicitly encouraging his 120 million followers to start following QAnon.<br /><br />Put differently, Elon Musk is encouraging his 120 million followers to join a domestic terrorism movement. <a href="https://t.co/W7O9nLuivh">pic.twitter.com/W7O9nLuivh</a><br />‚Äî Caroline Orr Bueno, Ph.D (@RVAwonk) <a href="https://twitter.com/RVAwonk/status/1602490533586378755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Dr. Bueno Ph.D. then, in a follow-up tweet, shared screen captures of people who follow that specific conspiracy. Unlike the liberal media, I will NOT amplify their lunacy here. But Dr. Bueno Ph.D. took comments made by crazy people who claim to see the hidden meaning in everything, chose a few where they "saw hidden meaning" in Musk's tweet, and then used their ramblings to prove her belief Elon was signaling to them.</p><p>Did I mention how Dr. Bueno Ph.D. claims to study "disinformation?"</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="cf927" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32333540&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>None of this is amusing to Dr. Bueno Ph.D. Though it's very amusing to Elon Musk.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Lmaooo<br />‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1602539886124449794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The question remaining is what's the over/under for when Elon tweets a 'pizza emoji" and a "group of kids" emoji just to be silly? I'm setting it for Thursday.</p><p><p>

	Joe Biden is hosting a bill signing ceremony today for the passage of the "Respect for Marriage Act," which federalizes same-sex marriage. To celebrate, the White House has invited drag queens to be there while Biden signs his name to a piece of paper. As of this writing, it is unclear what men dressed as women have to do with respecting marriage. But one special guest, Marti Cummings, has caught the attention of the internet.
</p><p>
	Citizen journalist Libs of TikTok has obtained many of Cummings's now private and/or deleted tweets. In recent years, "family-friendly" drag shows have taken America by storm. This is where parents take their little kids to see performances that were once meant for adults. Cummings is a regular at these "family-friendly" drag shows that some critics believe aren't family-friendly at all. Or even appropriate.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
		Biden invited a drag queen to the White House today for the signing of the Respect for Marriage Act. This drag queen performs and puts on shows for kids. The Biden admin encourages this. <a href="https://t.co/s8dCDBZJBA">pic.twitter.com/s8dCDBZJBA</a><br />

</blockquote></div><p>Question. At what point did the left decide drag queens were the literal only way to prove how tolerant you are? Because <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-maher-kid-rock" target="_blank">while there is bipartisan agreement that kids should be left alone</a>, it feels like the more conservatives say something is inappropriate, the more the radical left in control of the Democrat Party makes it a part of their very being.</p><p>There have always been drag shows. Adult men would dress up like women, give themselves a double entendre for a name, tell some raunchy jokes and entertain ADULTS in bars. If that's your thing, fine.</p><p>Then minors would <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mashable-ten-year-old-drag-queen" target="_self">dress up like women and entertain adults in bars</a>. Conservatives said, "hey, this seems inappropriate."</p><p>The left doubled down with "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mashable-ten-year-old-drag-queen" target="_self">Drag Queen Story Time</a>." Conservatives said, "guys, let's leave children alone because this is wrong."</p><p>Now if you DON'T support all drag queens all the time, you hate every single one of the Ls, Gs, Bs, especially the Ts, Qs, As, Is, other Is, Ps, and whatever the hell the +s are.</p><p>The message being sent by the White House is that they agree. Unclear is if Cummings will be performing for President Biden during his visit today. </p><p><p>

## Disturbing video shows Chicago students bullying boy with down syndrome, forcing him to hide in a bathroom stall

The school superintendent said the school was, quote, "deeply disappointed and saddened by the actions of this small group of students." Well, that's good. I would have gone with "disgusted." But being "disappointed" is okay too.</p><p>We're also told there will be consequences, and those responsible will be brought to justice.</p><p>The kids were heard yelling "World Star," a reference to "world star videos" where fights go viral on the internet. That means these students thought this video would make them social media famous. It might have even been their goal. </p><p>As for the consequences, and I'm just spitballing here, but the d*ckhead filming the incident should have his phone taken from him and shoved up his legal guardian's hindparts. Lube the phone up first, because otherwise the punishment might be considered cruel and unusual. That way the kid is taught a lesson, the legal guardian is taught a lesson about raising such a monster, and it hopefully teaches others a lesson to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bullies-girl-portland-bystanders" target="_blank">put their damn phone down</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/las-vegas-student-beaten-unconscious" target="_blank">help people</a>.</p><p>As for the other students involved, suspension and community service would be nice. Or, if we want the time to better fit the crime, these kids wanted social media notoriety. No doubt their peers can identify who is in the video via photos on their Instagram or whatever else the kids are using these days. Those same peers have access to photoshop, social media, and vengeance. An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth. And a social media bullying for a social media bullying.</p><p><p>

It looks at the two days when a "debate" was had amongst tweeps over permanently banning the President of the United States. The tl;dr of it all (<a href="https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1602364197194432515" target="_blank">even though you should</a>) is that a bunch of emotional hemophiliac Twitter employees who had wanted to ban Trump for years since -- he is literal Hitler literally -- shot their shot, and the brass at the bird app bent the knee. One lone employee from China said, "You know, I've seen this movie before... do not recommend."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>We already know <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-engineer-free-speech" target="_blank">Twitter's "commie as f*ck" employees don't believe in free speech</a>. However, one employee who is from communist China attempted to dissent during the company-wide Donald Trump is Over Party.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">7. There were dissenters inside Twitter. <br /><br />‚ÄúMaybe because I am from China,‚Äù said one employee on January 7, ‚ÄúI deeply understand how censorship can destroy the public conversation.‚Äù <a href="https://t.co/LtonK0gfS3">pic.twitter.com/LtonK0gfS3</a><br />‚Äî Bari Weiss (@bariweiss) <a href="https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1602365655595962368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>Maybe because I am from China, I deeply understand how censorship can destroy public conversation.</blockquote><p>For an example of what the employee is talking about, please see: <em><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/china-protests-foreign-forces" target="_blank">Right the F*ck Now</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/china-protests" target="_blank">The Protests Happening in China</a></em>. Also, any <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/critical-race-theory-mom-chinese" target="_blank">person who has seen the left's preferred policies in IRL</a>. </p><p>While the commie-as-f*ck Twitter employees appreciated the input of the employee who has experienced it before, meh.</p><blockquote>I understand this fear, but I also think it‚Äôs important to understand that censorship by a government is very different than censorship of the government.</blockquote><p>The difference is when the government is being censored by an institution that has grown to be more powerful than most governments, it's worse.</p><blockquote>The first amendment in the U.S. exist specifically to prevent the government from silencing the people </blockquote><p>So, instead, the government works <em>with</em> a private company to silence the people on their behalf. That way, it's not "the government" silencing the people. It's a private company...filled with activist employees who agree with the government's political agenda. This started with the feds "asking" Twitter to censor a news story. It turned into the Biden Administration working with Twitter (and Facebook) directly.</p><p>The fact that a lone person from Communist China was the dissenter over a bunch of woke Americans is a little too on the nose.</p><p><p>
