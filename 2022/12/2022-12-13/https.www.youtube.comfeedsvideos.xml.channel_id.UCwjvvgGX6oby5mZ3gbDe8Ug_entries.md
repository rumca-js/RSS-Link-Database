Recently, the Chinese Communist Party CCP made a sharp U-turn in its official epidemic prevention policy. It has not only issued a series of new regulations to loosen epidemic prevention, but also no longer mentioned its insistence on the "dynamic zero-Covid policy." Most Chinese welcome China to actually end the Zero-Covid policy. The international community sees it as good news in general too. But this change comes so suddenly without adequate official preparation and transition. Different local governments end up interpreting the central government's policy differently, creating a chaotic situation when viewed from various aspects at a national level.
