<p>In one of his first all-hands meetings after taking over the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html"><ins>company in October</ins></a>, Elon Musk told Twitter employees the website’s financial position was dire, warning <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-bankruptcy-215850492.html"><ins>bankruptcy was “not out of question.”</ins></a> Since then, it appears the situation at Twitter has become more fraught.</p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8xMy90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2Vsb24tbXVzay10d2l0dGVyLXNoYWtldXAuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNmJkYjUyNjgtYzMxNy00NDU4LWIwMTAtMGFiMDg4ODlmMGM5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAdaasSHADyPPZCeYj2JkjsxrDMfIMtbKEf6U8lRw7ag1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2022%2F12%2F13%2Ftechnology%2Felon-musk-twitter-shakeup.html"><em><ins>The New York Times</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>reports<em>&nbsp;</em>the company is taking drastic steps to cut costs. In recent “weeks,” Twitter has reportedly not paid rent for its main headquarters in San Francisco and satellite offices in other countries. According to court documents obtained by <em>The Times</em>, the company has also refused to pay a $197,725 bill for charter flights Musk took during his first week at Twitter. Simultaneously, the social media website has continued to cut staff – despite Musk having recently told employees the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-done-with-job-cuts-blue-verified-062148989.html"><ins>was done with layoffs</ins></a>. Among the most recent casualties include Nelson Abramson, the company’s global head of infrastructure. On Monday, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-dissolves-its-trust-and-safety-council-064143124.html"><ins>disbanded its Trust and Safety Council</ins></a> of external advisors.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to <em>The Times</em>, Musk and other executives have also talked about the potential consequences of denying severance payments to the thousands of people who were let go from the company in recent weeks. When he first took ownership of Twitter, Musk reportedly considered dismissing many of the employees who were subsequently laid off without any severance. However, he eventually decided to give US employees at least one month of severance pay, a move that ensured the company was in compliance with state and federal labor laws.</p><p>Amid those cost-cutting efforts, Musk has reshaped Twitter’s legal team in anticipation of the legal battles the company is likely to face in the near future. He recently dismissed Alex Spiro. The criminal defense lawyer was one of Musk’s close personal allies. In 2019, he successfully defended the billionaire in his infamous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-06-elon-musk-mini-sub-pedo-guy.html"><ins>“pedo guy” defamation case.</ins></a> Musk had charged Spiro with leading the company’s legal and policy teams but reportedly became displeased with his personal lawyer after finding out he had kept James Baker on as Twitter’s deputy general counsel. Musk fired Baker after finding out the former FBI attorney had been responsible for reviewing the company’s decision to restrict posts related to a 2020 article <em>The New York Post</em> published about Hunter Biden’s laptop.</p><p>Since then, Musk has reportedly brought over “more than half a dozen” lawyers from SpaceX to fill the void left by Spiro and Baker. Among those who are now advising Twitter include SpaceX's Senior Vice President and General Counsel Tim Hughes. Anticipating potential litigation, Musk has also told employees not to pay travel invoices and other vendors the company owes money to for their services.</p>

## Audio from a Martian dust devil captured for the first time

<p>NASA announced today that the Perseverance rover has <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/status/425/experiencing-a-dust-devil/">captured audio</a> from a Martian dust devil for the first time. But the clip not only treats us to the novelty of hearing an extraterrestrial vortex; it could also help scientists better understand how dust might affect future Mars missions.</p><p>The rover's microphones picked up the dust devil on September 27th, 2021. To the casual ear, it sounds similar to a microphone picking up a wind gust on Earth, but scientists can learn much more. “As the dust devil passed over Perseverance we could actually hear individual impacts of grains on the rover,” Naomi Murdoch, planetary scientist and the author of new report, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2022/12/13/mars-rover-dust-devil/">told</a><em>The Washington Post</em>. “We could actually count them.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Dust is a significant factor in planning for Mars missions. It can erode a spacecraft’s heat shields, damage scientific instruments, incapacitate parachutes and smother solar panels.</p><p>Scientists estimate the recorded whirlwind measured about 82 feet wide by 387 feet high. (Although that may sound intimidating, this relatively minor storm didn’t damage the rover.) As you can hear below (via <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-captured-sound-dust-devil-mars"><em>Science News</em></a>), the clip includes a brief pause in the turbulence as the dust devil’s eye passes over the rover.</p><div id="4d18cae5d32c4e74a7938ddca1016801"></div><p>Perseverance also captured images (also included in the recording) of the approaching storm. Scientists had to coordinate their instruments to boost the odds of recording a storm. The rover only records sound snippets lasting under three minutes and only does so eight times per month. That meant timing them for when dust devils are most likely to hit while pointing its cameras where they’re most likely to approach. In this case, that preparation — and no small degree of luck — paid off.</p><p>“I can’t think of a previous case where so much data from so many instruments contributed to characterizing a single dust devil,” said John Edward Moores, a planetary scientist at York University. “Had the [camera] been pointing in a different direction or the microphone observation been scheduled just a few seconds later, key pieces of the story would be missing. Sometimes it helps to be lucky in science!”</p><p>The roughly 10-ft.-long Perseverance rover <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nas-as-mars-2020-rover-and-helicopter-are-nearly-ready-to-launch-162518162.html">launched</a> on July 30th, 2020 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/perseverance-lands-on-mars-205800998.html">touched Martian soil</a> on February 18th, 2021. NASA uses the vehicle to explore the Jezero crater and search for signs of ancient microbial life as part of the <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/">Mars 2020 mission</a>.</p>

## Honda's 2023 Accord Touring will be its first car with Google apps built-in

<p>Honda is joining the ranks of automakers embracing Google's services. As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-android-automotive-os-honda-2022-160039999.html">teased last year</a>, the company has <a href="https://hondanews.com/en-US/honda-automobiles/releases/all-new-accord-adds-google-built-in-to-its-must-have-technologies">announced</a> that the 2023 Accord sedan's high-end Touring trim will be the brand's first car with Google built-in as standard. You'll have out-of-the-dealership access to Google Assistant, Google Maps and the Play Store on the vehicle's 12.3-inch infotainment display. You can tweak the climate control, navigate or download a favorite music app without relying on your phone.</p><p>There's no mention of pricing for the Google features. GM offers three free years of Google built-in access for vehicles like the GMC Yukon, but requires a $15 monthly subscription after that. You won't lose all functionality after that, though. The Accord Touring will also support Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, with a 15W wireless charger to keep your phone running.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Honda hasn't said which other cars will adopt the functionality. It won't be surprising if the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/honda-prologue-ev-design-reveal-160536773.html">Prologue EV</a> and other future models use the technology, however. A handful of rivals already use some form of Google built-in, including Volvo, its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-polestar-2-is-a-sporty-ev-fastback-with-allnew-android-automotive-140040133.html">Polestar</a> offshoot, GM's brands and Renault. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-and-lincoln-vehicles-will-run-on-android-starting-in-2023-163021225.html">Ford will also use the platform</a> starting in 2023.</p><p>Google has strong incentives to bring its apps to as many cars as possible — to an extent, it's racing against time. Amazon Alexa is already available in some cars, and manufacturers are gaining more control over it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alexa-custom-assistant-for-cars-130006593.html">thanks to Custom Assistant</a>. Apple doesn't (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-car-no-longer-fully-self-driving-193708593.html">currently</a>) have a standalone platform for cars, but its new generation of CarPlay can effectively <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-next-car-play-will-meld-itself-to-your-car-infotainment-system-174750787.html">take over your dash</a>. If Google doesn't win enough partners, it risks losing influence in the automotive world.</p><p>Not everyone is happy about expansions like these. Senator Elizabeth Warren has called on the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elizabeth-warren-ftc-doj-letter-big-tech-automotive-210050289.html">investigate Big Tech's expansion to cars</a>. She's concerned Google and others might stifle competition by requiring service bundles and otherwise discouraging the use of third-party apps. Honda won't be affected by this political pressure in the near term, but it may get more control over app selection if regulators decide to act.</p><p></p>

## Congress introduces bill to ban TikTok over spying fears

<p>American politicians aren't just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/south-dakota-bans-tiktok-from-government-owned-devices-093526831.html">restricting access to TikTok</a> — they now hope to ban it outright. Members of the <a href="https://gallagher.house.gov/media/press-releases/gallagher-rubio-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-ban-tiktok">House</a> and <a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=Press-Releases&amp;id=D1C2E147-3A23-4F49-AC27-268572AABDCD">Senate</a> have introduced matching bills that would block transactions from any social media company in or influenced by China, Russia, Cuba, Iran, North Korea or Venezuela. The ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act (Averting the National Threat of Internet Surveillance, Oppressive Censorship and Influence, and Algorithmic Learning by the Chinese Communist Party) is meant to shut down access to TikTok and other apps that could theoretically funnel American user data to oppressive governments, censor news or otherwise manipulate the public.</p><p>The rationale echoes what US political leaders have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-wechat-executive-order-014615752.html">argued for years</a>. While TikTok has taken efforts to distance its international operations from those in China, such as by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-user-data-us-200500287.html">storing US data domestically</a>, critics have argued that parent company ByteDance is ultimately at the mercy of the Chinese government. TikTok could potentially profile government workers and otherwise surveil Americans, according to the often-repeated claims.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Republican bill co-sponsors Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mike Gallagher tried to draw links between some ByteDance leadership and the Chinese Communist Party in an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/10/marco-rubio-ban-tiktok-america-china-mike-gallagher/">opinion piece</a> in <em>The Washington Post</em> this November. At the time, 23 directors had previously worked for state-backed media, and &quot;at least&quot; 15 employees still did. The bill is also sponsored by House Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi.</p><p>In a statement, a TikTok spokesperson said it was &quot;troubling&quot; that members of Congress were putting forward legislation to ban the app rather than waiting for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-revokes-trump-tiktok-wechat-orders-144643108.html">national security review</a> to wind down. The bills will &quot;do nothing to advance&quot; national security, according to the company. The firm added that it would &quot;continue to brief&quot; Congress on plans developed under the watch of security officials. The social network has consistently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-denies-allegations-forbes-061004399.html">denied plans to track American users</a> or otherwise deliberately assist Chinese surveillance efforts in the country.</p><p>TikTok already faces some legal action. The states of Maryland and South Dakota have banned TikTok on government devices over security concerns. Indiana, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/indiana-tiktok-lawsuit-214110286.html">sued TikTok</a> for allegedly deceiving users about China's data access and child safety violations. That lawsuit would fine TikTok and demand changes to the service's info handling and marketing claims.</p><p>Whether or not the bills become legislation isn't certain. President Biden <a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-revokes-trump-tiktok-wechat-orders-144643108.html">revoked former President Trump's orders</a> to ban TikTok downloads, and instead required a fresh national security review. He's not expected to override his own order. And while the bill sponsors characterize the measure as bipartisan, it's not clear the call for a TikTok ban has enough support to clinch the necessary votes and reach Biden's desk. To some degree, the ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act is more a signal of intent than a practical attempt to block TikTok.</p>

## IMDb now lets performers remove their age and personal details

<p>IMDb announced today that entertainment professionals can now choose whether to display their age and other demographic information on their profiles. Screen performers’ union SAG-AFTRA had pushed for the change for years, viewing it as a front in the war on ageism in Hollywood.</p><p>The new policy lets anyone with an IMDb page claim their profile and choose whether their age and birth year, birth name, alternate names and other demographic information show on their profiles. Although performers’ ages will remain on places like Wikipedia, the actors’ union SAG-AFTRA believes the policy will discourage age-based discrimination.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a letter to union members (reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2022/biz/news/imdb-policy-update-member-age-names-1235459497/"><em>Variety</em></a>), SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said she worked closely with IMDb for several months to influence the policy shift. “This means professionals can choose how they want to represent themselves to fans and industry decision-makers,” she wrote. “And it will make it easier for casting directors, producers and others to discover and hire talent from all backgrounds for their project.” In addition, Drescher noted that the new policy covers free and paid IMDb accounts.</p><p>IMDb, which Amazon owns, spent years resisting the change. In 2016, California <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-26-actors-are-now-virtually-immortal-in-california.html">passed a law</a> barring websites from publishing the ages and birthdates of performers. It was a popular law with performers, as over 2,300 people asked IMDb to remove their ages in the three months following the bill’s passage. However, IMDb <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-07-imdb-california-age-law.html">refused to oblige</a>, filed an injunction based on First Amendment rights and won. (SAG-AFTRA and the state of California appealed, but an appeals court upheld the initial ruling.) Apart from Drescher’s note about working with IMDb, it’s unclear what factors led to Amazon's about-face.</p><p>Although ageism isn't limited to any single industry, Hollywood is a textbook example — especially towards women. Dame Helen Mirren hasn’t minced words on the subject, describing the practice as “fucking outrageous” in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/17/helen-mirren-ageism-hollywood-women">2015 interview</a>. “We all watched James Bond as he got more and more geriatric, and his girlfriends got younger and younger. It’s so annoying.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/boom/">Boom</a> has revealed more details about Symphony, the engine for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/overture/">Overture</a> jet with which it aims to bring back commercial supersonic air travel after the retirement of Concorde. Most importantly, the company has secured a new partner to develop the engine after it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boom-engine-manufacturer-supersonic-airplane-093618078.html">parted ways with Rolls-Royce</a> in September.&nbsp;</p><p>FTT, a division of Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, will help design Symphony. Some of FTT's engineers were behind the F-22 and F-35 fighter jet engines, so they have experience in powering supersonic aircraft.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Symphony is a medium-bypass turbofan engine that will have the same basic architecture as current commercial aircraft engines. However, Boom says <a href="https://boomsupersonic.com/flyby/post/introducing-symphony-the-sustainable-and-cost-efficient-engine-for-overture">its new propulsion system</a> is designed to help Symphony achieve 35,000 pounds of thrust and speeds of Mach 1.7. Boom claims that Overture will be able to fly between Newark and London in under four hours and San Francisco to Tokyo in around six hours.</p><div id="ae96d098430940cea880046012726689"></div><p>Boom expects Symphony to deliver a 25 percent increase in time on wing (i.e. in-flight time) and claims it will have significantly lower maintenance costs than other engines. The engine will be the first that's optimized for fully sustainable aviation fuel, Boom says, and it will operate at net zero carbon. Symphony will also have a single-stage fan that's designed for quiet operation.</p><p>Despite the switch in engine partners, Boom says the jet is still on track for certification in 2029. Production is set to start in 2024 at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boom-supersonic-jet-factory-north-carolina-announcement-192553128.html">a factory in North Carolina</a> with the first jet scheduled to leave the factory in 2026. Boom now expects test flights to start in 2027, a year later than previously planned.&nbsp;</p><p>The company already has customers lined up. American Airlines <a href="https://www.engadget.com/american-airlines-boom-overture-jet-purchase-191453014.html">placed an order</a> earlier this year for 20 jets, with an option for another 40.

<p>Apple is reportedly preparing to open iOS to competing app stores. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-13/will-apple-allow-users-to-install-third-party-app-stores-sideload-in-europe?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg's </em>Mark Gurman</a>, the company's software and services teams are redesigning the platform to &quot;open up key elements.&quot; That effort is likely to end in Apple giving iPhone and iPad users the option to download third-party apps without going through the App Store. In turn, that would allow developers to avoid the company's infamous 30 and 15 percent commissions on payments. Gurman reports the forthcoming charges are primarily designed to placate European Union lawmakers, who recently passed the bloc's sweeping <a href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-digital-markets-services-acts-131818075.html">Digital Markets and Services Act</a>, and will be initially implemented on the continent before potentially rolling out to other regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Apple did not immediately respond to Engadget's comment request.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to Gurman, Apple plans to have the changes ready to release alongside iOS 17 next year. Companies have until 2024 to be in full compliance with the Digital Markets Act. The legislation is particularly problematic for Apple, as it outlaws many of the speedbumps the company has relied on to make it difficult for consumers to leave iOS. For instance, the act calls for interoperability between different messaging platforms and equal access for outside developers to core operating system features. Critically, it also mandates that platform holders allow for sideloading.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple has consistently lobbied against the practice, calling it a security and privacy risk. Gurman reports the company is considering whether it should enforce certain security requirements on software distributed outside the App Store. &quot;Such apps also may need to be verified by Apple — a process that could carry a free,&quot; he suggests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are other major changes that could come to iOS as a direct result of the Digital Markets Act. Apple could open up major APIs and features, including those that control the iPhone's NFC and camera technologies, to outside developers. Historically, only the company's Wallet app and Apple Pay service have had access to the iPhone's NFC chip. What's more, the company is considering whether to drop its longstanding requirement that third-party browsers must use its WebKit framework. Apple may also further open up its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-find-my-third-party-173257478.html">Find My Network to competitors like Tile</a>.</p><p>At the same time, it appears there are some golden eggs the tech giant may be much more reluctant to give away. Specifically, Gurman reports RCS integration within iMessage is currently not on the table. Google has pushed the messaging protocol for years, going so far as to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/drake-texts-go-green-apple-google-rcs-161802322.html">criticize Apple publically for not adopting it</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Developing...</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/netflix/"><ins>Netflix</ins></a> has added two more titles to its (very good) stable of mobile games: <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em> and <em>Twelve Minutes</em>. They're the first Annapurna Interactive titles to join the lineup. They're available now for all subscribers, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-basic-with-ads-explainer-190555318.html"><ins>including those on the ad-supported plan</ins></a><ins>,</ins> on iOS and Android.</p><p>It's been a while since Netflix first said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oxenfree-free-to-download-netflix-subscribers-192319194.html"><ins>bring </ins><em><ins>Kentucky Route Zero</ins></em><ins> to its library</ins></a> and it's a welcome addition. It's a narrative-driven point-and-click adventure game that took the developers at Cardboard Computer almost a decade to see through. The first chapter debuted in 2013 and the fifth and final one arrived in 2020. It was a long journey, but the BAFTA award winner <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-27-kentucky-route-zero-act-v-review-tv-edition-interview.html"><ins>garnered strong reviews along the way</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d859564b17314121bda34c8cf0e8ab8a"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p><em>Twelve Minutes</em>, on the other hand, wasn't received quite as warmly.

<p>Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment today <a href="https://www.hogwartslegacy.com/en-us/faq">delayed</a><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> yet again, but the most demanding versions of the game are spared. Instead, the postponement pushes the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions back to April 4th, 2023, with the Nintendo Switch variant arriving on July 25th.</p><p>Previously, the last-gen versions were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hogwarts-legacy-release-date-delay-185247236.html">scheduled to launch</a> on February 10th alongside the PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC iterations.

This latest reshuffling should give developer Avalanche Software time to polish the Harry Potter-themed game for older systems.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Warner Bros. initially slated the wizarding title for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/howarts-legacy-2021-202710492.html">2021 launch</a> but later <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hogwarts-legacy-harry-potter-game-delay-2022-warner-bros-174436556.html">pushed it back</a> to this year and, finally, to 2023. Starting on February 7th, people who buy the Deluxe Edition for PS5, Xbox Series X/S or PC will have 72 hours of early access to start their adventure. However, the delayed versions won’t have an early-access period.</p><figure><img alt="A student practicing magic in a gameplay still from 'Hogwarts Legacy'" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/0ba03240-7b0e-11ed-bfdb-0130976ae693" style="height: 844; width: 1500;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Avalanche Software/Warner Bros.

## iPadOS 16.2 includes Freeform collaboration app and Stage Manager on an external display

<p>iPadOS 16 launched a little later this year than its predecessors, and a few key features weren’t quite ready. With iPadOS 16.2, which just arrived this afternoon, I think Apple has caught up with what it planned. There are two major new features on board here. First, Stage Manager multitasking now works across an external display, provided you’re using an iPad with an M1 or M2 chip inside. Second, the collaborative brainstorming and productivity app Freeform is now available on the iPad (and on the iPhone and Mac, as well).&nbsp;</p><p>Freeform is one of the more flexible and customizable apps Apple has made in a long time. For me, the first thing it reminded me of is a more ambitious version of Apple’s own Notes app. Over the years, Notes has become capable at handling a lot more than text — you can scan documents, add images, draw with the Apple Pencil on the iPad and more. The same can be said about Freeform, though it’s much less of a text-first app.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When you start a new document, you’re met with a ever-expanding blank canvas. At the top of the screen are just a few interface elements, most significantly the five items that let you add content to your board. Those main categories are Apple Pencil; sticky notes; a library of about 700 shapes and icons; text boxes; and a general-purpose “import” button that lets you pull in things from the Files app, your photo library or URLs you can paste in.</p><p>These features all seem pretty straightforward, but there’s a lot of underlying complexity to them. A text box opens with simple black text on the white background, but you can adjust size, fonts, colors, format and drop in three different types of lists. The shapes you can add are numerous and varied; most of them are flat, 2D representations of things like geometric shapes, animals, people, food, and so forth. But you can break apart a shape into its component pieces and move them around individually, resize them, change the colors or just use the one part of it that you really want. And any time you interact with an element in Freeform, guide lines will appear to help you line it up with the content around it. You can also group individual elements (like a text box and a photo) so that they respond as a single object.</p><figure><img alt="iPadOS 16.2 Freeform shapes" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/b62366e0-7b10-11ed-befe-625b17875ffb" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Freeform is also pretty great at accepting different files and attachments. Links to things like articles on a web site or a YouTube video show up with the page title and a preview (unfortunately, YouTube videos don’t play right in Freeform itself). Some things, like photos and audio files, do work right in Freeform though — you can tap a photo to see it full screen or an audio file to hear what’s in it.</p><p>While Freeform works fine when using it on your own, Apple has clearly pitched it as a collaborative tool. I haven’t been able to try that yet, but now that the software is out of beta I should get a chance soon. But like the other collaboration features Apple included in iPadOS 16 this year, it’s easy to bring other people into a Freeform board. There’s a share button in the top right corner of the app, and you can invite people via email, the Messages app or just by sharing a link.&nbsp;</p><p>When adding people via Messages, everyone in the thread is automatically added to the board as an editor (though you can change that if you want it to be read-only). Then, as people add their own content to the board, you can see what has changed via an activity feed. And for real-time collaboration, you can kick off a FaceTime call with everyone working on the document.</p><p>The updates to Stage Manager are more straightforward, mostly because we’ve had a chance to test them already. If you’re using an iPad with an M1 or M2 chip, you can connect an external display and extend your iPad’s screen, rather than just mirror it. This means you can have different groups of apps running on both the iPad’s built-in screen as well as the external monitor, just as you can on a Mac (or most other computers).&nbsp;</p><p>When you connect to a monitor, the external display is blank by default. But  if you move your cursor on to that screen and launch an app from the Dock, it’ll pop up there. You can also click any open apps on the iPad screen and send it to the other display via the three dot menu at the top of the screen.&nbsp;</p><p>Just as on the iPad display, the layout of apps on your external display isn’t fully customizable. Instead, there are a wide variety of sizes you can set them to, and as you add more apps to a space they dynamically rearrange themselves. You have some flexibility to move things where you want, but pixel-perfect manipulation like you’re used to on a Mac isn’t possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite these caveats, there’s no doubt that using an iPad with an external display is a lot more useful than it was before. Previously, you could only mirror your iPad’s display — being able to extend your iPad to a much larger screen is another big step towards making the tablet better suited for “real work.”&nbsp;</p><p>As for Freeform, its usefulness will probably depend on how many Apple users there are in your orbit. If your workplace depends heavily on devices like Macs or iPads, it could gain some traction. But breaking a new tool into a workflow that’s already been established can be difficult, so how popular Freeform will get remains a big question mark. Of course, it’s not restricted to workplace use — maybe families where two partners are already using iPads will enjoy organizing vacations or other, more mundane life events with Freeform.&nbsp;</p>

## Apple releases iOS 16.2 with always-on display changes and tighter security

<p>Apple is finishing 2022 by releasing major software updates for its devices. The upgrades are headlined by iOS 16.2, which should be particularly useful for the security-conscious. The new version adds an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-advanced-data-protection-imessage-contact-key-183819737.html">Advanced Data Protection</a> option that brings end-to-end encryption to more of your iCloud data, including device backups, Messages content, notes and photos. And like it or not, Apple is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-china-airdrop-limit-everyone-ios-16-2-223231192.html">limiting AirDrop sharing</a> — you'll now have 10 minutes to swap files with &quot;everyone&quot; before the feature reverts to contacts-only. The restriction first arrived in China, allegedly in a bid to appease officials trying to stymie protests, but may be useful if you're worried someone might <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-30-nyc-lawmakers-criminalize-unwanted-dick-pics.html">push unwanted content</a> to your device.</p><p>This is also a particularly important update if you're an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-14-pro-max-review-dynamic-island-useful-always-on-display-battery-life-camera-test-sample-pictures-130020449.html">iPhone 14 Pro</a> or Pro Max owner. You can now hide your wallpaper and notifications when the 14 Pro's always-on display kicks in. Yes, that makes it behave more like some Android phones, but it could also reduce distractions (some say it still looks like the phone is awake with the wallpaper on) and bolster privacy. Live Activities are now available for MLB, NBA and Premier League games on all iPhones courtesy of the TV app, although you'll need one of the 14 Pro models to see them on your home screen through the Dynamic Island.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other improvements largely focus on new apps and expected revisions. The long-promised <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-freeform-app-beta-213032190.html">Freeform digital whiteboard app</a> is finally here, offering a visual collaboration tool for brainstorming sessions and meetings. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-sing-karaoke-160939731.html">Apple Music's karaoke mode</a> is now available and the Weather app now includes a news section. If you use your iPhone to control a smart household, you'll be glad to know that Apple has given the Home app with a new architecture that promises to be faster and more reliable. This may be helpful now that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/matter-smart-home-devices-eve-update-163158992.html">Matter devices are ready</a> (Apple added Matter support in iOS 16.1).</p><p>The company has simultaneously released iPadOS 16.2 and macOS Ventura 13.1. Not surprisingly, these bring cross-platform feature additions like Advanced Data Protection, Freeform and the revised Home app. WatchOS 9.2, meanwhile, adds the Home update as a workout for cyclists and runners wanting to improve their performance on a previously-completed route. These updates won't offer as many conspicuous changes as on the iPhone, but they should still be worthwhile if you're immersed in Apple's ecosystem.</p>

## Instagram launches its BeReal clone, Candid Stories

## 'Avatar: The Way of Water' is the first great high frame rate movie

<p><em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em> is a triumph. As a sequel to the highest-grossing film ever, which was criticized for its formulaic story (and the surprisingly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2014/12/18/avatar-became-the-highest-grossing-film-of-all-time-while-leaving-no-pop-culture-footprint/?sh=e1b5b746159c"><ins>small ripple it had on pop culture</ins></a>), the new movie is a genuine surprise. It's a sweeping epic that reflects on the nature of families, our relationship to the natural world and humanity's endless thirst for violence and plunder. Fans of the original film often had to make excuses for writer and director James Cameron's stilted script, but that's no longer the case for <em>The Way of Water</em>, thanks to additional help from Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa (who both worked on the recent criminally under-loved <em>Planet of the Apes</em> trilogy).</p><p>Perhaps most impressive, though, is that James Cameron has managed to craft the best high frame rate (HFR) movie yet. Certain scenes play back at 48 frames per second, giving them a smoother and more realistic sheen compared to the standard 24fps. That leads to 3D action scenes that feel incredibly immersive — at times HFR can make you forget that the lush alien wildlife on Pandora isn't real.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Avatar: The Way of Water" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/eedc25c0-7af3-11ed-bf7d-20fd7478a0f9" style="height: 1055; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Fox/Disney</div></figure><p>Unlike the handful of high frame rate movies we've already seen – <em>The Hobbit </em>trilogy, as well as Ang Lee's <em>Gemini Man </em>and <em>Billy Lynn's Long Half-Time Walk</em> – the <em>Avatar</em> sequel deploys the technology in a unique way. Rather than using HFR throughout the entire movie, Cameron relies on it for major action sequences, while slower dialog scenes appear as if they're running at 24fps. To do that, the entire film actually runs at 48fps, while the calmer scenes use doubled frames to trick your brain into seeing them at the typical theatrical frame rate.</p><p>If this sounds a bit confusing, your brain may have a similar reaction while watching the film. <em>The Way of Water</em> often jumps from hyper-real HFR to pseudo-24 fps in the same scene — at one point, I counted around a dozen switches in a few minutes. This is a strategy Cameron has been discussing for years. In 2016, he noted that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-31-james-cameron-high-frame-rate-cinema-is-a-tool-not-a-format.html"><ins>HFR is &quot;a tool, not a format,&quot;</ins></a> and later he <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/james-cameron-disagrees-ang-lee-high-frame-rate-avatar-1202184115/"><ins>rejected Ang Lee's attempt</ins></a> at using HFR for <em>Gemini Man's</em> entire runtime.</p><p>Cameron's dual-pronged approach to HFR is bound to be controversial. Even for someone who appreciates what the technology has to offer — pristine 3D action scenes with no blurring or strobing — it took me a while to get used to flipping between high frame rate and 24 fps footage. With <em>Gemini Man</em>, my brain got used to the hyper-reality of HFR within 15 minutes. In <em>The Way of Water, </em>I was almost keeping an eye out for when the footage changed.</p><figure><img alt="Avatar: The Way of Water" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/eedb1451-7af3-11ed-b7c3-fedfd9134d6c" style="height: 1055; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Fox/Disney</div></figure><p>Despite the distracting format changes, <em>The Way of Water’s</em> high frame rate footage ultimately worked for me. At times, the film appears to be a window into the world of Pandora, with breathtaking shots of lush forests and lush oceans. It makes all of Cameron’s creations, from enormous flying fish-like creatures that you can ride, to alien whales with advanced language, appear as if they’re living and breathing creatures. HFR also works in tandem with the sequel's more modern CG animation, making the Na'vi and their culture feel all the more real.</p><p>&nbsp;Over the film’s three hour and twelve-minute runtime, I eventually managed to see what the director was aiming for, even if his ambition exceeded his grasp.&nbsp; (Cameron, who has the world’s first [<em>Avatar</em>] and third-highest grossing films [<em>Titanic</em>] under his belt, and who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-08-01-deepsea-challenge-3d-review.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE119W84-dqQGv8OHXEDnfGt1NDQucvG9vrDjA615vt0SXh5_r_D0ySZ7NYUM7eaUy7U_ToHkYPlDguCCCZAH_vC-D178FxTzqXnO22qrg8Yy8agfPCv40ND6fWS-qqSEBVDzseIKiM68qL4GJPc6pbUKpVdiTVz-pEbgfe6xmqu"><ins>dove into the Marianas Trench</ins></a> in a self-designed personal submarine, suggests you can use the bathroom anytime you want during <em>The Way of Water</em>. You’ll just catch up the next time you see it in theaters. <em>Baller.</em>)</p><p>The re-release of <em>Avatar</em> earlier this month also used a combination of HFR and traditional footage (in addition to brightening the picture and upscaling the film to 4K). But even though that revamp grossed over $70 million on its own, there hasn't been much discussion about how it integrated high frame rate footage. (I saw it on a Regal RPX screen, which offered 3D but no extra frames, sadly.) There's a better chance you'll be able to catch <em>Avatar: The Way of Water </em>exactly how Cameron intended. It'll be screening in 4K, HFR and 3D at all AMC Dolby Cinema locations and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/imax/comments/yyfwq0/avatar_the_way_of_water_imax_frame_rate_guide/"><ins>select IMAX theaters</ins></a> (single laser screens get everything, some dual-laser screens will only offer 2K 3D with HFR). While you <em>could</em> see it in 2D, why would you?</p><section><img alt="Avatar: The Way of Water" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/eedaed40-7af3-11ed-bdfe-ab7c1544a24a" /></section><p>After suffering through the interminable <em>Hobbit</em> movies in HFR, I figured the technology was mostly a waste of time, yet another money-grab that Hollywood can use to pump up ticket prices. Director Peter Jackson struggled to recreate the magic of his <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy, and amid production issues, he also failed to change the way he shot the <em>Hobbit</em> films to account for HFR. So that led to sets that looked like they were ripped from B-grade fantasy movies and costumes that seemingly came from<em>&nbsp;</em>a<em>&nbsp;</em>Spirit Halloween pop-up.</p><p>Ang Lee’s more studious attempts at using the technology, especially with the action scenes in <em>Gemini Man</em>, convinced me HFR still had some potential. But even he struggled along the way. <em>Billy Lynn’s Long Half-Time Walk</em> is a cinematic curiosity, where HFR makes slow dialog scenes appear too distractingly real. <em>Gemini Man</em> was cursed by a messy script and the need to be a big-budget Will Smith blockbuster.</p><figure><img alt="Avatar: The Way of Water" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/eeee9c51-7af3-11ed-bff7-d86a6745fc19" style="height: 1055; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Fox/Disney</div></figure><p><em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em> benefits from the creative failures of all of the earlier high frame rate films. For many, it’ll be their introduction to this technology, so it’ll be interesting to see how general audiences respond. Video games and hyper-real YouTube action footage have made 60fps footage far more common, so I could see younger audiences, those raised on hundreds of hours of <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>, vibing with Cameron’s vision. Everyone else will need more convincing. For me, though, I’m just glad there’s finally a high frame rate film that’s genuinely <em>great</em>, instead of just a technical exercise.</p>

## Arturia's Pigments 4 adds new effects and a simplified interface

<p>At this point it’s easier to list the features that Arturia’s <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/software-instruments/pigments/overview">Pigments</a> doesn’t have than ones it does. The company has been rolling out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-pigments-free-upgrade-soft-synth-35-m1-support-161634255.html">regular updates</a> for a few years now, and each new version adds something worth getting excited about. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-pigments-3-free-update-super-synth-vst-hands-on-163304649.html">New synth engines,</a> new effects, whole new utility sections – it’s both a place for Arturia to experiment with new ideas, and show off some of highlights from its lineup of vintage emulation.</p><p>At first blush Pigments 4 seems like a comparatively minor update. There’s some new effects, a handful of enhancements to the various oscillators, but there’s not much to reach out and demand your attention from a simple headline. This seemingly subtle upgrade hides a lot of quality of life enhancements, though.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For one, now you can simply drag and drop modulation sources to their target. Granted, clicking LFO one and then clicking on the filter cut off wasn’t particularly difficult. But now you can just drag the little tab over an LFO to whatever you want to modulate. It should make Pigments a little less intimidating to those just learning how to navigate the synth. There’s also now left and right arrows on multimode modules, like the filter, that lets you quickly change types, where previously you had to click and open a drop down menu to select a new option.</p><figure><img alt="Arturia Pigments 4" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/9b4259f0-7af0-11ed-b13f-c194dca2541a" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Arturia</div></figure><p>The most dramatic UI changes are thankfully optional. First is the new Play tab, which strips away most of the sound design options and focuses on a core set of tweakable parameters. You can’t change effects here, or set modulation preferences. It’s designed to just get you making noise without too many distractions. It’s fine for live performance or if you prefer to stick with the presets, but hides a lot of the depth that makes Pigments so compelling.&nbsp;</p><p>The other major interface change is a bit of a head scratcher. See, while most companies are rushing to implement dark mode to save your eyes, Arturia has decided that Pigments is <em>too</em> dark and added a light mode. I’m sure there are those out there who will enjoy its bright gray panels, but I’m personally not a fan. Not only do I think the original theme is easier to stare at for prolonged periods of time, but it’s also just more consistent. There are many elements of the interface that remain dark even in light mode and it looks a bit cobbled together.</p><p>That’s a pretty minor nitpick though, considering that once you get past the UX, there’s a handful of new toys to play with in Pigments 4. There’s a new filter borrowed from the company’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-v-collection-9-grows-to-32-virtual-instruments-150052024.html">MS-20 emulation</a>, ring mod in the wavetable oscillator, super unison in the analog oscillator, a dedicated mod oscillator, an improved bit crusher and (wait for it) shimmer reverb!</p><figure><img alt="Arturia Pigments 4" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/9b4232e0-7af0-11ed-b59f-df16e3e628db" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Arturia</div></figure><p>The MS-20 filter might seem unnecessary considering Pigments already had 10 different filter options, many with multiple modes, but it does bring something special to the table. Rather than using it as you would any other lowpass filter, the MS-20 begs to be run at extremes. Crank the resonance and turn on keyboard tracking, and you can transform simple white noise into a delicate plucky key sound with a subtle crackle. Or just crank the volume on it and hit it with the hottest signal you can (though make sure to turn down the master volume or you'll risk blowing out your ears) to get some crunchy saturation.</p><p>Ring Mod delivers some nice icy timbres. Though, this is not something that Pigments was exactly lacking before. It’s a welcome addition, but definitely not something that you’d miss too dearly if it quietly disappeared. The more exciting changes are to the Bit Crusher effect (as opposed to the one built into the sample engine). The addition of jitter, scale and new decimator options really let you fine tune the exact flavor of digital destruction you’re looking for.</p><p>Oh, then of course there’s the shimmer reverb. It does what it says on the tin. Personally I think it’s an essential effect, and I’m shocked Arturia hasn’t added one until now. There’s nothing about it that stands out particularly, but if you’re using Pigments to create <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-efx-fragments-granular-vst-effect-193053457.html">granular soundscapes</a> or ambient plucks, then you’ll be thankful it’s here.</p><p>Arturia also added 63 new wavetables, 67 new samples and 36 new noise types, plus a pile of new presets. And, if the new library of included patches isn’t enough for you, there’s also three new sound packs: Wavelengths Lo-fi, Wavelengths Neuro Bass and Wavelengths Cinematic to broaden your sonic palette.</p><p>Pigments 4 is available now as a free upgrade for existing owners. New customers have a chance to pick it up at an introductory price of $99 until January 4th, after which the price will go back up to $199.</p>

## Scientists achieve fusion ignition, a major milestone in clean energy production

<p>Scientists have just crossed one of the most important thresholds in the quest for fusion energy. A team at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-national-laboratory-makes-history-achieving-fusion-ignition">created</a> the first known fusion reaction with a net energy gain — that is, it produced more energy than it consumed and resulted in ignition. The researchers achieved the feat on December 5th, when they used 192 lasers at the National Ignition Facility to blast a cylinder containing frozen hydrogen surrounded by diamond.</p><p>The reaction, which generated a flurry of X-rays, struck a fuel pellet of deuterium and tritium with 2.05 megajoules of energy. That, in turn, led to a wave of neutron particles and 3.15 megajoules of output. That gain was 'only' equivalent to about 1.5lbs of TNT, but that was enough to meet the criteria for fusion ignition.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="4a5e6f201ce14d08975a037612d6fc06"></div><p>The development has been a long time coming. The National Ignition Facility started work in 2009, but it wasn't until 2014 that the installation's laser-based fusion technology produced a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-02-13-scientists-get-meaningful-energy-from-laser-based-nuclear-fusion.html">meaningful volume of energy</a>. Progress accelerated in the past year, however. Lawrence Livermore generated a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/laser-powered-fusion-energy-breakthrough-134058739.html">much larger amount</a> of energy in a test last August, producing an output equivalent to 70 percent of the energy needed to perform the reaction. An attempt in September generated 1.2 megajoules using the 2.05-megajoule blast.</p><p>The lab and the Energy Department are quick to caution that &quot;many&quot; advancements are still necessary before fusion reactors are practical enough to power homes. During a <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PUVrZTVQYXdVN3JFIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NjA0YTU1NS0yODkxLTQ4ODUtYjllZi1mOGUyYzdmNTI2NzcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZxiaE6Hy6kijQrhRpUJ7pgqDeHFd321p4p_gvjtevDe&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DEke5PawU7rE">presentation</a>, scientists said they needed to improve the number of reactions per minute, simplify the process and otherwise make it easily repeatable. The net energy gain also doesn't include the entire system required to run the laser systems. And of course, the developers need to improve scaling — a reactor would have to power enough households to justify its existence.</p><p>The National Ignition Facility also isn't intended as a generator research program. It's using fusion to test and maintain the US nuclear arsenal. Other organizations and companies will need to cooperate on civilian uses.</p><p>The Energy Department is in the midst of rebooting a coordinated fusion power effort, however. During the event, officials also noted that a functional plant wasn't as far off as you might think. While they didn't commit to a timeframe, they said it was less than the 50 or 60 years they might have predicted in the past. You might see the first commercial fusion reactor in your lifetime, to put it another way.</p><p>The technology could be vital to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/un-emissions-gap-report-climate-change-warning-144323723.html">limiting global warming</a> and otherwise fighting climate change. While renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are more eco-friendly than coal, they don't always meet demand and can require large amounts of land. Solar also isn't as effective in regions where sunlight can be limited. Sufficiently powerful fusion reactors could achieve the dream of clean powerplants that have enough capacity to serve large populations without the radioactive waste of nuclear facilities.</p>

## The best 2-in-1 laptops for 2022

<p>The perfect hybrid machine that’s just as good a tablet as it is a laptop still doesn’t exist. But throughout 2022, companies like Microsoft, Apple and Google continued to improve their operating systems for machines that do double duty. Windows 11 has features that make it friendlier for multi-screen devices, while Android has been better optimized for larger displays. Plus, with the rise of ARM-based chips for laptops, especially Apple’s impressive M series, prospects for a powerful 2-in-1 with a vast touch-friendly app ecosystem is at an all-time high.</p><p>These machines still have their limits, of course. Since they’re smaller than proper laptops, they tend to have less-powerful processors. Keyboards are often less sturdy, with condensed layouts and shallower travel. Plus, they’re almost always tablets first, leaving you to buy a keyboard case separately. (And those ain’t cheap!) So, you can’t always assume the advertised price is what you’ll actually spend on the 2-in-1 you want.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sometimes, getting a third-party keyboard might be just as good, and they’re often cheaper than first-party offerings.

We would usually pick a Surface Go, but the latest model is still too expensive. Other alternatives, like cheaper Android tablets, are underpowered and don’t offer a great multitasking interface. If you want something around $500 that’s thin, lightweight and long-lasting, you’re better off this year looking at a conventional laptop (like those on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html">our best budget PCs list</a>).</p><figure><img alt="Apple iPad Pro 12.9 2020" src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c7370210-25c8-11eb-bfef-f2bf92a9b702" /><figcaption>Chris Velazco / Engadget </figcaption></figure><p>When you’re shopping for a 2-in-1, there are some basic criteria to keep in mind. First, look at the spec sheet to see how heavy the tablet is (alone, and with the keyboard). Most modern hybrids weigh less than 2 pounds, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-pro-9-5g-review-sq3-arm-173012304.html">the 1.94-pound Surface Pro 9</a> being one of the heaviest around. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2022-m2-review-140026198-140026510-140026377-140026181.html">iPad Pro 12.9 (2022)</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s-8-review-in-a-class-of-its-own-132946024.html">Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S8+</a> are both slightly lighter. If the overall weight of the tablet and its keyboard come close to 3 pounds, you’ll be better off just getting an ultraportable laptop.</p><p>You’ll also want to opt for an 11-inch or 12-inch screen instead of a smaller 10-inch model. The bigger displays will make multitasking easier, plus their companion keyboards will be much better spaced. Also, try to get 6GB of RAM if you can for better performance — you’ll find this in the base model of the Galaxy Tab S7+, while this year’s iPad Pro and the Surface Pro 8 start with 8GB of RAM.</p><p>Finally, while some 2-in-1s offer built-in LTE or 5G connectivity, not everyone will want to pay the premium for it. An integrated cellular radio makes checking emails or replying to messages on the go far more convenient. But it also often costs more, and that’s not counting what you’ll pay for data. And, as for 5G — you can hold off on it unless you live within range of a mmWave beacon. Coverage is still spotty and existing nationwide networks use the slower sub-6 technology that’s barely faster than LTE.</p><h2>Best overall: Surface Pro 9 (Intel)</h2><p></p><p>There’s no beating the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NzA3MTYwNS1kNGRmLTQ5NGUtOGQ5Yy1jOWMyMzZiOGJiMzgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi11cy9kL3N1cmZhY2UtcHJvLTkvOTN2a2Q4bnA0ZnZrIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5MTgzMTRhNS1hMGZkLTMzYTAtYjkzMC0xYzMyOGU5ZmFjZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAditFpxk7o-jNnrHRj6Ef83ha3Q8BqT9-E7pLIgCMNlu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-9%2F93vkd8np4fvk">Surface series</a> when it comes to 2-in-1s.

## Flipboard's new community features make it feel more like a social network

<p>After more than a decade, Flipboard is adding a new layer of social features to its platform. The service is adding new commenting and creation tools to its magazines as part of a broader “shift in emphasis towards community and conversations.”</p><p>Flipboard has had commenting features for years, but it’s been fairly basic, and hasn’t been a prominent part of the service, which until now has mostly been known as a place to read and share articles rather than a destination to talk about them. But with its latest update, the company is hoping to turn its signature magazines into the types of communities you might find on Reddit or Twitter.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To start, Flipboard is introducing “notes,” which allow users to add original content — whether it’s photos, videos, links or commentary — and add it to shared magazines. Other members of the magazine can then jump in with their own comments and add to the conversation. The idea, according to Flipboard CEO Mike McCue, is for these notes to become lively areas of discussion for people interested in the same “micro-communities.”</p><p>The company is also adding a new “communities” section to its app, which will highlight magazines and specific curators (Flipboard’s term for the people who manage topic-based magazines) to follow. All the new features are out now on the web, and are launching on its iOS and Android apps in January.</p><p>The company has been quietly testing the updates since July. It says there’s already been a noticeable uptick in engagement in magazines where the new interactivity is enabled.The changes also help make Flipboard into more of an alternative to Twitter for those who primarily use the Elon Musk-run service for consuming news. McCue says that Flipboard’s new social features predate Musk’s takeover of the company, and that he’s still a “Twitter believer.” But he acknowledges Flipboard’s shift is well-timed as some people are increasingly looking for different spaces to interact.</p><p>“It's not like you're in a giant open town square, and everyone's just shouting at the top of their lungs,” McCue tells Engadget. “It's more like we're the little restaurants around the town square and people are at different dinner tables talking. There's a different tone when you have these smaller groups.”</p>

<p>Amazon is rolling out new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-15-review-163035555.html">Echo Show</a> accessibility features today.

## Meta releases an open-source tool that can scan for terrorist content

<p>Meta said it spent $5 billion on global safety and security last year and employs hundreds of people dedicated to anti-terror work. Not every company has those kind of resources, but Meta has <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/12/meta-launches-new-content-moderation-tool/">shared a new open-source tool</a> that can help combat child exploitation, terrorist propaganda and other types of abusive content for free. The tool is called Hasher-Matcher-Actioner (HMA), and it builds on the company's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-02-facebook-open-source-harmful-content-algorithm.html">previous image and video</a> matching software that it also released three years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>HMA can keep websites free of unsavory content with the help of its users who label images and videos that violate rules and laws. The system will create a &quot;hash&quot; or a unique fingerprint of each piece of content that gets saved onto a database. Companies can use the tool to create and run their own databases, but they can also use existing hash databases to make sure they have everything covered. That means they don't have to save the offending images or videos themselves and can simply run all their content through the databases they use to find posts that potentially violate their rules.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meta has shared the tool shortly before it assumes the chair of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) board next month. That's the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-26-facebook-twitter-and-others-band-together-to-fight-online-extre.html">group it formed</a> with Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft to fight online extremism back in 2017. GIFCT runs a database that companies can use with the HMA, and Meta says when &quot;more companies participate in the hash sharing database the better and more comprehensive it is — and the better we all are at keeping terrorist content off the internet, especially since people will often move from one platform to another to share this content.&quot; It added: &quot;...many companies do not have the in-house technology capabilities to find and moderate violating content in high volumes, which is why HMA is a potentially valuable tool.&quot;</p><p>Those interested can checkout the Hasher-Matcher-Actioner tool on <a href="https://github.com/facebook/ThreatExchange/tree/main/hasher-matcher-actioner">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>All I want for Christmas is for my glasses not to fog up. And Swiss scientists might deliver on that wish.

Most protective treatments merely spread water around using hydrophilic molecules, but this nano-thin layer can stop the condensation from even forming.</p><p>The research group believes the layer could also reduce fog on car windshields, and future implementations could work on mirrors, windows and more. The coating lays gold between layers of titanium oxide, which amplifies the heating effect through refraction and protects the gold against wear – titanium is much tougher. And while gold is pricey, the amount needed is so small it shouldn't add much to the price of your glasses if the tech makes its way into mainstream spectacles.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

## SEC charges FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried with 'defrauding investors'

<p>Following his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-arrested-in-bahamas-000800321.html">arrest in the Bahamas</a>, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried with &quot;defrauding investors,&quot; it <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-219">announced</a>. It alleges that Bankman-Fried &quot;concealed his diversion of FTX customers' funds to [the] crypto trading firm Alameda Research while raising more than $1.8 million from investors.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, the US Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also announced charges against Bankman-Fried in parallel actions, according to the SEC.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,&quot; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &quot;The alleged fraud committed by Mr. Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws.&quot;</p><p>The SEC alleges that since at least May 2019, FTX raised $1.8 billion from equity investors, including $1.1 billion from 90 US investors alone. Bankman-Fried promoted the exchange as a safe trading platform with &quot;sophisticated, automated measures to protect customer assets,&quot; it said. In reality, though, Bankman-Fried orchestrated a fraud to conceal the diversion of customer funds to his privately-held crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research.&nbsp;</p><p>That fund was given special treatment, &quot;including an unlimited 'line of credit' funded by the platform's customers and exempting Alameda from certain key FTX risk mitigation measures,&quot; the commissioner added. And finally, customers were exposed to undisclosed risk from FTX's exposure to Alameda holdings of &quot;overvalued, illiquid assets such as FTX-affiliated tokens.&quot; It further alleges that Bankman-Fried used commingled FTX customer funds to make &quot;undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases and large political donations.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Bankman-Fried was set to be testifying today in Congress, but that may not happen now. In a draft transcript of his testimony seen by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/12/13/exclusive-transcript-the-full-testimony-sbf-planned-to-give-to-congress/"><em>Forbes</em></a>, he would have led by saying &quot;I fucked up.&quot; Later in the transcript, Bankman-Fried claims Alameda's position on the platform was twice as large as displayed on FTX's dashboards due to &quot;a historical accounting quirk&quot;, as opposed to any malfeasance. He also planned to say that FTX's US business is fully solvent and could pay back customers immediately. Among other statements, he notes that he was pressured into filing for Chapter 11, and that ultimately the Chapter 11 documents were filed against his wishes.</p><p>The SEC is seeking injunctions including barring Bankman-Fried from future securities dealings, seizing alleged ill-gotten gains, a civil penalty and an officer and director bar. &quot;FTX operated behind a veneer of legitimacy,&quot; said SEC enforcement director Surbir S. Grewal. &quot;But as we allege in our complaint, that veneer wasn’t just thin, it was fraudulent.&quot;</p>

## 'Westworld' and 'The Nevers' will soon be pulled from HBO Max

<p>If you'd been meaning to catch up on <em>Westworld</em> even though it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-cancels-westworld-143349233.html">cancelled before its fifth</a> and final season, you may want to do so soon. The show is leaving the streaming service just over a month after it was cancelled, according to <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/12/westworld-the-nevers-pulled-hbo-max-canceled-1235197233/"><em>Deadline</em></a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/westworld-hbo-max-the-nevers-canceled-1235458657/"><em>Variety</em></a>. <em>The Nevers</em>, the sci-fi series Joss Whedon created for HBO, has also been cancelled and will be removed from the streaming platform before the second half of season one could debut next year.&nbsp;</p><p>As <em>Variety</em> notes, HBO Max owner Warner Bros. Discovery is saving money with this move, as it will no longer have to pay residuals to cast and crew. That, of course, on top of the money it's saving by discontinuing the shows' production. Chief Executive David Zaslav promised investors that the company would find a way to cut $3.5 billion in costs after the $43 billion <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warnermedia-discovery-merger-hbo-max-discovery-plus-214335645.html">WarnerMedia and Discovery merger</a> was finalized earlier this year. The company has been cutting down on spending since then and has cancelled shows other than these two.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Deadline</em> says, however, that it's possible for both Westworld and The Nevers to come back as offerings on another one of the company's platforms. Zaslav previously talked about entering the free ad-supported TV streaming space, and the sci-fi shows could apparently be offered on a future service with that business model. If that does happen, the second half of <em>The Nevers</em> — a show set in Victorian London that follows a group of women who manifest abnormal abilities — will debut on that service. It remains to be seen if we're going to see the ending <em>Westworld's</em> showrunners envisioned for it. The show's fifth season didn't get the chance to start production, unlike <em>The Nevers</em> that's already done shooting the back half of its first season.</p>

## Twitter disbands its Trust and Safety Council of external advisors

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-monday-11-per-month-ios-221436172.html">Twitter</a> has dissolved its Trust and Safety Council via email and less than an hour before its members' Zoom meeting with the company's executives, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/12/12/musk-twitter-harass-yoel-roth/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/12/1142399312/twitter-trust-and-safety-council-elon-musk"><em>NPR</em></a>. The council was reportedly supposed to discuss recent developments and changes on the website under Elon Musk, but the email said that the members' help is no longer needed. Its members were apparently informed that Twitter is "reevaluating how best to bring external insights" and that the council is no longer "the best structure to do this."</p><p>The company disbanded the group just a few days after three members resigned from their voluntary positions. In their letter, <a href="https://twitter.com/annecollier/status/1600889250761027585">they said</a> the well-being of Twitter's users is on the decline despite Musk's claims and that the executive should not be allowed to define digital safety. In a response to the news of their departure, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1601275244710621184">tweeted</a>: "It is a crime that they refused to take action on child exploitation for years!" After that tweet, <em>NPR</em> said some remaining members sent a letter to Twitter demanding the company to stop misrepresenting the council's role, as attacks against former and current advisors continued to grow worse.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Trust and Safety Council members aren't employees handling moderation on the website, and they have no power to make decisions or to review banned accounts and specific tweets. They're a group of external advisors from expert and anti-abuse organizations, including the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children, YAKIN (Youth Adult Survivors &amp; Kin in Need), the Samaritans and GLAAD, volunteering their time to help Twitter figure out how to fight hate and harassment. When Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-09-twitter-safety-council.html">formed the council</a> in 2016, it said the group's purpose is to make the website a less toxic place so that "anyone, anywhere can express themselves safely and confidently."&nbsp;</p><p>More members were on the verge of resigning before the group was dissolved, Larry Magid, chief executive of Silicon Valley nonprofit ConnectSafely, told <em>The Post</em>. He said: "By disbanding [the council], we got fired instead of quit. Elon doesn’t want criticism, and he really doesn’t want the kind of advice he would very likely get from a safety advisory council, which would likely tell him to rehire some of the staff he got rid of, and reinstate some of the rules he got rid of, and turn the company in another direction from where he is turning it."</p><p>Musk said in October that he will form a "moderation council" made up of members with "widely diverse viewpoints" before he reinstates banned accounts. But in an interview in November, he <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PWxkSzZFRXJwN21JIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1Yjc4OTU0NS01YWZlLTRjMDQtODQxYS0wOTBiMzhmMGNhNGUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYXEjGzwNeP_vqabxfV3bsox3V_kbwQt6nEcucsIDc6h&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DldK6EErp7mI">admitted</a> that he will still have the final say in making decisions. Twitter has yet to introduce a moderation council, but Musk has already reinstated previously banned accounts', such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-donald-trump-unbanned-elon-musk-023043690.html">Donald Trump's</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-restores-andrew-anglins-account-192658758.html">Andrew Anglin's</a>, the neo-Nazi creator of <em>The Daily Stormer</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looks like embattled FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried won't be testifying (virtually) before Congress after all. The Bahamas Attorney General's Office <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/sam-bankman-fried-arrested-bahamas-prosecutor/story?id=95105184">announced Monday</a> that Bankman-Fried has been arrested there and is likely to be extradited in short measure back to the US to stand trial.

However, as United States Attorney Damian Williams explained in a Tweet Monday, Bankman-Fried has been taken into custody &quot;based on a sealed indictment,&quot; which will be revealed and explained in the morning.</p><p>“Clearly, I made a lot of mistakes. There are things I would give anything to be able to do over again,” Bankman-Fried recently tried to explain to the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8wMS9idXNpbmVzcy9kZWFsYm9vay9zYW0tYmFua21hbi1mcmllZC1kZWFsYm9vay1pbnRlcnZpZXctdHJhbnNjcmlwdC5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMWJiN2E3Mi1hYThkLTQ2ODktOGQ3Zi04ZWIyMTRjYjZjYzMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWugCynsDpFl3Vkld5RExnUsDYKycJAvbaNzv55Ij-b6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2022%2F12%2F01%2Fbusiness%2Fdealbook%2Fsam-bankman-fried-dealbook-interview-transcript.html&amp;uuid=UD3o8O66ZwiTOPde0375"><em>New York Times</em></a>. “I did not ever try to commit fraud on anyone.”&nbsp;</p><p>The Bahamian government is also being accused of collusion — not by the DoJ, but rather FTX itself. Attorneys for the company <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.188450/gov.uscourts.deb.188450.203.0.pdf">asserted on Monday</a> (ahead of the arrest news) that the Bahamas as a governing entity had colluded with Bankman-Fried to help move the ill-gotten funds from all those suspicious transactions that took place right before bankruptcy into crypto-wallets controlled by Bahamian regulators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Bankman-Fried stepped down from his role of CEO at FTX in November and was replaced by John J. Ray III, an executive who was also helmed Enron through its own bankruptcy proceedings. In his prepared remarks for Tuesday's now-postponed congressional hearings, Ray painted a bleak picture of FTX's late stage management and operations.&nbsp;</p><p>In it he says that FTX went on a $5 billion spending spree in late 2021 and early 2022, &quot;buying a myriad of businesses and investments, many of which may be worth only a fraction of what was paid for them,&quot; as well as making numerous loans and payments amounting to more than $1 billion, &quot;to insiders.&quot; Those funds were also co-mingled with money from Bankman-Fried's other venture Alameda Research, which also used client funds to engage in high-risk margin trading.&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on what the Southern District Attorney's office unseals tomorrow, Bankman-Fried could be going away for a very long time. Former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes and COO Sunny Balwani just got 11 and 12 years in prison, respectively, for their roles in the medical company's massive fraud case. Ponzi Scheme king Bernie Madoff got 150 years for his shenanigans in 2009, and in 2006, Jeff Skilling was handed 24 years for his role in Enron's downfall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p><em>Developing...</em></p>
