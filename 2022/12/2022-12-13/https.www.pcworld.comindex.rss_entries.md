<p>Opera today has added Lucid Mode to its browser&mdash;an automatic feature that will sharpen and clarify older video on a variety of sites.</p>



<p>Opera didn&rsquo;t say what version of its desktop browser Lucid would be added to, but you&rsquo;ll be sure to get it if you keep Opera up to date. </p>



<p>When users open a video, on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter, a floating button will appear on the video, Opera said in a statement. &ldquo;Once turned on, Lucid Mode will add sharpness and clarity so that content can be enjoyed as it was meant to be&mdash;in comfort and relaxation, without the hassle or stress of poor quality impeding the experience,&rdquo; it said.</p>



<p>Opera didn&rsquo;t say exactly how it would apply the video updates&mdash;whether they browser would improve the video as it played through the browser app itself, or if Opera was adding server-side improvements like a VPN. In any case, Opera believes that users will benefit from being able to see older videos in a brighter, clearer format.</p>



<p>Opera has added innovations in the past, like an integrated VPN. Company executives say they treat the browser like a &ldquo;super app,&rdquo; providing more enhancements than just surfing the web. It&rsquo;s just one of the reasons we suggest that you may want to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/798153/10-innovative-opera-features-that-lured-me-away-from-chrome.html">quit Google Chrome and switch to using Opera instead</a>. </p>

Its compact reference design and use of traditional 8-pin power connectors lets it fit into most PCs easily as well. AMD&rsquo;s latest also offers acceptable ray tracing performance, though Nvidia holds its lead. The XTX isn&rsquo;t perfect&mdash;some sporadic bugs did appear during our tests&mdash;but overall it&rsquo;s a very good card without a price premium over last gen.</p>
</div>


<p>The war for the next-generation of graphics supremacy is finally <em>on</em>. AMD&rsquo;s new RDNA 3-powered $999 Radeon RX 7900 XTX and $899 Radeon 7900 XT finally hit streets on Tuesday, December 13, primed for battle with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s monstrous GeForce RTX 4090</a>. To cut right to the chase: In many ways, this launch is very reminiscent of the battle between last-gen&rsquo;s Radeon RX 6900 XT and RTX 3090.</p>



<p>Despite costing hundreds less, AMD&rsquo;s Radeon RX 7900 XTX comes within spitting distance of the $1,600 RTX 4090 in many games, meeting or even beating it in some titles&mdash;just like last generation. Ray tracing is also no longer a weakness, with the 7900 XTX on par with the 3090&rsquo;s formerly best-in-class performance but trailing behind Nvidia&rsquo;s latest ferocious capabilities&mdash;just like last generation. New capabilities unlock specialized experiences when you pair AMD&rsquo;s latest Radeon GPUs with its latest Ryzen processors&mdash;just like last generation.</p>



<p>But this time around, there&rsquo;s a big difference. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX isn&rsquo;t in competition with the RX 4090, despite its ability to go toe-to-toe with Nvidia&rsquo;s juggernaut. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html">ludicrously priced $1,200 GeForce RTX 4080</a> is. Nvidia slapped the card with a mammoth <em>$500 dollar </em>price increase gen-over-gen, while AMD stuck to the same $999 for its flagship card. And both members of the 7900 duo meet or beat the RTX 4080&rsquo;s performance at those cheaper MSRPs.</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s dig in.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Further reading: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1433026/xfx-speedster-merc-310-7900-xtx-review.html">XFX Speedster Merc 310 7900 XTX review: Worth every penny</a></em></p></blockquote>



<h2 class="toc" id="radeon-rx-7900-xtx-and-xt-specs-price-and-features">Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT specs, price, and features</h2>



<p>AMD radically reconfigured its underlying GPU architecture with RDNA 3. The most striking change? This is the first Ryzen-like chiplet-based GPU ever created.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX reveal" class="wp-image-1370457" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AMD-RDNA-3-Radeon-RX-7900-XTX-8.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>



<p>Previously, GPUs were built using huge &ldquo;monolithic&rdquo; dies that cram all necessary bits inside.&nbsp;But with RDNA 3 the main 5nm core graphics die is flanked by up to six complementary memory dies. Built using the more mature and cost-efficient 6nm process, these house the GPU&rsquo;s on-chip Infinity Cache and memory controllers. The design helps AMD keep costs down on both nodes, and no doubt helps the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT achieve their more palatable prices. The central RDNA 3 GPU die measures just 300mm squared, while Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 4090 die is over twice as large. All of the 4090 die is made using TSMC&rsquo;s expensive cutting-edge node, too.</p>



<p>AMD also overhauled RDNA 3&rsquo;s ray tracing capabilities to offer up to 50 percent more performance in those cutting-edge lighting effects; added a pair of AI accelerators in each compute unit (which will likely come into play when FSR 3.0 lands in 2023); tuned the Infinity Cache for enhanced performance; introduced a new &ldquo;Radiance Display Engine&rdquo; that supports HDMI 2.1a, USB-C, and DisplayPort 2.1 (unlike the RTX 40-series); amped up the &ldquo;dual&rdquo; media engine with AV1 encoding (yay!) and simultaneous AVC/HEVC encode/decode; and more&mdash;including switching to a newly &ldquo;unified&rdquo; compute unit.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD RDNA 3 Radeon details" class="wp-image-1370469" height="668" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rdna-3-display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>We&rsquo;re not going to bog down this review with the full details, though. Our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1370428/amd-rdna-3-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-reveal.html">initial Radeon RX 7900 XTX reveal coverage</a> has all the technical info you need if you want to wade in deeper. This review focuses on more practical matters.</p>



<p>That starts with the technical configuration details of the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT, and how they compare against last-generation&rsquo;s Radeon RX 6900 XT flagship. As you can see, AMD crammed <em>a lot, lot more</em> of those more advanced CUs into these RDNA 3 chips:</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Radeon RX 7900 series specs" class="wp-image-1431961" height="666" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/specs-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>A couple other practical technical tidbits are worth calling out here. First, AMD learned its lessons from RDNA 2. While Infinity Cache works wonders for boosting performance in many games, at higher resolutions, you <em>need</em> ample VRAM and wide memory busses to tackle high-performance textures with grace. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX packs 24GB of GDDR6, while the 7900 XT offers 20GB, well above the 16GB found in the RTX 4080 and last-gen&rsquo;s 6900 XT. It&rsquo;s overkill but content creators will love it, and they&rsquo;re paired with much wider 384-bit and 320-bit (respectively) buses than before. Between that and Infinity Cache, memory isn&rsquo;t an issue with the 7900 series, full stop.</p>



<p>Also pay attention to the power draw of the flagship XTX model. While the $899 Radeon RX 7900 XT consumes a bit <em>less </em>power than its predecessor, the $999 7900 XTX cranks up the juice to compete with Nvidia&rsquo;s latest and greatest. AMD recommends using an 800-watt power supply at minimum, and in our power testing benchmarks, we discovered that the XTX only draws a hair less power than the ferocious RTX 4090. Yes, this card is more efficient than prior GPU generations, but it&rsquo;s still power-hungry.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX reveal" class="wp-image-1371301" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSCF2126.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>



<p>&hellip;.Which makes the relatively tiny size of AMD&rsquo;s in-house GPUs all the more noteworthy. Nvidia and its partners slapped gargantuan 3- or 4-slot coolers on their 4080 and 4090 cards, powered by the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1372988/heres-what-we-know-about-the-geforce-rtx-4090-12vhpwr-cables-melting.html">melty new 12VHPWR connectors.</a> Though custom RX 7900 boards also go big, AMD&rsquo;s offerings stick to a modest 2.5-slot design that &ldquo;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhPnqr6-cSo&amp;xcust=2-1-1431755-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">fits in <em>everything</em></a>,&rdquo; per small form factor PC guru Optimum Tech. That&rsquo;s great for compatibility with existing PCs.</p>



<p>Also great: AMD&rsquo;s Radeon RX 7900 series reference cards use just two traditional 8-pin power connectors. The cards sport dual DisplayPort 2.1 connections, a singular HDMI 2.1a port, and a USB-C connection compatible with DP 2.1 as well. Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 40-series lack USB-C, and most custom RX 7900 series cards we&rsquo;ve seen so far swap it out for a standard DP 2.1 connection. So if that&rsquo;s a key feature for you, AMD&rsquo;s reference cards are the ones to target.</p>

<p>Of course, these cards also support AMD&rsquo;s abundant software features, some of which are only available when paired with an AMD Ryzen CPU. Those include <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/919457/amd-fsr-1-0-vs-fsr-2-0.html">FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0 and 2.0 upscaling tech</a> and its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/623910/amd-adrenalin-radeon-super-resolution-is-here-to-speed-up-your-games.html">universal Radeon Super Resolution</a> cousin, the performance-boosting <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394720/faster-gaming-frame-rates-for-free-resizable-bar-explained.html">Smart Access Memory</a>, a new Smart Access Video feature for accelerating encoding tasks (which we hope to test soon), Radeon Anti-Lag for reduced latency, AMD Noise Suppression to eliminate background noise during video calls and streams, AMD Link to beam gameplay to other devices, Radeon Boost, power-saving Radeon Chill, Radeon Image Sharpening, AMD Privacy View, and more. They&rsquo;re all great options to have at hand.</p>



<p>But enough talk. Let&rsquo;s get to the benchmarks. Giddy-up.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="our-test-system">Our test system</h2>



<p>We evaluate graphics cards on an AMD Ryzen 5900X PC used exclusively for benchmarking GPUs. We now test with PCIe Resizable BAR (also known as Smart Access Memory on Ryzen systems) active, as most modern gaming PCs released in the last four years support the performance-boosting feature, either natively or via a motherboard firmware update. Nvidia also recommends turning on the optional &ldquo;Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling&rdquo; option in Windows to let the RTX 40-series stretch its legs to the fullest, so we&rsquo;ve made that tweak as well. Most of the hardware was provided by the manufacturers, but we purchased the storage ourselves.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re comparing AMD&rsquo;s Radeon RX 7900 series against the $1,200 Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 and $1,600 RTX 4090, their natural next-gen rivals. We&rsquo;ve also included benchmarks from the last-gen Radeon RX 6900 XT, as well as Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 3080, 3080 Ti, and 3090, to show generational improvements. All of these cards remain solid 4K offerings, even the last-gen models.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX reveal" class="wp-image-1371299" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSCF2136.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>



<p>We&rsquo;ve also updated the games in our testing suite for this new generation. Our lineup of games spans various engines, genres, vendor sponsorships (Nvidia, AMD, and Intel), and graphics APIs (DirectX 9, 11, DX12, and Vulkan), in an effort to represent a full range of performance potential. Each title is run using its in-game benchmark, sanity checked by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/frameview/&amp;xcust=2-1-1431755-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Nvidia&rsquo;s FrameView tool</a>, at the highest possible graphics presets unless otherwise noted, with VSync, frame rate caps, real-time ray tracing or DLSS effects, and FreeSync/G-Sync disabled, along with any other vendor-specific technologies like FidelityFX tools or Nvidia Reflex. We&rsquo;ve also enabled temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) to push these cards to their limits.</p>



<p>Each benchmark gets run at least three times, with the average result for each test listed as the final result. Outside of esports, we&rsquo;ve limited our benchmarks to 4K and 1440p resolutions, as those are the natural fits for these bruising GPUs. Most cost four figures or more at launch. Pay close attention to how the 7900 XTX and RTX 4090 trade blows at both resolutions&mdash;in most cases, AMD&rsquo;s card is faster at 1440p resolution than the Nvidia card that costs $600 more (thanks Infinity Cache!), while 4K performance varies wildly. Sometimes the 7900 duo struggles to surpass the RTX 4080, while other times it can meet (and, rarely, beat) even the 4090.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="gaming-performance-benchmarks">Gaming performance benchmarks</h2>



<h3 id="esports-and-older-apis">Esports and older APIs</h3>



<p>Let&rsquo;s kick things off with a pair of ultra-popular esports games, and a tactical strategy game running on DX11.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Radeon RX 7900 series benchmarks" class="wp-image-1431776" height="1068" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/codmw2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Radeon RX 7900 series benchmarks" class="wp-image-1431765" height="1080" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/total-war-troy.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s a killer start for RDNA 3. In <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em>, the Radeon RX 7900 series mops the floor with the 4080 at all resolutions, with the XTX tying or surpassing the 4090. Things get a bit more complicated in the ever-popular <em>CSGO</em>, where Nvidia&rsquo;s Ada Lovelace architecture flexes a bit more, delivering unrivaled 1080p performance. The $899 7900 XT manages to slightly trump the $1,200 RTX 4080 at all other resolutions, however, while the XTX beats the 4090 at 1440p, but gets edged at 1080p and whomped at 4K. These are all fantastically fast cards for <em>CSGO </em>though&mdash;even the last-gen models.</p>



<p>AMD&rsquo;s new GPUs are clearly favored in the DX11-powered <em>Total War Troy</em> on the other hand, with the XT breezing ahead of the 4080 and the XTX taking the vaunted 4090 down completely.</p>



<h3 id="dx12-and-vulkan">DX12 and Vulkan</h3>



<p>With that out of the way, let&rsquo;s turn to the more modern DX12 and Vulkan graphics APIs being used in many (most?) triple-A games these days. Once again, pay close attention to how the various Radeon RX 7900 series and RTX 40-series GPUs stack up against each other, at both resolutions. We won&rsquo;t dive into a play-by-play for all of these games, but performance can vary greatly depending on the game and resolution. Peep those <em>Gears Tactics </em>results for an extreme example.</p>

<p>Taking the most wild game-to-game fluctuations out of the picture, in general, AMD&rsquo;s GPUs tend to have an advantage at 1440p, while Nvidia&rsquo;s still own 4K&mdash;but that&rsquo;s not a universal truth.</p>



<h2 id="skittering-bugs">Skittering bugs</h2>



<p>Now for a mild awkward note: We encountered several bugs during our testing. None proved severe or pervasive, aside from <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> constantly crashing at 1440p resolution with FSR 2 enabled, but we don&rsquo;t usually bump into oddities quite so regularly during reviews. That said, they tend to be more common at the introduction of a new GPU architecture (like RDNA 3) and usually get mopped up quickly, and we&rsquo;ve already made AMD aware of these issues. The bugs we encountered are:</p>



<ul><li><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> benchmark consistently crashes with FSR 2 Balanced at 1440p resolution. This affects prior-gen Radeon GPUs as well. AMD says a fix is being investigated, but to use the FSR Quality preset as a workaround in the meantime.</li><li><em>Hitman 3</em> benchmark crashes sporadically at the same 1440p, FSR 2 Balanced settings, but only sometimes, and only on the Radeon RX 7900 XTX.</li><li>In one <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em> benchmark run out of 15 with the $899 7900 XT, something glitched and all the buildings rendered in neon rainbow for some reason&mdash;pretty trippy and cool, but not ideal. Fortunately, it didn&rsquo;t resurface again in any other runs, or in several hours of playing <em>COD </em>multiplayer with the more powerful XTX.</li></ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Call of Duty: MW2 visual corruption with Radeon RX 7900 series" class="wp-image-1431779" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20221207092206_1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Call of Duty: MW2 visual corruption with Radeon RX 7900 series" class="wp-image-1431773" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20221207092216_1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<ul><li>Twice, games refused to recognize the 7900 XT, reverting to a &ldquo;Windows DirectX Render Device&rdquo; instead and drastically reducing performance. Running DDU and reinstalling the drivers fixed the issues both times, but I&rsquo;ve never seen that before.</li></ul>



<p>Bottom line? You might run into infrequent bugs during the early days of the new Radeon RX 7900 series, especially if you&rsquo;re using FSR 2.1 Balanced to increase 1440p gaming performance. None were true showstoppers, however. While bugs are always irritating, I don&rsquo;t feel these minor, sporadic ones diminish the 7900 XTX and XT&rsquo;s overall appeal, especially with AMD already working to squash them.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="radeon-rx-7900-xtx-and-xt-ray-tracing-benchmarks">Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT ray tracing benchmarks</h2>



<p>We also need to dig into the Radeon RX 7900-series&rsquo; raw ray tracing performance. AMD substantially overhauled how RDNA 3 handles ray tracing, enhancing not only the raw performance of its RT accelerators, but also adding a pair of dedicated AI accelerators per CU for the first time. Those AI accelerators aren&rsquo;t doing much now, but you have to think they&rsquo;ll be a big part of the next-gen FSR 3.0 already teased to launch in 2023. Read our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1370428/amd-rdna-3-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-reveal.html">initial Radeon RX 7900 series coverage</a> for a deeper dive into the architectural changes AMD made with RDNA 3.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD RDNA 3 Radeon details" class="wp-image-1370475" height="672" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rdna-3-ray-tracing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>Want a pre-benchmark TL;DR? AMD made huge strides here, with the Radeon RX 7900 XTX meeting the last-gen RTX 3090&rsquo;s ray tracing performance levels&mdash;a.k.a. the best ever until a couple months ago. Ray tracing is no longer a weakness for AMD, though it remains a clear Nvidia strength. That makes sense, as Nvidia is a generation ahead, having introduced RT and AI hardware in the RTX 20-series years ago. It&rsquo;s worth noting that AMD&rsquo;s FSR upscaling technology is seeing a rapid uptick in adoption now that it&rsquo;s established. At the RTX 4090&rsquo;s launch, most of the ray-traced games in our testing suite supported Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS, but not any iteration of FSR. Now, only <em>Watch Dogs Legion</em> lacks it (which is why AMD&rsquo;s cards show a 0 score there). Huzzah to more options that cover more gamers!</p>



<p>The charts below show the raw performance of the tested GPUs in the selected games with ray tracing off, to get a baseline. Next, we show performance with all available ray tracing effects active and set to Ultra. The important thing to note here is how these ray-traced frame rates compare proportionally to the game running with RT off, which reveals how efficient each GPU&rsquo;s raw ray tracing capabilities are. (If a game runs at 100fps with ray tracing <em>off</em>, and two different GPUs run the game with ray tracing <em>on</em> at 50fps and 25fps, for example, the former GPU offers better raw ray tracing chops.)</p>



<p>Finally, since these cutting-edge lighting effects send frame rates plummeting, pairing ray tracing with some sort of image upscaling technology (like Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS, AMD&rsquo;s FSR 2, and Intel&rsquo;s XeSS) is often a necessity. We&rsquo;ve also included performance metrics with <strong>DLSS or FSR running in balanced mode</strong> to show the sort of full-stack ray tracing performance you&rsquo;ll see in the real world. Running FSR/DLSS in Performance or Ultra Performance mode would result in even higher frame rates, but with potentially more image oddities. We like the balance of speed and fidelity that DLSS Balanced provides.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve also included a chart below showing <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> 4K performance with FSR 2/DLSS Balanced on the various GPUs. That game lacks ray tracing, but it&rsquo;s graphically intense, and these results can show us the sort of speed boosts we can expect using the upscaling technologies on newer cards versus older ones. (One caveat: As mentioned in the <strong>Bugs</strong> section, <em>RDR2 </em>currently crashes on all AMD GPUs when trying to run at 1440p with FSR Balanced mode enabled. Use Quality mode instead for now at that resolution.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Radeon RX 7900 series benchmarks" class="wp-image-1431766" height="1087" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/rt-rdr2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>Across the board, RTX 40-series GPUs get about 30 more frames per second with DLSS Balanced, on, while older RTX 30-series GPUs get 20fps&mdash;clearly showing improved efficiency in Nvidia&rsquo;s latest generation of dedicated AI tensor cores, which power DLSS. AMD&rsquo;s FSR 2 runs on standard GPU shaders rather than requiring specialized hardware and boosts frame rates by about 30fps on the 7900 duo and the older Radeon RX 6900 XT alike.</p>



<p>All of these upscaling technologies look great in practice, though <em>F1 22</em>&rsquo;s use of the much simpler FSR 1.0 upscaling results in a more shimmering picture at 1440p resolution. It&rsquo;ll be adding FSR 2.0 soon however. One thing Radeon GPUs won&rsquo;t be getting? <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html#toc-5">DLSS 3 Frame Generation</a>, a stunning technical achievement that&rsquo;s already a real weapon in Nvidia&rsquo;s arsenal despite being in its early days. AMD has no answer for it and it can be a huge boon if you&rsquo;re trying to fuel a high-refresh rate 4K monitor.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="power-and-thermals">Power and thermals</h2>



<p>We test power draw by looping the&nbsp;<em>F1 22</em>&nbsp;benchmark at 4K for about 20 minutes after we&rsquo;ve benchmarked everything else (to warm up the GPU) and noting the highest reading on our Watts Up Pro meter, which measures the power consumption of our entire test system. The initial part of the race, where all competing cars are onscreen simultaneously, tends to be the most demanding portion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This isn&rsquo;t a worst-case test; this is a GPU-bound game running at a GPU-bound resolution to gauge performance when the graphics card is sweating hard. If you&rsquo;re playing a game that also hammers the CPU, you could see higher overall system power draws. Consider yourself warned.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="XFX Speedster Merc 310 Radeon RX 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1433081" height="1199" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/power-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1183" width="1183" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>Well well well, isn&rsquo;t this a surprise. AMD has been touting the efficiency gains in RDNA 3 and smack-talking Nvidia&rsquo;s move to 12VHPWR power connectors, but as you can see here, both 7900 XT models draw more power than the RTX 4080, though the XT is neck-and-neck. The 7900 XTX sucks down roughly as much juice as the power-hungry RTX 3090 and while it&rsquo;s decently behind the the new RTX 4090, the whole system still draws well over 500W under load.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s not necessarily bad&mdash;remember, AMD&rsquo;s 7900 GPUs are always faster in game performance than the RTX 4080, and very often rivals (sometimes even beating) the RTX 4090, so the increased power draw makes sense. The XT draws roughly the same power as the 4080 (and less than the 6900 XT) while offering significantly higher performance, highlighting RDNA 3&rsquo;s improved efficiency.</p>



<p>We test thermals by leaving GPU-Z open during the&nbsp;<em>F1 22</em>&nbsp;power draw test, noting the highest maximum temperature at the end.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Radeon RX 7900 series temps" class="wp-image-1431787" height="1094" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/temps-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>Here&rsquo;s where AMD&rsquo;s decision to stick to a traditionally sized card affects the Radeon RX 7900-series. Yes, they&rsquo;ll fit into most any PC, but even though AMD&rsquo;s reference GPUs are incredibly dense and heavy in-hand, the much larger Nvidia (and XFX) GPUs do a better job at dissipating heat. You can&rsquo;t see it much in the raw numbers, as sub-70-degree maximums are fine regardless, but you can definitely hear AMD&rsquo;s reference cards under load. (It&rsquo;s a pleasant enough sound, though&mdash;not too shrill, or too loud.) Our Radeon RX 7900 XTX review unit also exhibited coil whine in several circumstances.</p>



<p>The Nvidia RTX 40-series GPUs and XFX&rsquo;s custom 7900 XTX rely on far bulkier cooling designs that run both cool and <em>very </em>quiet&mdash;damned near silent. AMD definitely made a trade-off opting for a smaller construction, but since the 7900&rsquo;s sound profile isn&rsquo;t obnoxious, it feels worthwhile to ensure smaller RNDA 3 cards are available. That said, if you want truly silent running, you&rsquo;ll need to pony up for a larger custom 7900.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="should-you-buy-the-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-and-xt">Should you buy the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT?</h2>



<p>Most people should definitely opt for the $899 Radeon RX 7900 XT and $999 Radeon RX 7900 XTX over Nvidia&rsquo;s $1,200 GeForce RTX 4080. Heck, many people would be happy picking up the XTX over Nvidia&rsquo;s juggernaut RTX 3090 for <em>$600 less</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX reveal" class="wp-image-1370461" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AMD-RDNA-3-Radeon-RX-7900-XTX-7.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>



<p>AMD&rsquo;s duo offers more performance in traditional games and much more memory for <em>hundreds</em> of dollars less than the 4080. Plus, the XTX offers ray tracing performance on par with Nvidia&rsquo;s best-in-class last generation GPU, the RTX 3090. FSR 2.0 is also quickly being embraced by games that deploy the cutting-edge lighting effects, giving you even more performance. You can also flip on AMD&rsquo;s universal Radeon Super Resolution upscaling feature in any game that <em>doesn&rsquo;t </em>support FSR for even higher performance, and it looks great at the 4K resolutions the 7900 series targets. These cards as pricey as hell but deliver outstanding value versus the Team Green competition.</p>



<p>These reference Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT cards also win in terms of compatibility, thanks to their slim yet attractive 2.5-slot design and dual 8-pin connectors. These fit into virtually any PC, unlike the massive 3- and 4-slot RTX options, which also require the use of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1372988/heres-what-we-know-about-the-geforce-rtx-4090-12vhpwr-cables-melting.html">finicky new 12VHPWR power cable adapters</a>&mdash;though their small size also makes them more audible under load than larger GPUs.</p>



<p>Enough said, right? Not quite.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX reveal" class="wp-image-1371305" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSCF2095.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>



<p>Ray tracing isn&rsquo;t a weakness for Radeon anymore, but it remains a strength for GeForce. AMD&rsquo;s second-gen RT implementation in the 7900 series caught up to the RTX 3090&rsquo;s second-gen prowess, but the RTX 4080 and 4090 pushed the advantage even further, to the point that you don&rsquo;t even <em>have</em> to use DLSS to hit 60fps in most 4K/Ultra ray-traced games (though you should to push frame rates even higher). That&rsquo;s amazing, and AMD can&rsquo;t compare.</p>



<p>AMD also can&rsquo;t compete against Nvidia&rsquo;s awesome new DLSS 3 Frame Generation feature, which inserts AI-created frames between every other image for unparalleled visual smoothness and the ability to shatter CPU bottlenecks. Team Red does plan to release FSR 3 with AI-created &ldquo;Fluid Motion Frames&rdquo; sometime in 2023, however.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX reveal" class="wp-image-1370460" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AMD-RDNA-3-Radeon-RX-7900-XTX-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>



<p>If you care about peak ray tracing performance and want to get in on the AI frame hype train sooner rather than later, you may want to opt for a 4080 instead (though I&rsquo;d strongly suggest against it after Nvidia jacked its price up by a staggering $500 over the 3080). Or even the GeForce RTX 4090, which boasts those features <em>and</em> ferocious overall performance&mdash;it&rsquo;s the ultimate no-compromises GPU of this generation. That&rsquo;s especially true for prosumers who can put its dual AV1 encoders and 24GB of ultra-fast GDDR6X VRAM to proper work. You&rsquo;ll pay dearly for it though: $600 more than the 7900 XTX.</p>



<p>That said, while ray tracing is picking up steam, it&rsquo;s only a must-use feature in a handful of games, like <em>Cyberpunk 2077, Metro Exodus, Minecraft RTX, </em>and <em>Control</em>. <em>Portal RTX </em>also looks dope as heck (and requires DLSS 3 Frame Gen to run effectively). If it&rsquo;s more of a nice-to-have feature for your gameplay needs, AMD&rsquo;s Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT are much better values.</p>



<p><em>That </em>that said, we&rsquo;re currently in a weird time for GPUs, with a glut of last-gen models flooding the market after the pandemic-fueled crypto bubble burst. Most people don&rsquo;t need a $1,000 graphics card. If you aren&rsquo;t looking to push frame rates on a high-refresh 4K monitor, last-gen GPUs like the 6900 XT and Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 3080 are still solid practical options for 4K/60 and high-refresh 1440p displays, and they can usually be found for around $600 to $750 online. They&rsquo;re great if you don&rsquo;t need the latest and greatest. You can save a few hundred more bucks now that the GPU crunch has subsided, and even try to risk holding out for even deeper discounts.</p>



<p>Our guide to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">best graphics cards for gaming</a> can help you make the best decision for <em>you</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX reveal" class="wp-image-1370465" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AMD-RDNA-3-Radeon-RX-7900-XTX-6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>



<p>Bottom line? AMD&rsquo;s Radeon RX 7900 XT and XTX deliver staggering performance, ample memory, easy compatibility, and software features galore for far less than Nvidia&rsquo;s latest. They may not unseat the RTX 4090 as the towering raw performance champion, especially if you&rsquo;re interested in ray tracing, but unlike Nvidia&rsquo;s price-jacked yet performance-lacking RTX 4080, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX offers stunning value over its predecessor for the same price as before. The 7900 XT, on the other hand, delivers <em>worse</em> value than the flagship and no doubt would&rsquo;ve been called the 7800 XT (and sold for significantly less) if Nvidia hadn&rsquo;t already pushed pricing to insane levels with the RTX 4080. Neither the 4080 nor the 7900 XT are particularly appealing at these prices. If you&rsquo;re already considering spending $899 for the XT, we&rsquo;d advise saving up some extra pennies and grabbing the $999 XTX instead if you can. It offers a lot more performance in some situations, like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> with ray tracing enabled.</p>



<p>After Nvidia&rsquo;s next-gen reveal, my colleague Michael Crider said that &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1074935/nvidias-tone-deaf-pricing-is-a-golden-opportunity-for-amd-and-intel.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s tone-deaf RTX 40-series pricing is a golden opportunity for AMD and Intel</a>.&rdquo; With the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, at least, AMD is pressing the point. Here&rsquo;s to a new era of GPU competition after years of stagnation!</p>

It&rsquo;s huge and power hungry, but still cheaper and faster than the cheapest RTX 4080 models even with a worth-it $100 price premium over the reference XTX. Ray tracing enthusiasts will want to splurge for an Nvidia RTX 40-series card, however. </p>
</div>


<p>Can AMD&rsquo;s superb RDNA 3 graphics cards be improved upon? The $999 Radeon RX 7900 XTX hits the streets today, offering sublime performance that sprints past <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s $1,200 GeForce RTX 4080</a> and challenges the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">$1,600 RTX 4090</a> for hundreds of dollars less. It&rsquo;s a rip-roaring winner of a GPU, as our review of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review.html">AMD&rsquo;s Radeon RX 7900 XTX reference card</a> showed&mdash;but AMD&rsquo;s board design itself isn&rsquo;t flawless.</p>



<p>With Nvidia&rsquo;s rival RTX 40-series cards universally opting for gargantuan 3- to 4-slot coolers to tame their large &ldquo;Ada Lovelace&rdquo; GPUs, AMD took the opposite route, trotting out a clean, attractive 2.5-slot reference card that fits into virtually any PC. That&rsquo;s great for compatibility, but there&rsquo;s a trade off: Using a smaller cooler for the power-hungry XTX means the reference card has fine, but higher-than-usual temperatures and, more tangibly, you can definitely hear its fans, even though we wouldn&rsquo;t call it <em>loud</em>. Our model also suffered from coil whine, a complaint we saw from other reviewers as well.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="XFX Speedster Merc 310 vs AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX " class="wp-image-1433093" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC02041.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The XFX Speedster Merc 310 next to AMD&rsquo;s reference Radeon RX 7900 XTX.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>Enter custom boards like the $1,099 XFX Speedster Merc 310 7900 XTX we&rsquo;re reviewing today. The Merc 310 deploys XFX&rsquo;s usual big, badass, sleeky industrial design philosophy and it works to great effect, offering frigid temperatures and silent running. XFX also added a third 8-pin power connector and an optional secondary BIOS switch that pumps power from 327W to 339W, maxing out AMD&rsquo;s Powerplay recommendations to give overclocking enthusiasts plenty of room to work with.</p>



<p>If you can fit this chonky looker in your case, the XFX Speedster Merc 310&rsquo;s $100 premium delivers a much more pleasant overall experience than AMD&rsquo;s reference card while still blowing past the RTX 4080&rsquo;s performance for significantly less money. Let&rsquo;s dig in.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="xfx-merc-310-7900-xtx-specs-price-and-features">XFX Merc 310 7900 XTX specs, price, and features</h2>



<p>We dove deep into the baseline Radeon RX 7900 XTX specs in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review.html">our initial review</a>. Check that out if you want to get up to speed on the architectural changes AMD made for these debut RDNA 3 GPUs. Our focus here will be on the special sauce XFX added to the Speedster Merc 310. Here&rsquo;s its spec sheet:</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="XFX Speedster Merc 310 Radeon RX 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1433091" height="734" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/specs-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">XFX</p></div>



<p>The XFX Speedster Merc 310 7900 XTX comes factory overclocked out of the box, hitting a rated 2,455MHz Game Clock compared to the reference card&rsquo;s 2,300MHz. Flipping the helpful dual-BIOS switch to the right unlocks the optional max-power BIOS mentioned above, though XFX stresses that mode is <em>not </em>factory tested and will likely require manual tuning by enthusiasts for optimal results. If you&rsquo;re a tinkerer, that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll want to play around.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="XFX Speedster Merc 310 Radeon RX 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1433090" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC02033.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>We don&rsquo;t test overclocking prowess as part of our reviews, but we&rsquo;re told the XFX card can be coaxed close to 3GHz if you manage to win the Silicon Lottery. The Merc 310 uses a full digital 15+2 phase design along with those three 8-pin power connectors to pump as much clean power as possible into the GPU, helping clock speeds soar.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve been big fans of XFX&rsquo;s Speedster design in recent generations and that holds true here. The Speedster Merc 310 7900 XTX is a <em>big</em> graphics card&mdash;measuring 3 slots thick and a <em>loooooong</em> 13.5 inches&mdash;but XFX loaded every inch with additional cooling prowess, which results in the card running dead silent and ultra-cool under load.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="XFX Speedster Merc 310 Radeon RX 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1433092" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC02030.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="XFX Speedster Merc 310 Radeon RX 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1433087" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC02035.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>In addition to a massive full-length aluminum heatsink and three large fans with 13 blades apiece, XFX equipped the Merc 310 with a nickel-plated copper vapor chamber that cools both the GPU and the memory modules around it. XFX also took advantage of all the metal in the Merc, embedding no less than 20 different thermal pads throughout its interior to tame temperatures on the GPU, VRAM, power delivery system, and backside PCB components alike. The aluminum backplate offers 33 percent more surface area than XFX&rsquo;s 6950 XT Merc, and several thermal pads connect it to the rear of the PCB to help keep temps down. Eight 6mm copper heat pipes snake throughout the heatsink&rsquo;s fin stack to aid cooling endeavors even more. It&rsquo;s frightfully effective, as you&rsquo;ll see in our benchmarks section.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s also big and heavy with all that aluminum, nickel, and copper. Fortunately, XFX tosses a handy &ldquo;Z support bar&rdquo; into the box to combat against potential GPU sag concerns. It&rsquo;s optional, but I&rsquo;d use it in my own system. The Speedster Merc 310 7900 XTX is a beefy boi.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="XFX Speedster Merc 310 Radeon RX 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1433080" height="677" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/xfx-merc-310-7900-xtx-vapor-chamber-and-pads.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>A look at vapor chamber inside the XFX Speedster Merc 7900 XTX.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">XFX</p></div>



<p>I continue to love XFX&rsquo;s modern aesthetics, which remind me of a muscle car and futuristic industrialist vibes smashed together. You won&rsquo;t find RGB aboard this black-and-silver beauty, but the XFX logo glows a cool white when powered on. I like that XFX ditched the daring, but divisive &ldquo;Merc&rdquo; branding scrawled across the backplate in favor of a clean, unfettered look this time around. The Merc 310 also dumps the USB-C port found on AMD&rsquo;s reference card in favor of a third DisplayPort 2.1 connection.</p>



<p>All in all, the XFX Speedster Merc 310 7900 XTX is huge, but effective and attractive. Yes please. Now let&rsquo;s get to the benchmarks.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="our-test-system">Our test system</h2>



<p>We test graphics cards on an AMD Ryzen 5900X PC used exclusively for benchmarking GPUs. We now test with PCIe Resizable BAR (also known as Smart Access Memory on Ryzen systems) active, as most modern gaming PCs released in the last four years support the performance-boosting feature, either natively or via a motherboard firmware update. Nvidia also recommends turning on the optional &ldquo;Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling&rdquo; option in Windows to let the RTX 40-series stretch its legs to the fullest, so we&rsquo;ve made that tweak as well. Most of the hardware was provided by the manufacturers, but we purchased the storage ourselves.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re comparing XFX&rsquo;s $1,099 Speedster Merc 310 7900 XTX against AMD&rsquo;s own $999 7900 XTX and $899 7900 XT reference boards, of course, as well as Nvidia&rsquo;s available RTX 40-series offerings. We&rsquo;ve also included results from last generation&rsquo;s most ferocious GPUs as well.</p>

<p>We test a variety of games spanning various engines, genres, vendor sponsorships (Nvidia, AMD, and Intel), and graphics APIs (DirectX 9, 11, DX12, and Vulkan), to try to represent a full range of performance potential. Each game is tested using its in-game benchmark, sanity checked by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/frameview/&amp;xcust=2-1-1433026-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Nvidia&rsquo;s FrameView tool</a>, at the highest possible graphics presets unless otherwise noted, with VSync, frame rate caps, real-time ray tracing or DLSS effects, and FreeSync/G-Sync disabled, along with any other vendor-specific technologies like FidelityFX tools or Nvidia Reflex. We&rsquo;ve also enabled temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) to push these cards to their limits.</p>



<p>We run each benchmark at least three times and list the average result for each test. Outside of esports, we&rsquo;ve limited our benchmarks to 4K and 1440p resolutions, as those are the natural fits for these juggernaut GPUs, most of which cost four figures or more at launch. The XFX&rsquo;s factory overclock only provides a modest boost over the reference 7900 XT&rsquo;s performance, so we&rsquo;re going to preset these gaming benchmarks without commentary.

<h2 class="toc" id="power-and-thermals">Power and thermals</h2>



<p>We test power draw by looping the&nbsp;<em>F1 22</em>&nbsp;benchmark at 4K for about 20 minutes after we&rsquo;ve benchmarked everything else (to warm up the GPU) and noting the highest reading on our Watts Up Pro meter, which measures the power consumption of our entire test system. The initial part of the race, where all competing cars are onscreen simultaneously, tends to be the most demanding portion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This isn&rsquo;t a worst-case test; this is a GPU-bound game running at a GPU-bound resolution to gauge performance when the graphics card is sweating hard. If you&rsquo;re playing a game that also hammers the CPU, you could see higher overall system power draws. Consider yourself warned.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="XFX Speedster Merc 310 Radeon RX 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1433081" height="1199" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/power-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1183" width="1183" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>The Radeon RX 7900 XTX surprised us with its high power draw. Upping the wattage and cranking clock speeds makes the XFX Speedster Merc 310 suck down even more, putting it roughly on par with Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 4090. It&rsquo;s still well behind the insane power draw of last generation&rsquo;s custom RTX 3080 Ti GPUs, however.</p>



<p>We test thermals by leaving GPU-Z open during the&nbsp;<em>F1 22</em>&nbsp;power draw test, noting the highest maximum temperature at the end.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="XFX Speedster Merc 310 Radeon RX 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1433082" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/temps-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1184" width="1184" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p><em>Here </em>is where the Speedster Merc 310 truly shines. XFX full-metal juggernaut manages to stay a full <em>13 degrees cooler </em>than the AMD reference board, giving enthusiasts plenty of room to muck around with overclocking and other endeavors. Better yet, while our reference 7900 XTX model includes <em>definitely </em>audible (but not loud) fans and some surprisingly consistent coil whine, the XFX Merc 310 runs utterly silent. It&rsquo;s a massive quality of life upgrade over the reference board.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="should-you-buy-the-xfx-speedster-merc-310-7900-xtx">Should you buy the XFX Speedster Merc 310 7900 XTX?</h2>



<p>If you&rsquo;re shopping for a roughly $1,000 to $1,200 new-gen graphics card, but don&rsquo;t want to splurge $1,600 on the best-in-class GeForce RTX 4090, the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX delivers significantly more performance in many games than the $1,200 RTX 4080, while even going toe-to-toe with the 4090 at times. Ray tracing lags well behind the RTX 40-series, but you can still play ray traced games with similar levels of performance to the last-gen RTX 3090 flagship, so it&rsquo;s certainly no slouch.</p>



<p>For deeper buying advice breakdowns, check out the conclusion of our original <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review.html">Radeon RX 7900 XTX review</a>. In general, however, we consider the XTX to be a much better value than the RTX 4080 unless you place a heavy premium on ray tracing performance, DLSS 3 Frame Generation, and content creation workloads, which all favor Nvidia heavily. They&rsquo;re secondary to <em>just playing games</em>, however, and the XTX shines on that front.</p>



<p>The real question is whether you should buy XFX&rsquo;s custom board over AMD&rsquo;s reference model.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="XFX Speedster Merc 310 Radeon RX 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1433089" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC02028.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>For most people, the answer is yes. If you need the reference 7900 XTX&rsquo;s smaller size or USB-C port, it&rsquo;s likely to be one of the few offerings to include that combination. The reference board is likely also one of the few offerings to stick to AMD&rsquo;s $999 MSRP for the XTX if your budget is unyielding.</p>



<p>But if you can open your wallet further, XFX virtually perfects the 7900 XTX formula here. Spending an extra $100 gets you a graphics card that&rsquo;s well faster than the RTX 4080 and can sometimes rival (or even <em>beat</em>) the vaunted 4090 during standard gameplay, in a package that&rsquo;s attractive, ice cold, and utterly silent. XFX also threw in a max-power secondary BIOS and an extra power connector so overclocking enthusiasts have plenty of headroom to put all that cooling efficiency to work, though it lacks some specialized extra features (such as a fan control header and customizable RGB) you&rsquo;ll no doubt find in rival custom cards.</p>



<p>And, most striking of all, the price you&rsquo;re paying for this kick-ass custom XTX is <em>still at least $100 less</em> than the cheapest possible RTX 4080. That&rsquo;s rad. The XFX Speedster Merc 310 7900 XTX is face-meltingly fast, impressively cool, dead silent, <em>and </em>a (relative) value option. Most people shouldn&rsquo;t be shopping for four figure GPUs, but if you are, XFX&rsquo;s custom card easily earns an Editors&rsquo; Choice Award and comes highly recommended.</p>

<p>From zippy multimedia performance to punchy audio, the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 7 Carbon has a lot to offer at a reasonable price point. The real star of the show is the 14-inch 2880&times;1800 OLED display. According to the reviewer, &ldquo;the contrast is outstanding, with the deepest blacks and brightest whites.&rdquo; As for colors, they&rsquo;re &ldquo;accurate and noticeably vibrant.&rdquo; In addition to its stunning panel, the laptop also weighs just a little over 2 pounds, making it a capable travel laptop. There are a few minor shortcomings, though. The keyboard isn&rsquo;t the best and battery life is less than stellar. But in the end, the pros really outweigh the cons here.   </p>

<p>With its affordable price point, decent performance, and robust build, the Acer Aspire 5 is a good budget option for most people. While the color scheme is a little boring, the build is surprisingly rugged. Our tester was surprised by its &ldquo;solid, durable feel.&rdquo; The keyboard is nice, too. It has a spacious layout, which is perfect for longer typing sessions. Performance is fast enough for general-use tasks like writing emails and browsing the web, but that&rsquo;s about it. If you&rsquo;re shopping around for a solid everyday laptop that won&rsquo;t break the bank, the Aspire 5 is definitely worth a look.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a great convertible laptop, the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 will surely fit the bill. You can either prop it up like a tent or flip the screen around and use it like a tablet. We were also impressed with its vibrant display, all-day battery life, and diverse selection of ports. The design is a little utilitarian, but this is the kind of machine that favors function over aesthetics. The build is robust and there was hardly any flex in the keyboard tray. There are a couple of downsides like the loud fan noise and the lack of a physical privacy shutter on the webcam, but these issues are relatively minor. Overall, the Spin 713 is a solid convertible laptop that performs well. </p>

<p>Ah, folio-style laptops. While some may find them cumbersome to deal with, our reviewer really liked this one. The HP Chromebook x2 11 is one of the best 2-in-1 laptops you can buy. The tablet&rsquo;s aluminum chassis feels rugged and like it&rsquo;ll last quite a while. The detachable keyboard took some getting used to, but ended up being fine for long typing sessions. The rear plate, which transforms into a kickstand that holds up the tablet, connects to the back of the tablet via magnets. The reviewer found the connection to be both clean and strong. As for the performance, it&rsquo;s about what you&rsquo;d expect out of a Chromebook. It&rsquo;s zippy enough for everyday tasks like browsing the web and so on.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re serious about gaming, the Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition is one heck of a powerhouse. The review unit we tested had an 8-core AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX processor, an AMD Radeon RX 6800M GPU (with 12GB of GDDR6), 16GB of memory, and 512GB of NVMe SSD storage. You can play older titles on high to very-high graphics settings and newer games on medium. There are a few shortcomings, though. Battery life is lackluster and it&rsquo;s pretty darn heavy. That said, poor battery life and a clunky form factor isn&rsquo;t unusual for a gaming laptop, and if you&rsquo;re looking to play some games when you aren&rsquo;t busy working on assignments, this powerhouse offers much more value than most of its rivals. Looking for something a little more robust to fulfill your gaming needs?

<p>When it comes to&nbsp;gaming laptops, many if not most of them are pretty bulky and heavy, often tipping the scales at five or six pounds. Well, that&rsquo;s not the case with the XPG Xenia 15 KC. It weighs a little over four pounds, which is fairly lightweight for a gaming laptop. Plus, it runs very quiet. According to our review, it &ldquo;rarely makes noise under normal use.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s impressive, as most gaming laptops tend to sound like a rocket blasting off. If you&rsquo;re looking for something that&rsquo;s both quiet and portable, the Xenia 15 KC is an excellent choice.</p>

<p>From stellar performance to the lightweight form factor, the Acer Swift X has a lot to offer. In addition to handling content-creation tasks, it can also run a few lightweight games as well. However, its biggest strength is its battery life. Despite the power-hungry internals, the Swift X&rsquo;s battery lasted more than 12 hours in our tests. Depending on your use, you won&rsquo;t need to go hunting for an outlet all that much. It&rsquo;s perfect for college students.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 5G offers a gorgeous OLED screen, superb battery life, and an excellent inking experience. It also has a 360-degree hinge, which means you can fold it into a tent or swing the display around and use it like a tablet. It&rsquo;s very versatile, which may appeal to students or business professionals. In our review, our tester described it as &ldquo;an excellent coffee shop PC.&rdquo; The only drawback is the slow SSD. That said, those issues have been common with Windows 11.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a college student working with a modest budget, the Acer Swift 3 is a fantastic option. It features an attractive 16-inch 1080p display, a solid chassis, and an enjoyable keyboard and touchpad. However, battery life is subpar, so you&rsquo;ll want to keep the charger on hand. This is rather unfortunate, as the Swift 3&rsquo;s slim profile makes it a capable laptop for travel. If you don&rsquo;t mind the lackluster battery life, this is a great laptop for watching movies and streaming video on.</p>

<p>Why have one display when you could have two? The Asus Zenbook Pro 14 takes the regular laptop display and doubles it. It comes with a 14.5-inch 4K touch OLED main panel and a unique secondary 12.7-inch 2880&times;864 screen located above the keyboard. Since the second display is recognized by Windows as a second monitor you can use it to help boost productivity, such as using it as another trackpad or to display touch controls for apps. With a Core i7 processor, RTX 3050 graphics, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 1TB NVMe SSD the Zenbook Pro 14 also comes with some solid hardware. All of these great features put quite a strain on the battery though so it doesn&rsquo;t have the best battery life. However, the Zenbook Pro 14 Duo OLED is basically a mid-range workstation complete with two high quality displays and enough punch to support you through all of your educational and personal tasks.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>



<p>The PCWorld team puts each and every Windows laptop through a series of benchmarks that test GPU and CPU performance, battery life, and so on. The idea is to push the laptop to its limits and then compare it against others we&rsquo;ve tested. Chromebooks, on the other hand, go through a series of web-based tests. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair or possible to run the same kinds of tests on a Chromebook, as they&rsquo;re Chrome OS-based machines. Below, you&rsquo;ll find a breakdown of each test and the reasons why we run them.</p>



<h3 id="windows-laptops">Windows laptops</h3>



<ul><li><strong>PCMark 10</strong>: PCMark 10 is how we determine how well the laptop handles lighter tasks like web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, and so on.</li><li><strong>HandBrake</strong>: HandBrake is more intensive than PCMark 10. It basically measures how long a laptop&rsquo;s CPU takes to encode a beefy 30GB file. </li><li><strong>Cinebench</strong>: Cinebench is a brief stress test of the CPU cores. It does this by rendering a 2D scene over a short period of time.</li><li><strong>3DMark</strong>: 3DMark checks if 3D performance remains consistent over time by running graphic-intensive clips. </li><li><strong>Video rundown test</strong>: To gauge battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 10&rsquo;s Movies &amp; TV app until the laptop dies.</li></ul>



<h3 id="chromebooks">Chromebooks</h3>



<ul><li><strong>CrXPRT 2</strong>: The CrXPRT 2 benchmark tests a Chromebook&rsquo;s battery life. </li><li><strong>Speedometer 2.0</strong>: This test determines a Chromebook&rsquo;s web browser performance. It simulates this by adding, completing, and removing a to-do list.</li><li><strong>Basemark Web 3.0</strong>: This benchmark gauges how well a Chromebook can handle web-based applications. </li><li><strong>Kraken 1.1</strong>: Kraken 1.1 is a JavaScript performance benchmark. </li><li><strong>Jetstream 2</strong>: Jetstream 2 is a combination of WebAssembly and JavaScript benchmarks. This is a way to gauge how well a Chromebook runs advanced workloads.</li></ul>



<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-laptop-for-college">What to look for in a laptop for college</h2>



<p>The first thing to consider is budget. How much are you willing to spend on a laptop? If you&rsquo;re working with an inflexible budget, Chromebooks are a good option. They&rsquo;re affordable and designed to handle everyday tasks like writing papers, working on spreadsheets, and so on. Chromebook prices can range anywhere from $200 up to $1,000. If you want to spend a bit more, laptops with convertible touchscreens (otherwise known as 2-in-1s) offer a great deal of functionality. You can flip the screen around and use it like a tablet or prop it up like an easel for watching movies.  </p>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a jam-packed schedule, you&rsquo;ll probably be running from class to class with very little downtime in between. That&rsquo;s why we recommend a laptop with a long-lasting battery. We recommend something that&rsquo;ll last 7 to 10-plus hours on a single charge, unless you want a notebook that can play games on the side&mdash;gaming laptops are notorious for their shorter endurance, even during everyday tasks. That 7 to 10 hours is a good figure if you plan on taking your laptop with you everywhere.</p>



<p>Things like navigating your e-mail or watching Netflix will require more RAM. We recommend springing for 8GB of RAM or more. 4GB of RAM is fine and good for web browsing and basic office work, but 8GB is better for having more tabs open and whatnot. Plus, applications like Google Chrome and Spotify tend to eat up a lot of RAM. Most people can get by with 4GB in a pinch if you&rsquo;re on a tight budget, but you won&rsquo;t be able to multitask as much.</p>



<p>The final thing is a decent keyboard. In college, you&rsquo;re going to be spending <em>a lot</em> of time typing. Depending on your personal preference, you may want either a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/557179/full-travel-keyboard-vs-low-travel-whats-the-difference.html">full or short travel keyboard</a>. Mechanical keyboards, for example, normally have longer travel. This helps prevent accidental keystrokes. The keys also give a lot of tactile feedback, as they bounce back after they&rsquo;re pressed down. </p>



<p>For more specifics regarding the hardware you want inside your laptop, be sure to check out our comprehensive guide on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/549407/how-to-buy-a-budget-laptop-without-getting-screwed.html">how to buy a budget laptop without getting screwed</a>, as well as our broader cheatsheet on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/551001/buying-a-laptop-look-for-pcs-with-these-cpus-and-gpus.html">what to look for in a laptop CPU and GPU</a>.</p>

<h3 id="can-you-use-your-chromebook-for-gaming">Can you use your Chromebook for gaming?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Simply put, no&mdash;at least, not well. It comes down to what type of gaming you intend to do. Chromebooks can run web games and Android games perfectly well. But if you&rsquo;re looking to play the latest high-powered titles such as <em>Elden Ring</em>, a Chromebook just won&rsquo;t cut it. This is mainly due to the fact that most titles only run on Windows and Chromebooks typically don&rsquo;t come with sufficient graphics power.</p>



<p>All that said, Google is trying to bring cloud gaming to its Chromebooks. Cloud gaming services work by using a remote PC or console to play games streamed through the cloud down onto the Chromebook. However, until this service becomes more common, Chromebooks are not good options for gaming.</p>

<h3 id="can-you-game-with-integrated-graphics">Can you game with integrated graphics?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes, recently the the latest integrated graphics processors from the likes of Intel and AMD can handle modern PC games at reasonable settings. For example, Intel&rsquo;s latest Iris Xe line of processors with integrated graphics have been shown to run some of the latest releases at 1080p and 30fps. Be careful, however, as not all integrated graphics are created equal.</p>



<p>Regarding gaming performance, Intel and AMD&rsquo;s integrated graphics have made huge leaps in recent years. So if you&rsquo;re on a budget or looking for an ultra-thin laptop and the only options include integrated graphics, fear not, you can still game on.

<h3 id="what-laptop-size-is-best">What laptop size is best?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>This is mostly personal preference. Students who bring their laptops to class or intend to travel a lot should consider a smaller, more portable size. Anything in the neighborhood of 13 to 14 inches is recommended. However, if you want to use your laptop for gaming, then you should consider something in the 15- to 17-inch range. It&rsquo;s also important to keep in mind the weight of the laptop before buying it. Ultra thin laptops can weigh a featherlight 2 pounds while hefty gaming rigs top the scales at three or four times that&mdash;not exactly something you want to carry in a backpack everyday.</p>
