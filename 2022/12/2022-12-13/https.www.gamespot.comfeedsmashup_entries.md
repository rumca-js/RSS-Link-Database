<p>While Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson are beefing over who has the bigger ego, other Fast Saga cast members are making friends, and now John Cena and Jason Momoa are set to star in an action-comedy called Killer Vacation from Warner Bros., <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/12/john-cena-jason-momoa-to-star-in-action-comedy-killer-vacation-1235198231/">Deadline</a> reports.</p><p>Momoa and Cena met on the set of Fast 9 and Fast X according to <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/john-cena-jason-momoa-movie-killer-vacation-1235459580/">Variety</a>, and they must've hit it off, because they're going to be spending a lot more time together. The details of the film are under wraps, but sources have compared the film to blockbuster action movies like True Lies. The script comes from Mark and Brian Gunn, James Gunn's cousin and brother respectively. Peter Safran and John Rickard will produce the film. The deal for this film was reportedly set before Safran and James Gunn took the DC Studios throne at Warner Bros.</p><p>Momoa and Cena have not previously appeared on-screen together unless you count Momoa's uncredited cameo in Cena's Peacemaker series. Both actors are active in the current iteration of Warner Bros.' DC universe. Momoa has appeared in a few films as Aquaman, while Cena played Peacemaker first in James Gunn's The Suicide Squad, followed by the ten-episode Peacemaker series.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-cena-and-jason-momoa-join-forces-for-action-comedy-film-killer-vacation/1100-6510015/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Avatar: The Way Of Water Looks To Make $175 Million Opening Weekend

<p>Early tracking estimates for Avatar: The Way of Water show the sequel starting off with a bang. Current projections point to director James Cameron's latest flick to open with between $150 million to $175 million--a notable difference domestically against the original that made $77 million initially.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/box-office/avatar-way-of-water-box-office-opening-weekend-projections-1235459227/">Variety</a>, the site behind these numbers, added that Avatar: The Way of Water has already sold $38 million in advance ticket sales. That puts the sequel in front of Top Gun: Maverick and Jurassic World: Dominion but trailing Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness as well as Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Those Marvel Cinematic Universe movies saw $181 million and $180 million, respectively, in their opening weekends.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking past this weekend, Avatar: The Way of Water won't have much competition in the blockbuster space in the coming months. Babylon, starring Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie, and the horror film M3GAN appear to be the strongest challengers for the next month. What might hurt the Avatar sequel, though, is a running time of three hours and 12 minutes.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-the-way-of-water-looks-to-make-175-million-opening-weekend/1100-6510013/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) is the latest addition to the John Wick spinoff, Ballerina. <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/12/walking-dead-norman-reedus-ballerina-john-wick-spinoff-1235198189/">Deadline</a> was first to report.</p><p dir="ltr">Reedus joins a cast that includes Ana de Armas, Anjelica Huston, Ian McShane, Lance Reddick, and Catalina Sandino Moreno. Keanu Reeves will reportedly be making a cameo. In Ballerina, de Armas stars as a young assassin seeking revenge against those who killed her family. John Wick: Parabellum writer Shay Hatten wrote the script. John Wick series veteran Chad Stahelski is producing.</p><p dir="ltr">Ballerina, like the John Wick series it's part of, will be full of action. Stahelski told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/chad-stahelski-john-wick-4-his-matrix-4-involvement-1296473/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, "We're not just copying ourselves over and over again with gun-fu or something like that." And because the character Ballerina is not a copy of Keanu Reeves' John Wick, viewers are "going to get a different take on things," Stahelski said. His acclaimed 87eleven stunt team that worked on the John Wick movies is also working on Ballerina for its action sequences.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/norman-reedus-joins-john-wick-spinoff-ballerina/1100-6510012/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Next-Gen Update - Cross-Saves And Cross-Progression Explained

<p>From December 14, any player that owns <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> will be treated with a free, next-generation update. This update gives players access to improved graphics as well new quests, cosmetics, and more, all for free if you already own the game. Those who do not own the game will be able to buy The Witcher 3: Complete Edition, which includes the next-gen update as well as both of the game's narrative expansions, Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine. In addition to all of that content, developer CD Projekt RED has also implemented a new online feature in The Witcher 3. This feature gives players access to <strong>cross-progression and cross-saves</strong>. Essentially, this means that players will be able to access their Witcher 3 saves on different platforms from the one they initially played on. Below, you can see exactly how to take advantage of the new cross-save system in The Witcher 3.</p><h2>Cross-saves in The Witcher 3</h2><p>CD Projekt RED has essentially ported over the cross-save system from Cyberpunk 2077 to The Witcher 3. Players can store their auto-saves, most recent manual save, and quicksaves in the cloud, which can then be accessed on different platforms. The caveat is that players can only have one cross-save active on any platform, so you couldn't transport different saves with plans to save-scrub across platforms. Of course, this new feature also only applies to the current-gen consoles, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, and PC, as those are the platforms that are receiving the next-gen update.</p><p>In order to use the cross-save functionality in The Witcher 3, you will need to simply enable the "cross-progression" option within the settings of the game. To do this, pause The Witcher 3 and then open the "save" or "load" menu. From here, you will be able to enable cross-progression, which will then require you to log into your <a href="https://www.gog.com/?pp=6d7084b4994a00d15257677cab1bc26390d1a432">GoG account</a>, which is CDPR's digital video game marketplace.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-next-gen-update-cross-saves-and-cross-progression-explained/1100-6509998/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

During the event players can enjoy Mei's Snowball Offensive, Mei's Yeti Hunt, and Freezethaw Elimination.

Also during the event, there are challenges tied to these game modes, with players unlocking the new Ice Queen Brigitte skin for completing enough of the challenges. There is Mei's Snowball Offensive, where players all battle as Mei, shooting one-shot snowballs at each other in this elimination mode. There is the 5v5 version as well as the Snowball Deathmatch eight-player FFA.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also the Yeti Hunter mode, where five players, all playing as Mei, must work together to trap and freeze a Winston who is trying to steal food. If Winston eats enough food, his ultimate activates and he can go berserk on the Mei menagerie. Lastly is the 4v4 Freezethaw Elimination mode, where two teams fight to eliminate each other. The catch is that whenever someone is eliminated, they are frozen in-place and can be thawed out by a teammate. Each round the winning team is locked out of the heroes they used, forcing them to adapt each round.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-winter-wonderland-2022-overview-all-skins-twitch-drops-and-arcade-modes/1100-6510010/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Winter Wonderland Returns In Overwatch 2 With Special Winter Modes And Festive Goodies

<p>Starting today and ending January 4, players can participate in special holiday and winter-themed modes in Overwatch 2 as well as pick up some limited-time goodies.</p><p>Multiple arcade modes are available exclusively during this period. The first is Mei's Snowball Offensive. In this mode, Mei fires snowballs that instantly KO enemy players. Every player plays as Mei in 6v6 elimination or eight-player free-for-all rulesets. The next is Mei's Yeti Hunt, a 5v1 raid-style mode. Five players, as Mei, attempt to prevent a player-controlled Yeti from stealing food from a nearby village. If the Yeti steals too much meat, he will enter an ultra-powerful frenzy, making it very difficult for the remaining Meis to defeat him. The final mode is Freezethaw Elimination. In this mode, players eliminate enemies by freezing them and attempt to thaw their own teammates to stay in the game. Whichever team freezes the entirety of the other wins.</p><p>If players log in to Overwatch 2 from December 20 to January 4, they can pick up a wreath weapon charm and the 2023 Celebration Hat player icon. Players can also pick some some D.Va goodies via Twitch drops. Watch drops-enabled streams for two hours to earn the Festive D.Va Victory Pose. Watch for four hours to earn the Sleighing D.Va Legendary Skin. As in past years, other winter cosmetics will be available during the event.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/winter-wonderland-returns-in-overwatch-2-with-special-winter-modes-and-festive-goodies/1100-6510009/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The endgame for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft's</a> new Dragonflight expansion has arrived, with a plethora of new content for players to sink their teeth into as they continue their journey in the Dragon Isles.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 1 kicks off with the introduction of the new Vault of the Incarnates raid, where players will seek to prevent the expansion's current big-bad Raszageth from releasing her fellow evil-doers from their ancient magical prison. There's a good chance she will succeed in her task and push the story forward, but players will have to wait and see what the raid's ending cutscene reveals.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Assault the Vault!<br />Season One of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dragonflight?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#Dragonflight</a> is rolling out across the Dragon Isles. <a href="https://t.co/bXZPc0b0U8">pic.twitter.com/bXZPc0b0U8</a></p>  — World of Warcraft (@Warcraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1602742830233161729?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">December 13, 2022</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">For those who aren't keen on raiding, today also marks the start of Dragonflight's first Mythic+ season, where players can tackle progressively more challenging dungeons enhanced by various modifiers in order to score better and better loot. The new Thundering affix will start things off, which increases enemy health by 5% while periodically charging players with a deadly electrical charge that will need to be discharged in order to avoid some electrifying consequences.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-season-1-introduces-new-raid-pvp-season-world-events-and-more/1100-6510006/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Then again, there are also shows that just aren't very good or managed to escape being noticed at all because of the crowded streaming landscape.</p><p dir="ltr">Whatever the case, 2022 is no different. Already, we've seen so many shows get the ax, pointing to what will likely be a very busy year on the cutting room floor. After all, there are more streaming services than ever, and they're all trying their hand at original programming. So even some of the most hyped shows aren't making it beyond their initial seasons. Who can forget that both Cowboy Bebop and Y: The Last Man were canceled fairly quickly after their respective premieres?</p><p>Are your favorite shows safe? What's been canceled so far? And, honestly, is any TV show safe? Those are the questions we're trying to answer. Take a look below at every single TV show that's been canceled so far in 2022. And while we're at it, make sure to check out the surprising number of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/a-look-at-every-tv-show-canceled-in-2021/2900-3701/">shows that got canned in 2021</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1.

<p dir="ltr">Fans have had to wait nearly 13 years for the three-hour Avatar: The Way of Water to finally hit theaters--but one of the wilder numbers associated with the epic sequel is that star Kate Winslet famously spent a record-making seven minutes and 15 seconds underwater in its filming. Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/kate-winslet-interview-avatar-way-of-water/">Total Film</a>, Winslet shared her reaction to inadvertently setting a record in the course of production.</p><p dir="ltr">"I have the video of me surfacing saying, 'Am I dead, have I died?' And then going, 'What was [my time]?'" Winslet said. "Straight away I wanted to know my time. And I couldn't believe it… The next thing I say is, 'We need to radio set.' I wanted Jim to know right away."</p><p dir="ltr">Winslet elaborated that she "didn't have to" hold her breath for that amount of time, but "the opportunity to set a record presented itself. I wanted to break my own record, which was already six minutes and 14 seconds." Writer-director James Cameron added that Winslet "is not competitive at all."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kate-winslet-recorded-her-reaction-to-holding-her-breath-for-7-minutes-for-avatar-2/1100-6510004/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4076584-dek.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-trailer-reveals-plenty-of-new-spideys/1100-6509977/">trailer for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse has arrived</a>, and there are a lot of different Spider-characters in the trailer. In fact, there are almost too many to count. But what are the best or coolest-looking Spider-folk in the trailer?</p><p>The second animated Spider-Man film is a bit off from release, hitting theaters on June 2, 2023. It will feature multiple directors: Joaquim Dos Santos (Voltron: Legendary Defender), Kemp Powers (Soul), and Justin K. Thompson (Spider-Man: Intro the Spider-Verse). Shang-Chi and Mortal Kombat writer Dave Callaham joins Spider-Verse writers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller for the sequel, which will see Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, and Jake Johnson reprise their roles as the Spider-powered heroes. New to the film is Oscar Isaac, Issa Rae, Daniel Kaluuya, Jason Schwartzman, and Jorma Taccone.</p><p>The movie takes place between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-has-240-characters-across-6-universes-sequel-gets-new-title/1100-6502799/">six universes and will feature 240 characters</a>--and every universe will have its own distinct feel. And from the looks of the new trailer, we see dozens of these characters. Some of these characters have origins from the worlds of comic books, TV shows, and movies, and some seem to be made up for just the movie.</p><p>Going through the trailer, we found 16 Spider-people that we loved and decided to rank them all for you, starting with number 16 below. Who is your favorite Spider-person from the trailer? Let us know.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>16. Spider-Armor</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4076395-15.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The black and gray Spider-Man in this pile is Spider-Armor MK I. Peter Parker created this armor to fight the New Enforcers, a group of baddies with high-powered weapons. It's a very '90s outfit. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>15. Kaine Parker</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4076396-16.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The second Scarlet Spider was an attempted clone of Peter Parker by the villain Jackal. The eyes look different on the red and black costume all the way on the left, but it looks like the same character.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>14. Dad Bod Spider-Man</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4076400-dadbodspiderman.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>As we get older, it gets harder and harder to keep the pounds off. The Spider-Man on the left also seems to have that problem. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>13. Mangaverse Spider-Man</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4076398-anime.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>This version of Spider-Man comes from a 2002 mini-series titled Marvel Mangaverse: Spider-Man. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>12. Spider-Armor MK II</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4076405-spidermanblackandgold.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Better known as the Black and Gold suit, the MKII Armor came from Horizon Labs, and Spider-Man needed it to fight a villain named Massacre. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. Bagman</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4076399-bagman.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>This technically isn't the Bagman we know and love--as that one had a bag on his head and was wearing a Fantastic Four outfit--but this is a nice reference to that character.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. Spider-Security</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4076404-securityguardspiderman.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>At one point, we see a Spider-Man directing traffic, and he's in a security outfit. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Spider-Jock</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4076401-flash.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>At first, we thought this was a Flash Thompson/Spider-Man crossover, but Flash has appeared as Spider-Man before--wearing the costume but having none of the powers. Maybe this is a universe where high school football star Flash Thompson got bitten by the radioactive spider.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Maybelle Reilly</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4076402-maybellereilly.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Also known as Lady Spider, this character appeared in the Marvel event Spider-Verse. She's got a very cool, almost steampunk-like design. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Werewolf Spider-Man</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4076408-werewolfspiderman.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Marvel sure does like werewolves, and we get to see one in this Spider-Man trailer. There have been a few times Marvel heroes have become werewolves. There is a whole universe in Marvel Comics dedicated to werewolves, and we saw Spider-Wolf in 2007's Marvel Zombies/Army of Darkness comic.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Spider-Man (The Video Game)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4076406-spidermangame.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Briefly, we see two Spider-Men walking, and one of those heroes is wearing the costume from Spider-Man video game from Insomniac. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Spider-Woman</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4076394-13.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Spider-Woman makes her way to the big screen, and yes, her motorcycle is coming along for the ride. We see her briefly, fighting The Vulture--who is voiced by Jorma Taccone. This design for Jessica Drew looks great.</p><p>Jessica is voiced by Issa Rae. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Spider-Man 2099</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4076397-18.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>In the post-credit sequence of the first movie, we got our first look at Miguel O'Hara, Spider-Man 2099. In the comics, he's Spider-Man in the year 2099. It seems like he could be an antagonist in this movie--alongside The Spot.</p><p>Miguel is voiced by Oscar Isaac</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Spider-Gwen</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4076393-3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>This isn't the Gwen Stacy that died at the hands of Green Goblin--obviously. She's a Spider-hero in her own right and a badass musician. </p><p>Gwen is voiced by Hailee Steinfeld.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Spider-Man from Earth-616</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4076392-2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Miles' mentor in the first Spider-Verse movie, this Peter Parker has been a bit down on his luck and looking for redemption. </p><p>Peter is voiced by Jake Johnson.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Mile Morales</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4076391-1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Of course, the best Spider-Man in the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is none other than Miles Morales, the Spider-Man of Earth-1610. He's still trying to figure out how to be a hero, understand his powers--which differ from others like him--and he's one of the more compelling superheroes.</p><p>Miles is voiced by Shameik Moore.</p><p>You can see more of Miles Morales when Across the Spider-Verse hits theaters on June 2, 2023.</p></h3></p><br />

<p dir="ltr">It's been more than a dozen years since James Cameron has brought Avatar to the big screen, so both excitement and skepticism are understandably high as Avatar: The Way of Water is just a few days away from hitting theaters. As recently as September, Cameron was saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-avatar-2-be-a-success-13-years-after-the-first-i-guess-were-going-to-find-out-director-says/1100-6507638/">he has no idea</a> whether the film will be a success--though the first teaser trailer racking up 150 million views in its first day bodes well.</p><p dir="ltr">Avatar: The Way of Water is directed by Cameron, and co-written by him with Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver. The film's cast includes Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, and Kate Winslet.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">As of this writing, the three-hour Avatar 2 has an aggregate score of 72 on GameSpot sister site Metacritic, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/avatar-the-way-of-water">based on 42 critic reviews</a>. Over on Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a higher 83% <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avatar_the_way_of_water">based on 80 reviews</a>.

Three versions are up for grab, along with a few preorder bonuses that make it worth reserving a copy of the game today if you know you’ll be playing it at launch. There’s also an elusive (not to mention expensive) collector’s edition available on the Square Enix Store--although the initial batch of preorders sold out quickly after going live, so you’ll need to pay close attention if you want to snag a copy in the future. Here’s a closer look at where to preorder Final Fantasy XVI along with everything offered with each edition.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Final Fantasy XVI Preorder Bonuses</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4076318-ff16preorderbonuses.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Preorder bonuses are a bit confusing for Final Fantasy XVI. Three different in-game items are available, but whether you get them depends both on where you preorder the game and which version you opt for. Just about every retailer is offering the Cat Sith Charm (which boosts the rate at which you gain Gil) along with the Braveheart weapon, but the Scholar’s Spectacles item (which boosts XP gain) is only available with the following editions:</p><ul><li>Collector’s Edition</li><li>Deluxe Edition (Digital)</li><li>Standard Edition (Digital)</li></ul><p>In other words, you’ll want to pay close attention to the fine print when preordering FFXVI to ensure you’re getting the best bonuses at your preferred retailer.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Preorder Final Fantasy XVI Standard Edition</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4076319-ff16standardedition.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>$70</strong></p><p>Looking for the cheapest way to pick up Final Fantasy XVI?

## Avatar: The Way Of Water Review – Dead In The Water

<p>You know that brief, horrible moment when you're visiting an older relative's house, and you sit down in front of the TV and realize that they have yet to disable motion smoothing? Even if you've never heard the term before, there's a good chance you're familiar with the look of it--suddenly your favorite show looks like it's a soap opera or shot as a home movie and all the actors look just this side of uncanny--not enough to look totally inhuman but enough that it's distracting. Avatar: The Way Of Water dares to ask the question that was on absolutely no one's mind: What if you got stuck in that uncanny motion smoothing nightmare zone for over three hours and could not turn it off? In fact, what if all those too-smooth, almost-but-not-quite unreal looking actors were rendered in 3D and a couple dozen feet tall?</p><p dir="ltr">To be fair, not all of Avatar 2 looks like it's buffered with artificial frames for that motion smoothing effect. The uncanniness sticks solely to the human cast members, who don't make up the bulk of the movie by any shot--but when they do come around (and they're around for a large chunk of the too-long first act), it's hard to be anything but distracted by just how odd it all looks. And, for a movie franchise that owes the whole of its notoriety to the fact that it lives on the absolute bleeding edge of technology, this is a rough way to kick things off.</p><p dir="ltr">And things, regrettably, stay pretty rough. Even once the human actors' uncanniness dissipates (it never fully goes away, but it does become less pronounced the fewer live-action scenes there are) the bizarrely uneven visual effects start to become more and more prominent. Make no mistake: huge chunks of this movie are absolutely gorgeous. Just about all of the water and underwater effects are rendered immaculately, and there is some genuinely incredible animation at work to capture little micro expressions in the acting which make the Na'vi characters look and feel very real. These moments are just chopped up between other considerably longer and more obtrusive ones that look and feel like they've been torn out of the cut-scene of a PS5 game. Sure, PS5 cut-scenes do look very good, but they really don't hold up to the sort of scrutiny they need to withstand when they're both in IMAX and in 3D.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/avatar-the-way-of-water-review-dead-in-the-water/1900-6418013/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

If you want to keep things as violent as ever, though, you'll want to get your hands on the unvaulted Snowball Launcher, which will be around for a limited time to help you celebrate the holidays with some explosive fun. We'll tell you where you can get your hands on this fun weapon and how it works below.</p><h2>Where to get the Snowball Launcher and how it works</h2><p>The Snowball Launcher can be found on the ground, in chests, and from the small presents that you can find spawned across the map, which you can then throw on the ground to spawn a giant present full of loot. It holds six snowballs at a time and uses comes in Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary variants, with each offering a minor damage boost over the previous level.</p><p>This weapon functions like your typical grenade launcher except for the fact that the grenades are, well, snowballs. This makes it an excellent choice for wreaking some havoc--especially from above--by lobbing the snowballs at opponents trying to hide behind cover. Note, however, that the snowballs don't really bounce around or take long to detonate, meaning you'll want to make sure you're aiming them pretty much exactly where you'd like for them to land. Thankfully, landing just a few shots on an enemy should be enough to drop them, so once you learn how to aim it properly, you'll be knocking folks quite easily, you grinch.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-unvaulted-where-to-get-the-snowball-launcher-and-how-it-works/1100-6509968/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Elden Ring Is GameSpot's Game Of The Year 2022

<p dir="ltr">In the last decade, few developers have been as influential as From Software. Whether it's the challenging gameplay of Demon's Souls, the thoughtfully constructed worlds of Dark Souls, the compelling stories of Bloodborne, or the razor-sharp gameplay of Sekiro, each of its games has resonated in profound ways.</p><p dir="ltr">The design of From Software's games is expertly calculated and balanced; that much comes through in the sense of discovery you feel as you inch through decrepit castles, unsettling forests, and otherworldly realms of darkness. It's in that triumphant swing of a sword that brings a seemingly insurmountable enemy to its knees, and the heartbreaking moment where a misstep allows a foe to bring you to yours.</p><p dir="ltr">The soaring highs and crushing lows of From Software's gameplay loops hinge on the foresight to know what a player will see, when they will see it, and how they're likely to react. On paper, an open world that affords the freedom to go anywhere and do anything would surely undermine the design principles that From Software has diligently refined to the precipice of perfection. And yet, Elden Ring showed that the opposite was in fact the case.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2022/1100-6509957/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>As 2022 comes to an end, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a> is preparing to wind down the year with its traditional Dawning event. This year's festive celebrations will take place from December 13 until January 3, and like previous Dawning events, there'll be gifts to hand out, new gear to collect, and iceballs enhanced by the dark powers of a primordial entity to hurl at enemies.</p><div>          </div><p>Like the most recent instances of Solstice and Festival of the Lost, The Dawning will have its own Event Card that will contain numerous challenges to pursue.

## Scientists Confirm Nuclear Fusion Breakthrough That Could Be "Transformative" For Humanity

<p>The United States' Department of Energy announced what it called a "major scientific breakthrough" involving a successful attempt to create nuclear fusion that some believe could be "transformative" for humanity. If this all sounds familiar, it's because nuclear fusion of this type was a plot point of 2004's Spider-Man 2, but here's to hoping things go better in real life.</p><p>In an announcement streamed live (watch it below), Department of Energy secretary Jennifer Granholm confirmed that researchers from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California created what is called "net energy gain" for the first time recently. This is the term for when the fusion reactor produced more energy than was used to ignite it, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-business-california-climate-and-environment-d6cb7b048ce916e04be809482fd9cbe6?taid=639897d34399fc0001284c81&amp;utm_campaign=TrueAnthem&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_source=Twitter">according to the Associated Press</a>. This is a major breakthrough in efforts to creating clean power and other scientific advancements, though no one's home will run on energy produced by fusion anytime soon.</p><p>The appeal of nuclear fusion as an energy source is that it can create carbon-free energy on a nearly limitless basis, helping move away from fossil fuel sources that can be bad for the environment and costly. It also doesn't create radioactive waste like traditional nuclear reactions do.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/scientists-confirm-nuclear-fusion-breakthrough-that-could-be-transformative-for-humanity/1100-6509984/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Why Some Experts Believe That Microsoft-Activision Blizzard Merger Won't Happen

<p dir="ltr">Microsoft's proposed purchase of Activision Blizzard is the biggest proposed deal in video game history, but some notable outlets are wondering if it's going to happen at all. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-ftc-is-now-suing-microsoft-over-pending-activision-blizzard-merger/1100-6509849/">Federal Trade Commission suit</a> against the acquisition has turned into a major hurdle that the company must clear.</p><p dir="ltr">Business publication <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4563906-microsoft-should-just-walk-away-from-the-activision-deal">Seeking Alpha</a> recently ran an analysis piece that suggested that Microsoft should walk away from the proposed merger, citing legal challenges and an uncertain economic outlook as key factors. Author JR Research also questioned Microsoft's plan to compete with Google and Apple on the platform front with a proposed "super app." The author notes that the next few years in gaming are expected to be slow in terms of growth due to the pandemic's impact on the industry.</p><p dir="ltr">The FTC's case against the deal is not at all straightforward, and its legal fate remains up in the air. As a Columbia Law School professor told the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftcs-move-to-block-microsofts-deal-for-activision-blizzard-came-despite-charm-offensive-11670628909?mod=hp_lead_pos2">Wall Street Journal</a>, the FTC has a high burden to clear in order to prove that the deal is "anti-competitive," especially since Activision Blizzard and Microsoft theoretically represent two different phases of the video game production model. This makes the deal a "vertical merger," which US courts have typically greenlit.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-some-experts-believe-that-microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-wont-happen/1100-6509987/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Avatar: The Way of Water hasn't officially opened up to wide audiences yet, but that's not stopping director James Cameron and producer Jon Landau from teasing the fifth--yes, fifth!-- entry in the franchise. The focus of the films so far is on Pandora and its rare resource unobtainium. But the spotlight could shift to Earth eventually.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/avatar-5-plot-james-cameron-pandora-earth-jon-landau-1849854542">Gizmodo</a>, Landau explained what we could see if Avatar 5 gets made. "Well, it's funny. I wasn’t going to talk about it, but I've now subsequently heard that Jim [Cameron] has talked about it a little bit," Landau said. "In movie five there is a section of the story where we go to Earth. And we go to it to open people's eyes, open Neytiri's eyes, to what exists on Earth."</p><p dir="ltr">Changing the setting is apparently related to Neytiri's character arc, according to Landau.

"And we want to expose Neytiri to that."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-5-will-go-to-earth-if-it-gets-made/1100-6509982/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Fire Emblem Engage Feels Like A Leaner Tactical JRPG

<p>There are two types of Fire Emblem players: Those who gravitate towards the social mechanics and those who prefer the tactical turn-based combat. After a guided demo, Fire Emblem Engage seems like it may cater more towards the latter. While the social sim aspects are still intact, there seem to be far fewer extraneous activities in the hub area compared to Three Houses. A lot of your time at the hub is spent outfitting your party members, unlocking new combat skills, and preparing for the next battle. In this way, Fire Emblem Engage feels like a more focused take on the long-running tactical JRPG series.</p><p dir="ltr">Fire Emblem Engage follows a similar structure to other modern Fire Emblem games. Your time is split between the tactical tile-based combat and a hub area where you can interact with other characters. On the battlefield, Fire Emblem Engage brings back the traditional weapon triangle that the series is known for. Swords beat axes, axes beat spears, and spears beat swords. Taking advantage of the weapon triangle inflicts break, which prevents the defending unit from countering in that skirmish. Weapons outside of the triangle such as bows, daggers, and spell tomes are weak to physical attacks. As much as I enjoyed Three Houses (I played nearly 200 hours of it), I did miss the traditional weapon triangle. In past games, it gave specific weapons distinct strengths and weaknesses that forced me to carefully consider my party. The reintroduction of the weapon triangle could lead to a more balanced experience, especially for those who might have felt Three Houses was a bit too easy.</p><p dir="ltr">At the center of Engage’s combat is the Engage mechanic. As you progress through the story, you unlock Emblem Rings that can be equipped on any party member. Each Emblem Ring houses the spirit of a character from a previous Fire Emblem game, and when given to a party member, they can combine for improved stats and some powerful abilities. You can mix Emblem Rings with any character in your party for varying effects and strategies. Some combinations can lead to incredibly mobile party members, while others could significantly buff a character's strength stat. Some combinations may work better than others, but every party member can forge bonds with every classic character housed in an Emblem Ring. Like bonds formed between units, bonds between party members and Emblem Rings increase the effectiveness of that pair.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fire-emblem-engage-feels-like-a-leaner-tactical-jrpg/1100-6509956/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Oh yeah, and <strong>two free skins</strong>. If you miss some days, that's okay. You can catch up all the way through the end of the event on the morning of January 3.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortnite's Battle Royale modes are being affected too, of course. Coming out of the vault for Winterfest are the snowball launcher, a heavy weapon, and presents, which come with all sorts of quality loot inside.

<p>More classic Final Fantasy games could be coming to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 soon, as ESRB ratings for Final Fantasy I through VI have appeared online. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/zjtbub/final_fantasy_16_pixel_remaster_rated_by_esrb_for/">Spotted on Reddit</a> and screen-capped before the ESRB removed those console details, the Final Fantasy remasters have so far only been available on PC via Steam and mobile devices.</p><p>An announcement likely isn't too far away, as the 35th-anniversary celebrations of the Final Fantasy franchise will be this week. Square Enix plans to mark the occasion with a livestream that will run from December 13-18 on Niconico Live and will feature several Final Fantasy developers as guests <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202212/09285907.html">according to Famitsu</a>. Back in 2021, Square Enix mentioned in a Q&amp;A that it was willing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-collection-could-come-to-other-platforms-if-enough-people-request-it/1100-6494244/">port the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters to other platforms</a> if there was enough public interest from fans.</p><p>The Pixel Remaster series was first announced in 2021, with the release of the six classic Final Fantasy games being mostly well-received. Aside from complaints about the chosen font being either too small or too modern for these retro revivals, the games have accurately retained their original 8 and 16-bit visual charm. This was a major complaint for anyone who bought the mobile remakes of these classics several years ago, as Square Enix opted to smooth out the pixels in an effort to create a more modern--but horrifying to retro purists--art direction for the beloved games.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-could-finally-be-coming-to-switch-and-ps4/1100-6509976/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Next-Gen Update Review - Wind's Howlin'

<p>In The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, the sacred is always at war with the profane, and beauty is always at war with blood. The series has always contrasted its world's physical glamor with its intrinsic violence, but never has that contrast been this uneasy, this convulsive. That The Witcher 3 depicts the immediate brutality of battle in great detail is not a surprise; many games fill the screen with decapitated heads and gory entrails. It's the way this incredible adventure portrays the personal tragedies and underhanded opportunities that such battles provide that makes it so extraordinary.</p><p dir="ltr">It is more than its thematic turbulence that makes The Witcher 3 extraordinary, actually. Excellence abounds at every turn in this open-world role-playing game: excellent exploration, excellent creature design, excellent combat mechanics, excellent character progression. But the moments that linger are those that reveal the deep ache in the world's inhabitants. In one quest, you reunite two lovers, one of which is now a rotting hag, its tongue lasciviously lolling from its mouth. In another, a corpulent spouse-abuser must find a way to love two different lost souls, each of which test the limits of his affection. Don't worry that these vague descriptions spoil important events: they are simple examples of the obstacles every resident faces. On the isles of Skellige and in the city of Novigrad, there is no joy without parallel sorrow. Every triumph demands a sacrifice.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/416/4161502/2863627-witcher%20-%20beautiful%20sunsets%20awful%20corpses51.jpg"><img alt="Every horse Geralt has owned is called Roach.

Talk about an identity crisis. </figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">As returning protagonist Geralt of Rivia, you, too, face the anguish of mere existence, sometimes in unexpected, unscripted ways. The central story, which sees you seeking your ward and daughter figure Ciri, as well as contending with the otherworldly force known as the wild hunt, often forces this anguish upon you. But it was my natural exploration of the game's vast expanses that proved most affecting. At one point, I witnessed a woman sentenced to death, doomed to starve after being chained to a rock. It's a chilling sentence, of course, but it was only later, when I accidentally sailed past the tiny island where her corpse still rested, that the horror of her punishment sunk into my heart. The Witcher 3's story did not script this moment; it was merely a passing detail that might have been lost in the waves or overlooked in favor of the harpies circling overhead. Yet there she was, a reminder that my actions--actions that felt righteous and reasonable as I made them--allowed this woman to rot in this faraway place.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-next-gen-update-review-winds-howlin/1900-6416135/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
