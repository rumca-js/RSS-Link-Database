  <p id="9dRU2r">Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and former CEO of FTX, was denied bail on Tuesday after a Bahamian judge deemed him a flight risk, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/bankman-fried-appear-bahamas-court-us-unveil-charges-2022-12-13/">according to <em>Reuters</em></a>.

  <p id="iXBniN">Tidal, the high-bitrate quality music streaming service, is testing a new feature that lets its HiFi Plus subscribers play DJ.

<p id="miJNCr">Tidal DJ works like running your own live radio broadcast or a headphones-only silent party. It’s similar to remote sharing features from other streaming services, like Spotify’s <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/remote-group-session/">remote group session</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22577178/shareplay-how-to-apple-facetime-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-apple-tv-video-music">Apple’s SharePlay</a> — except you don’t have to know who the listeners are.

  <p id="3WWPqT">The esoteric indie title <em>Kentucky Route Zero </em>will be available Tuesday on iOS and Android as part of Netflix’s suite of mobile games. The narrative-focused game seems like one that will lend itself well to a mobile format, and after a more than six-month wait since publisher Annapurna Interactive said <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/A_i/status/1535319615898669056">would be coming to phones</a>, you can now get lost in its weird world from the smartphone in your pocket. </p>
<p id="x7keO7"><em>Kentucky Route Zero</em>, from developer Cardboard Computer, is difficult to describe. It’s not so much a game as a magical realism story that you experience in an interactive form.

  <p id="Je1wZA">The latest trailer for the upcoming <em>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One)</em> has just been released, offering a look at the chaos Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) and Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) encounter as they toss themselves into the multiverse.</p>
<p id="GudIUv">During the trailer, the duo comes across several other spider-people, and that includes some new faces, like Spider-Woman (Issa Rae) and the Spider-Man from the Insomniac-developed PlayStation game. We also get a look at an artfully drawn fight scene between Morales and Spider-Man 2099, along with a brief cameo from the legendary Stan Lee.</p>

<p id="QfTlWp">The SEC complaint accuses Bankman-Fried of executing a “years-long fraud” while diverting customers’ funds from FTX to his crypto trading firm, Alameda Research, then spending some of the funds on investments, real estate, and political donations. These charges specifically cite the more than $1.8 billion FTX received from equity investors since 2019, which includes $1.1 billion from investors in the US. </p>

The feature <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/11/emergency-sos-via-satellite-available-today-on-iphone-14-lineup/">launched in the US and Canada last month</a>, but as of today it’s available in France, Germany, Ireland, and the UK.</p>
<p id="aHA6b3">The feature is aimed at helping iPhone owners in emergency situations by letting them send messages (but not make traditional phone calls) to emergency services if cellular or Wi-Fi connectivity isn’t an option. After you try, and fail, to call emergency services the traditional way, the iPhone 14 will prompt you to “Report Emergency” and will present you with a questionnaire to gather...</p>

  <p id="xv5dvb">Tim Cook has tweeted an admission that Apple uses Sony image sensors in its iPhones as part of the CEO’s supplier tour of Japan. “We’ve been partnering with Sony for over a decade to create the world’s leading camera sensors for iPhone,” <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1602516736145858561">Cook tweeted</a>, and thanked Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida for showing him around the Kumamoto facility. A photo shows Cook being shown his company’s own smartphone, which is objectively very funny. </p>
<p id="PzNtsR">Apple largely keeps tight-lipped about the specifics of the hardware components that go into each iPhone, so outright confirming that it’s used Sony camera sensors for over a decade is notable. Apple’s website tends to just list <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/iphone-14-pro/specs/">the specs of each iPhone’s camera</a> — such as resolution, aperture, and field of view —...</p>

The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Damian Williams, <a href="https://twitter.com/SDNYnews/status/1602451395910803457">confirmed the arrest</a>, saying in a statement that “We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time.”</p>
