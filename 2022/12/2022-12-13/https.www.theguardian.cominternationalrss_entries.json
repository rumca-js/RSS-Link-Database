Much will be made of the finale\u2019s reveals, the slapstick demise of Coolidge\u2019s Tanya and the show\u2019s icily cynical core, but I would like to submit for recognition one of the second season\u2019s chief delights: Meghann Fahy\u2019s performance as deceptively layered, nouveau-riche housewife Daphne Sullivan.</p><p>Fahy, a Broadway and soap opera veteran best known as striving fashion assistant Sutton Brady on the Freeform series The Bold Type, has been rightfully hailed as the breakout star of a stacked ensemble that includes more established names as Coolidge, Michael Imperioli, F Murray Abraham, Aubrey Plaza and Theo James. It\u2019s not just because her incantation of Daphne is fascinating to watch \u2013 bubbly and seemingly aloof, inner calculations briefly rippling beneath her smooth-brained surface. It\u2019s that Fahy\u2019s Daphne is so much more interesting than the character, the blissfully apolitical wife to a skeevy finance bro, could be.</p> <a

legendary E2-E4, a foundational source for techno and ambient house</p><p>Although it might help, there\u2019s a fair chance you don\u2019t need to be standing behind the counter of a record shop to know what \u201cthe album with the chess cover\u201d refers to. Since its release in 1984, Manuel G\u00f6ttsching\u2019s E2-E4<em> \u2013 </em>iconic chessboard sleeve and all \u2013 has been heralded as a Year Zero for electronic minimalism by crate-diggers and newcomers alike. Some have gone further, declaring it the first electronic dance album. In any case, for G\u00f6ttsching, who died last week aged 70, it was just one of several giant leaps guided by a career-long reverence for the unrepeatable moment.<br /><br />Born in 1952 in West Berlin, G\u00f6ttsching spent his youth listening to opera at home and playing in blues bands with friends. It was with one of them, Hartmut Enke, that he later studied improvisation under Swiss avant-garde composer Thomas Kessler. Alongside fellow student <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/28/drumming-drones-and-drifting-bliss-10-of-klaus-schulzes-greatest-recordings\">Klaus Schulze</a>, the outgoing drummer of Tangerine Dream, they swiftly broke free from the world of blues-rock to form Ash Ra Tempel in 1970. Described by one early critic \u201cas the James Brown band on acid,\u201d their searing freakouts, captured on early 70s albums Ash Ra Tempel and Schwingungen, redrew the map for free-form psychedelia. Albums such as Seven Up <em>\u2013 </em>an avant-garde collaboration with countercultural guru Timothy Leary \u2013 proved a legitimate alternative to the norm, even for many fans of innovators such as Neu! and Can. </p><p><br /><br />From the first foreboding textures of Amboss, the sprawling opener from the band\u2019s 1971 self-titled debut, G\u00f6ttsching was a guitarist who seemed to intuitively grasp that spontaneity is often best harnessed within basic parameters. All it took was a cue or two \u2013 a couple of chords or some skeletal rhythmic motif \u2013 for mind-melting exploration to roam free. Released in 1975, his solo debut, Inventions for Electric Guitar (subtitled Ash Ra Tempel VI<em> </em>following the departure of Enke and Schulze) was a textbook example of his improvisational talent. Inspired by the cyclical electric organ of Terry Riley, its trance-inducing guitar mantras may have been the closest mid-70s rock came to mimicking the advent of digital audio sequencing. If Inventions for Electric Guitar<em> </em>proved anything it was that<em> </em>much like the vast careers of his peers, including Schulze and Neu! co-founder Michael Rother, G\u00f6ttsching\u2019s output was often most potent when it played with both chance and control.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/13/manuel-gottsching-electronic-music-will-endure-e2-e4\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/13/move-over-morricone-the-record-labels-rescuing-lost-italian-b-movie-scores", "title": "Move over Morricone!

The sweeping, seamless plains of gravity-defying digital matter are transformed into substantial chunks of steel and concrete, usually clad with a thin decorative shell to give the illusion of a solid, sculpted mass. It is a process that relies on extreme levels of precision, careful thought about how the multi-dimensional jigsaw will fit together, and exactly what forms of bolting, welding and fixing are required to simulate the flawless vision.<br /><br />Sometimes it goes wrong. What appeared to be a feasible junction of multi-curved panels on screen turns out to be an impossible thing to achieve with human hands, power tools and the laws of physics, in the face of immovable deadlines. The panels of steel and glass and terracotta don\u2019t always bend and swoop in the way the architect had hoped.</p><p>Nowhere is the gulf between digital promise and physical fact more spectacularly evident than at the new <a href=\"https://ocma.art/\">Orange County Museum of Art</a> (OCMA) in California, which stands as a $94m (\u00a377m) hymn to the difference between render and reality.

Sheets of buckled steel are screwed crookedly against the edge of the undulating facade, hastily cut tiles have been fitted with wonky abandon, while other parts of the building are literally held on with tape. A temporary clamp keeps part of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soffit\">soffit </a>from falling down, while glass balustrades lean at precarious angles, their oversized steel fixing plates bolted with Frankenstein glee.

In her search for a physical representation of the sound only she can hear, Jessica visits a recording studio where, with the help of an earnest young sound engineer, Hern\u00e1n (Juan Pablo Urrego), who turns out not to exist, she settles on one described as \u201cbody hits duvet hits wood bat\u201d. Typically of this film, body, duvet and wood bat are all commonplace objects but the grammar of their combination makes a surreal sort of poetry.

The strike \u2013 and the threat of striking \u2013 should be celebrated precisely because it underpins many rights and freedoms we now take for granted. Union struggles in the 19th century played a pivotal role in shortening the working day, and in the 20th century, in creating the weekend. In the postwar heyday of union power, they drove up incomes. Strikes are a profound social good.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/13/striking-antisocial-rishi-sunak-tory-union-labour-living-standards\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/dec/13/tanzania-charcoal-trade-deforestation", "title": "\u2018Means of survival\u2019: Tanzania\u2019s booming charcoal trade drives unchecked deforestation", "date_published": "2022-12-13 06:00:41+00:00", "description": "<p>As rising gas prices drive demand for the polluting fuel, illegal loggers depend on the trade to live \u2013 even as the forest disappears around them</p><p>Large swathes of Ruhoi forest reserve in eastern Tanzania now lay bare, the ground in some sections dry and scorched, covered with stumps and brittle and fallen trees.

Only by journeying, backward, from present to past, can we comprehend the choices that form and deform us. Fans of Stephen Sondheim, George Furth and Hal Prince still return to the problem of what went wrong with Merrily We Roll Along, the legendary Broadway failure that closed abruptly in 1981.

Informed by her 2012 Menier Chocolate Factory production, this version stars Jonathan Groff, Daniel Radcliffe and Lindsay Mendez as a trio of friends disillusioned after two decades amid the gutters and stars of Hollywood and Broadway. Friedman\u2019s interpretation will probably be regarded as a gold standard. But even here, despite that indelible sour-sweet score, the gold is short a few carats.
