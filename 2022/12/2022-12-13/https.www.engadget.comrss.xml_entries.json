In recent \u201cweeks,\u201d Twitter has reportedly not paid rent for its main headquarters in San Francisco and satellite offices in other countries. According to court documents obtained by <em>The Times</em>, the company has also refused to pay a $197,725 bill for charter flights Musk took during his first week at Twitter. Simultaneously, the social media website has continued to cut staff \u2013 despite Musk having recently told employees the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-done-with-job-cuts-blue-verified-062148989.html\"><ins>was done with layoffs</ins></a>. Among the most recent casualties include Nelson Abramson, the company\u2019s global head of infrastructure. On Monday, the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-dissolves-its-trust-and-safety-council-064143124.html\"><ins>disbanded its Trust and Safety Council</ins></a> of external advisors.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>According to <em>The Times</em>, Musk and other executives have also talked about the potential consequences of denying severance payments to the thousands of people who were let go from the company in recent weeks. When he first took ownership of Twitter, Musk reportedly considered dismissing many of the employees who were subsequently laid off without any severance. However, he eventually decided to give US employees at least one month of severance pay, a move that ensured the company was in compliance with state and federal labor laws.</p><p>Amid those cost-cutting efforts, Musk has reshaped Twitter\u2019s legal team in anticipation of the legal battles the company is likely to face in the near future. He recently dismissed Alex Spiro. The criminal defense lawyer was one of Musk\u2019s close personal allies. In 2019, he successfully defended the billionaire in his infamous <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-06-elon-musk-mini-sub-pedo-guy.html\"><ins>\u201cpedo guy\u201d defamation case.</ins></a> Musk had charged Spiro with leading the company\u2019s legal and policy teams but reportedly became displeased with his personal lawyer after finding out he had kept James Baker on as Twitter\u2019s deputy general counsel. Musk fired Baker after finding out the former FBI attorney had been responsible for reviewing the company\u2019s decision to restrict posts related to a 2020 article <em>The New York Post</em> published about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop.</p><p>Since then, Musk has reportedly brought over \u201cmore than half a dozen\u201d lawyers from SpaceX to fill the void left by Spiro and Baker. Among those who are now advising Twitter include SpaceX's Senior Vice President and General Counsel Tim Hughes. Anticipating potential litigation, Musk has also told employees not to pay travel invoices and other vendors the company owes money to for their services.</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mars-dust-devil-audio-nasa-perseverance-224215815.html?src=rss", "title": "Audio from a Martian dust devil captured for the first time", "date_published": "2022-12-13 22:42:15+00:00", "description": "<p>NASA announced today that the Perseverance rover has <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/status/425/experiencing-a-dust-devil/\">captured audio</a> from a Martian dust devil for the first time.

Scientists had to coordinate their instruments to boost the odds of recording a storm. The rover only records sound snippets lasting under three minutes and only does so eight times per month. That meant timing them for when dust devils are most likely to hit while pointing its cameras where they\u2019re most likely to approach. In this case, that preparation \u2014 and no small degree of luck \u2014 paid off.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of a previous case where so much data from so many instruments contributed to characterizing a single dust devil,\u201d said John Edward Moores, a planetary scientist at York University. \u201cHad the [camera] been pointing in a different direction or the microphone observation been scheduled just a few seconds later, key pieces of the story would be missing.

It won't be surprising if the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/honda-prologue-ev-design-reveal-160536773.html\">Prologue EV</a> and other future models use the technology, however.

The ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act (Averting the National Threat of Internet Surveillance, Oppressive Censorship and Influence, and Algorithmic Learning by the Chinese Communist Party) is meant to shut down access to TikTok and other apps that could theoretically funnel American user data to oppressive governments, censor news or otherwise manipulate the public.</p><p>The rationale echoes what US political leaders have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-wechat-executive-order-014615752.html\">argued for years</a>. While TikTok has taken efforts to distance its international operations from those in China, such as by <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-user-data-us-200500287.html\">storing US data domestically</a>, critics have argued that parent company ByteDance is ultimately at the mercy of the Chinese government. TikTok could potentially profile government workers and otherwise surveil Americans, according to the often-repeated claims.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Republican bill co-sponsors Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mike Gallagher tried to draw links between some ByteDance leadership and the Chinese Communist Party in an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/10/marco-rubio-ban-tiktok-america-china-mike-gallagher/\">opinion piece</a> in <em>The Washington Post</em> this November. At the time, 23 directors had previously worked for state-backed media, and &quot;at least&quot; 15 employees still did. The bill is also sponsored by House Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi.</p><p>In a statement, a TikTok spokesperson said it was &quot;troubling&quot; that members of Congress were putting forward legislation to ban the app rather than waiting for a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-revokes-trump-tiktok-wechat-orders-144643108.html\">national security review</a> to wind down. The bills will &quot;do nothing to advance&quot; national security, according to the company. The firm added that it would &quot;continue to brief&quot; Congress on plans developed under the watch of security officials. The social network has consistently <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-denies-allegations-forbes-061004399.html\">denied plans to track American users</a> or otherwise deliberately assist Chinese surveillance efforts in the country.</p><p>TikTok already faces some legal action. The states of Maryland and South Dakota have banned TikTok on government devices over security concerns. Indiana, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/indiana-tiktok-lawsuit-214110286.html\">sued TikTok</a> for allegedly deceiving users about China's data access and child safety violations. That lawsuit would fine TikTok and demand changes to the service's info handling and marketing claims.</p><p>Whether or not the bills become legislation isn't certain. President Biden <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-revokes-trump-tiktok-wechat-orders-144643108.html\">revoked former President Trump's orders</a> to ban TikTok downloads, and instead required a fresh national security review. He's not expected to override his own order. And while the bill sponsors characterize the measure as bipartisan, it's not clear the call for a TikTok ban has enough support to clinch the necessary votes and reach Biden's desk. To some degree, the ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act is more a signal of intent than a practical attempt to block TikTok.</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/imdb-actors-real-age-optional-remove-202906962.html?src=rss", "title": "IMDb now lets performers remove their age and personal details", "date_published": "2022-12-13 20:29:06+00:00", "description": "<p>IMDb announced today that entertainment professionals can now choose whether to display their age and other demographic information on their profiles.

The legislation is particularly problematic for Apple, as it outlaws many of the speedbumps the company has relied on to make it difficult for consumers to leave iOS.

Critically, it also mandates that platform holders allow for sideloading.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple has consistently lobbied against the practice, calling it a security and privacy risk.

Apple could open up major APIs and features, including those that control the iPhone's NFC and camera technologies, to outside developers. Historically, only the company's Wallet app and Apple Pay service have had access to the iPhone's NFC chip.

With iPadOS 16.2, which just arrived this afternoon, I think Apple has caught up with what it planned. There are two major new features on board here. First, Stage Manager multitasking now works across an external display, provided you\u2019re using an iPad with an M1 or M2 chip inside. Second, the collaborative brainstorming and productivity app Freeform is now available on the iPad (and on the iPhone and Mac, as well).&nbsp;</p><p>Freeform is one of the more flexible and customizable apps Apple has made in a long time. For me, the first thing it reminded me of is a more ambitious version of Apple\u2019s own Notes app. Over the years, Notes has become capable at handling a lot more than text \u2014 you can scan documents, add images, draw with the Apple Pencil on the iPad and more. The same can be said about Freeform, though it\u2019s much less of a text-first app.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>When you start a new document, you\u2019re met with a ever-expanding blank canvas. At the top of the screen are just a few interface elements, most significantly the five items that let you add content to your board. Those main categories are Apple Pencil; sticky notes; a library of about 700 shapes and icons; text boxes; and a general-purpose \u201cimport\u201d button that lets you pull in things from the Files app, your photo library or URLs you can paste in.</p><p>These features all seem pretty straightforward, but there\u2019s a lot of underlying complexity to them. A text box opens with simple black text on the white background, but you can adjust size, fonts, colors, format and drop in three different types of lists. The shapes you can add are numerous and varied; most of them are flat, 2D representations of things like geometric shapes, animals, people, food, and so forth. But you can break apart a shape into its component pieces and move them around individually, resize them, change the colors or just use the one part of it that you really want. And any time you interact with an element in Freeform, guide lines will appear to help you line it up with the content around it. You can also group individual elements (like a text box and a photo) so that they respond as a single object.</p><figure><img alt=\"iPadOS 16.2 Freeform shapes\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/b62366e0-7b10-11ed-befe-625b17875ffb\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Freeform is also pretty great at accepting different files and attachments. Links to things like articles on a web site or a YouTube video show up with the page title and a preview (unfortunately, YouTube videos don\u2019t play right in Freeform itself). Some things, like photos and audio files, do work right in Freeform though \u2014 you can tap a photo to see it full screen or an audio file to hear what\u2019s in it.</p><p>While Freeform works fine when using it on your own, Apple has clearly pitched it as a collaborative tool. I haven\u2019t been able to try that yet, but now that the software is out of beta I should get a chance soon. But like the other collaboration features Apple included in iPadOS 16 this year, it\u2019s easy to bring other people into a Freeform board. There\u2019s a share button in the top right corner of the app, and you can invite people via email, the Messages app or just by sharing a link.&nbsp;</p><p>When adding people via Messages, everyone in the thread is automatically added to the board as an editor (though you can change that if you want it to be read-only). Then, as people add their own content to the board, you can see what has changed via an activity feed. And for real-time collaboration, you can kick off a FaceTime call with everyone working on the document.</p><p>The updates to Stage Manager are more straightforward, mostly because we\u2019ve had a chance to test them already. If you\u2019re using an iPad with an M1 or M2 chip, you can connect an external display and extend your iPad\u2019s screen, rather than just mirror it. This means you can have different groups of apps running on both the iPad\u2019s built-in screen as well as the external monitor, just as you can on a Mac (or most other computers).&nbsp;</p><p>When you connect to a monitor, the external display is blank by default. But  if you move your cursor on to that screen and launch an app from the Dock, it\u2019ll pop up there. You can also click any open apps on the iPad screen and send it to the other display via the three dot menu at the top of the screen.&nbsp;</p><p>Just as on the iPad display, the layout of apps on your external display isn\u2019t fully customizable. Instead, there are a wide variety of sizes you can set them to, and as you add more apps to a space they dynamically rearrange themselves. You have some flexibility to move things where you want, but pixel-perfect manipulation like you\u2019re used to on a Mac isn\u2019t possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite these caveats, there\u2019s no doubt that using an iPad with an external display is a lot more useful than it was before. Previously, you could only mirror your iPad\u2019s display \u2014 being able to extend your iPad to a much larger screen is another big step towards making the tablet better suited for \u201creal work.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>As for Freeform, its usefulness will probably depend on how many Apple users there are in your orbit. If your workplace depends heavily on devices like Macs or iPads, it could gain some traction. But breaking a new tool into a workflow that\u2019s already been established can be difficult, so how popular Freeform will get remains a big question mark. Of course, it\u2019s not restricted to workplace use \u2014 maybe families where two partners are already using iPads will enjoy organizing vacations or other, more mundane life events with Freeform.&nbsp;</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-16-2-available-180625523.html?src=rss", "title": "Apple releases iOS 16.2 with always-on display changes and tighter security", "date_published": "2022-12-13 18:06:25+00:00", "description": "<p>Apple is finishing 2022 by releasing major software updates for its devices.

Not surprisingly, these bring cross-platform feature additions like Advanced Data Protection, Freeform and the revised Home app. WatchOS 9.2, meanwhile, adds the Home update as a workout for cyclists and runners wanting to improve their performance on a previously-completed route.

As a sequel to the highest-grossing film ever, which was criticized for its formulaic story (and the surprisingly <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2014/12/18/avatar-became-the-highest-grossing-film-of-all-time-while-leaving-no-pop-culture-footprint/?sh=e1b5b746159c\"><ins>small ripple it had on pop culture</ins></a>), the new movie is a genuine surprise. It's a sweeping epic that reflects on the nature of families, our relationship to the natural world and humanity's endless thirst for violence and plunder. Fans of the original film often had to make excuses for writer and director James Cameron's stilted script, but that's no longer the case for <em>The Way of Water</em>, thanks to additional help from Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa (who both worked on the recent criminally under-loved <em>Planet of the Apes</em> trilogy).</p><p>Perhaps most impressive, though, is that James Cameron has managed to craft the best high frame rate (HFR) movie yet. Certain scenes play back at 48 frames per second, giving them a smoother and more realistic sheen compared to the standard 24fps. That leads to 3D action scenes that feel incredibly immersive \u2014 at times HFR can make you forget that the lush alien wildlife on Pandora isn't real.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Avatar: The Way of Water\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/eedc25c0-7af3-11ed-bf7d-20fd7478a0f9\" style=\"height: 1055; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Fox/Disney</div></figure><p>Unlike the handful of high frame rate movies we've already seen \u2013 <em>The Hobbit </em>trilogy, as well as Ang Lee's <em>Gemini Man </em>and <em>Billy Lynn's Long Half-Time Walk</em> \u2013 the <em>Avatar</em> sequel deploys the technology in a unique way. Rather than using HFR throughout the entire movie, Cameron relies on it for major action sequences, while slower dialog scenes appear as if they're running at 24fps. To do that, the entire film actually runs at 48fps, while the calmer scenes use doubled frames to trick your brain into seeing them at the typical theatrical frame rate.</p><p>If this sounds a bit confusing, your brain may have a similar reaction while watching the film. <em>The Way of Water</em> often jumps from hyper-real HFR to pseudo-24 fps in the same scene \u2014 at one point, I counted around a dozen switches in a few minutes. This is a strategy Cameron has been discussing for years. In 2016, he noted that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-31-james-cameron-high-frame-rate-cinema-is-a-tool-not-a-format.html\"><ins>HFR is &quot;a tool, not a format,&quot;</ins></a> and later he <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/james-cameron-disagrees-ang-lee-high-frame-rate-avatar-1202184115/\"><ins>rejected Ang Lee's attempt</ins></a> at using HFR for <em>Gemini Man's</em> entire runtime.</p><p>Cameron's dual-pronged approach to HFR is bound to be controversial. Even for someone who appreciates what the technology has to offer \u2014 pristine 3D action scenes with no blurring or strobing \u2014 it took me a while to get used to flipping between high frame rate and 24 fps footage. With <em>Gemini Man</em>, my brain got used to the hyper-reality of HFR within 15 minutes. In <em>The Way of Water, </em>I was almost keeping an eye out for when the footage changed.</p><figure><img alt=\"Avatar: The Way of Water\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/eedb1451-7af3-11ed-b7c3-fedfd9134d6c\" style=\"height: 1055; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Fox/Disney</div></figure><p>Despite the distracting format changes, <em>The Way of Water\u2019s</em> high frame rate footage ultimately worked for me. At times, the film appears to be a window into the world of Pandora, with breathtaking shots of lush forests and lush oceans. It makes all of Cameron\u2019s creations, from enormous flying fish-like creatures that you can ride, to alien whales with advanced language, appear as if they\u2019re living and breathing creatures. HFR also works in tandem with the sequel's more modern CG animation, making the Na'vi and their culture feel all the more real.</p><p>&nbsp;Over the film\u2019s three hour and twelve-minute runtime, I eventually managed to see what the director was aiming for, even if his ambition exceeded his grasp.&nbsp; (Cameron, who has the world\u2019s first [<em>Avatar</em>] and third-highest grossing films [<em>Titanic</em>] under his belt, and who <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2014-08-01-deepsea-challenge-3d-review.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE119W84-dqQGv8OHXEDnfGt1NDQucvG9vrDjA615vt0SXh5_r_D0ySZ7NYUM7eaUy7U_ToHkYPlDguCCCZAH_vC-D178FxTzqXnO22qrg8Yy8agfPCv40ND6fWS-qqSEBVDzseIKiM68qL4GJPc6pbUKpVdiTVz-pEbgfe6xmqu\"><ins>dove into the Marianas Trench</ins></a> in a self-designed personal submarine, suggests you can use the bathroom anytime you want during <em>The Way of Water</em>.

But even though that revamp grossed over $70 million on its own, there hasn't been much discussion about how it integrated high frame rate footage. (I saw it on a Regal RPX screen, which offered 3D but no extra frames, sadly.) There's a better chance you'll be able to catch <em>Avatar: The Way of Water </em>exactly how Cameron intended. It'll be screening in 4K, HFR and 3D at all AMC Dolby Cinema locations and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/imax/comments/yyfwq0/avatar_the_way_of_water_imax_frame_rate_guide/\"><ins>select IMAX theaters</ins></a> (single laser screens get everything, some dual-laser screens will only offer 2K 3D with HFR). While you <em>could</em> see it in 2D, why would you?</p><section><img alt=\"Avatar: The Way of Water\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/eedaed40-7af3-11ed-bdfe-ab7c1544a24a\" /></section><p>After suffering through the interminable <em>Hobbit</em> movies in HFR, I figured the technology was mostly a waste of time, yet another money-grab that Hollywood can use to pump up ticket prices. Director Peter Jackson struggled to recreate the magic of his <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy, and amid production issues, he also failed to change the way he shot the <em>Hobbit</em> films to account for HFR.

The company has been rolling out <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/arturia-pigments-free-upgrade-soft-synth-35-m1-support-161634255.html\">regular updates</a> for a few years now, and each new version adds something worth getting excited about. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/arturia-pigments-3-free-update-super-synth-vst-hands-on-163304649.html\">New synth engines,</a> new effects, whole new utility sections \u2013 it\u2019s both a place for Arturia to experiment with new ideas, and show off some of highlights from its lineup of vintage emulation.</p><p>At first blush Pigments 4 seems like a comparatively minor update. There\u2019s some new effects, a handful of enhancements to the various oscillators, but there\u2019s not much to reach out and demand your attention from a simple headline. This seemingly subtle upgrade hides a lot of quality of life enhancements, though.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>For one, now you can simply drag and drop modulation sources to their target. Granted, clicking LFO one and then clicking on the filter cut off wasn\u2019t particularly difficult. But now you can just drag the little tab over an LFO to whatever you want to modulate. It should make Pigments a little less intimidating to those just learning how to navigate the synth. There\u2019s also now left and right arrows on multimode modules, like the filter, that lets you quickly change types, where previously you had to click and open a drop down menu to select a new option.</p><figure><img alt=\"Arturia Pigments 4\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/9b4259f0-7af0-11ed-b13f-c194dca2541a\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Arturia</div></figure><p>The most dramatic UI changes are thankfully optional. First is the new Play tab, which strips away most of the sound design options and focuses on a core set of tweakable parameters. You can\u2019t change effects here, or set modulation preferences. It\u2019s designed to just get you making noise without too many distractions. It\u2019s fine for live performance or if you prefer to stick with the presets, but hides a lot of the depth that makes Pigments so compelling.&nbsp;</p><p>The other major interface change is a bit of a head scratcher. See, while most companies are rushing to implement dark mode to save your eyes, Arturia has decided that Pigments is <em>too</em> dark and added a light mode. I\u2019m sure there are those out there who will enjoy its bright gray panels, but I\u2019m personally not a fan. Not only do I think the original theme is easier to stare at for prolonged periods of time, but it\u2019s also just more consistent. There are many elements of the interface that remain dark even in light mode and it looks a bit cobbled together.</p><p>That\u2019s a pretty minor nitpick though, considering that once you get past the UX, there\u2019s a handful of new toys to play with in Pigments 4. There\u2019s a new filter borrowed from the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/arturia-v-collection-9-grows-to-32-virtual-instruments-150052024.html\">MS-20 emulation</a>, ring mod in the wavetable oscillator, super unison in the analog oscillator, a dedicated mod oscillator, an improved bit crusher and (wait for it) shimmer reverb!</p><figure><img alt=\"Arturia Pigments 4\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/9b4232e0-7af0-11ed-b59f-df16e3e628db\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Arturia</div></figure><p>The MS-20 filter might seem unnecessary considering Pigments already had 10 different filter options, many with multiple modes, but it does bring something special to the table. Rather than using it as you would any other lowpass filter, the MS-20 begs to be run at extremes. Crank the resonance and turn on keyboard tracking, and you can transform simple white noise into a delicate plucky key sound with a subtle crackle. Or just crank the volume on it and hit it with the hottest signal you can (though make sure to turn down the master volume or you'll risk blowing out your ears) to get some crunchy saturation.</p><p>Ring Mod delivers some nice icy timbres. Though, this is not something that Pigments was exactly lacking before. It\u2019s a welcome addition, but definitely not something that you\u2019d miss too dearly if it quietly disappeared. The more exciting changes are to the Bit Crusher effect (as opposed to the one built into the sample engine). The addition of jitter, scale and new decimator options really let you fine tune the exact flavor of digital destruction you\u2019re looking for.</p><p>Oh, then of course there\u2019s the shimmer reverb. It does what it says on the tin. Personally I think it\u2019s an essential effect, and I\u2019m shocked Arturia hasn\u2019t added one until now. There\u2019s nothing about it that stands out particularly, but if you\u2019re using Pigments to create <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/arturia-efx-fragments-granular-vst-effect-193053457.html\">granular soundscapes</a> or ambient plucks, then you\u2019ll be thankful it\u2019s here.</p><p>Arturia also added 63 new wavetables, 67 new samples and 36 new noise types, plus a pile of new presets. And, if the new library of included patches isn\u2019t enough for you, there\u2019s also three new sound packs: Wavelengths Lo-fi, Wavelengths Neuro Bass and Wavelengths Cinematic to broaden your sonic palette.</p><p>Pigments 4 is available now as a free upgrade for existing owners. New customers have a chance to pick it up at an introductory price of $99 until January 4th, after which the price will go back up to $199.</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/first-fusion-reaction-ignition-155212785.html?src=rss", "title": "Scientists achieve fusion ignition, a major milestone in clean energy production", "date_published": "2022-12-13 15:52:12+00:00", "description": "<p>Scientists have just crossed one of the most important thresholds in the quest for fusion energy. A team at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-national-laboratory-makes-history-achieving-fusion-ignition\">created</a> the first known fusion reaction with a net energy gain \u2014 that is, it produced more energy than it consumed and resulted in ignition. The researchers achieved the feat on December 5th, when they used 192 lasers at the National Ignition Facility to blast a cylinder containing frozen hydrogen surrounded by diamond.</p><p>The reaction, which generated a flurry of X-rays, struck a fuel pellet of deuterium and tritium with 2.05 megajoules of energy. That, in turn, led to a wave of neutron particles and 3.15 megajoules of output. That gain was 'only' equivalent to about 1.5lbs of TNT, but that was enough to meet the criteria for fusion ignition.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"4a5e6f201ce14d08975a037612d6fc06\"></div><p>The development has been a long time coming. The National Ignition Facility started work in 2009, but it wasn't until 2014 that the installation's laser-based fusion technology produced a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2014-02-13-scientists-get-meaningful-energy-from-laser-based-nuclear-fusion.html\">meaningful volume of energy</a>. Progress accelerated in the past year, however. Lawrence Livermore generated a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/laser-powered-fusion-energy-breakthrough-134058739.html\">much larger amount</a> of energy in a test last August, producing an output equivalent to 70 percent of the energy needed to perform the reaction. An attempt in September generated 1.2 megajoules using the 2.05-megajoule blast.</p><p>The lab and the Energy Department are quick to caution that &quot;many&quot; advancements are still necessary before fusion reactors are practical enough to power homes.

The net energy gain also doesn't include the entire system required to run the laser systems. And of course, the developers need to improve scaling \u2014 a reactor would have to power enough households to justify its existence.</p><p>The National Ignition Facility also isn't intended as a generator research program. It's using fusion to test and maintain the US nuclear arsenal. Other organizations and companies will need to cooperate on civilian uses.</p><p>The Energy Department is in the midst of rebooting a coordinated fusion power effort, however. During the event, officials also noted that a functional plant wasn't as far off as you might think. While they didn't commit to a timeframe, they said it was less than the 50 or 60 years they might have predicted in the past. You might see the first commercial fusion reactor in your lifetime, to put it another way.</p><p>The technology could be vital to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/un-emissions-gap-report-climate-change-warning-144323723.html\">limiting global warming</a> and otherwise fighting climate change. While renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are more eco-friendly than coal, they don't always meet demand and can require large amounts of land. Solar also isn't as effective in regions where sunlight can be limited. Sufficiently powerful fusion reactors could achieve the dream of clean powerplants that have enough capacity to serve large populations without the radioactive waste of nuclear facilities.</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-2-in-1-laptops-173038508.html?src=rss", "title": "The best 2-in-1 laptops for 2022", "date_published": "2022-12-13 15:45:56+00:00", "description": "<p>The perfect hybrid machine that\u2019s just as good a tablet as it is a laptop still doesn\u2019t exist.

If you want something around $500 that\u2019s thin, lightweight and long-lasting, you\u2019re better off this year looking at a conventional laptop (like those on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html\">our best budget PCs list</a>).</p><figure><img alt=\"Apple iPad Pro 12.9 2020\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c7370210-25c8-11eb-bfef-f2bf92a9b702\" /><figcaption>Chris Velazco / Engadget </figcaption></figure><p>When you\u2019re shopping for a 2-in-1, there are some basic criteria to keep in mind. First, look at the spec sheet to see how heavy the tablet is (alone, and with the keyboard). Most modern hybrids weigh less than 2 pounds, with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/surface-pro-9-5g-review-sq3-arm-173012304.html\">the 1.94-pound Surface Pro 9</a> being one of the heaviest around. The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2022-m2-review-140026198-140026510-140026377-140026181.html\">iPad Pro 12.9 (2022)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s-8-review-in-a-class-of-its-own-132946024.html\">Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Tab S8+</a> are both slightly lighter. If the overall weight of the tablet and its keyboard come close to 3 pounds, you\u2019ll be better off just getting an ultraportable laptop.</p><p>You\u2019ll also want to opt for an 11-inch or 12-inch screen instead of a smaller 10-inch model. The bigger displays will make multitasking easier, plus their companion keyboards will be much better spaced. Also, try to get 6GB of RAM if you can for better performance \u2014 you\u2019ll find this in the base model of the Galaxy Tab S7+, while this year\u2019s iPad Pro and the Surface Pro 8 start with 8GB of RAM.</p><p>Finally, while some 2-in-1s offer built-in LTE or 5G connectivity, not everyone will want to pay the premium for it. An integrated cellular radio makes checking emails or replying to messages on the go far more convenient. But it also often costs more, and that\u2019s not counting what you\u2019ll pay for data. And, as for 5G \u2014 you can hold off on it unless you live within range of a mmWave beacon. Coverage is still spotty and existing nationwide networks use the slower sub-6 technology that\u2019s barely faster than LTE.</p><h2>Best overall: Surface Pro 9 (Intel)</h2><p></p><p>There\u2019s no beating the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NzA3MTYwNS1kNGRmLTQ5NGUtOGQ5Yy1jOWMyMzZiOGJiMzgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi11cy9kL3N1cmZhY2UtcHJvLTkvOTN2a2Q4bnA0ZnZrIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5MTgzMTRhNS1hMGZkLTMzYTAtYjkzMC0xYzMyOGU5ZmFjZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAditFpxk7o-jNnrHRj6Ef83ha3Q8BqT9-E7pLIgCMNlu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-9%2F93vkd8np4fvk\">Surface series</a> when it comes to 2-in-1s.

But it\u2019ll also cost you an extra $300, making it the most expensive case on this list by a lot. The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2021-m1-review-liquid-retina-xdr-5g-features-price-130049005.html\">iPad</a> also lacks a headphone jack and its webcam is awkwardly positioned along the left bezel when you prop it up horizontally, so be aware that it\u2019s still far from a perfect laptop replacement. Still, with its sleek design and respectable battery life, the iPad Pro 12.9 is a good 2-in-1 for Apple users.</p><h2>Best for Android users: Samsung Galaxy Tab S8+</h2><p></p><p>While Windows is better than iPadOS and Android for productivity, it lags the other two when it comes to apps specifically designed for touchscreens.

The main caveat is that Android isn\u2019t great as a desktop OS, even with the benefits of Android 12L. And while Samsung\u2019s DeX mode offers a somewhat workable solution, it has plenty of quirks.</p><p><em>Cherlynn Low contributed to this report.</em></p><p></p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-mini-m1-512gb-lowest-price-144002661.html?src=rss", "title": "Apple's 512GB Mac mini M1 drops to a record low of $750", "date_published": "2022-12-13 14:40:02+00:00", "description": "<p>This might be your best opportunity yet to get a modern Mac desktop below sticker price while still having enough storage for everyday use.

The coating lays gold between layers of titanium oxide, which amplifies the heating effect through refraction and protects the gold against wear \u2013 titanium is much tougher. And while gold is pricey, the amount needed is so small it shouldn't add much to the price of your glasses if the tech makes its way into mainstream spectacles.</p><p>\u2013 Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn\u2019t just a</em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/\"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> \u2013  it\u2019s also a daily podcast.

It alleges that Bankman-Fried &quot;concealed his diversion of FTX customers' funds to [the] crypto trading firm Alameda Research while raising more than $1.8 million from investors.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, the US Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also announced charges against Bankman-Fried in parallel actions, according to the SEC.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>&quot;We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,&quot; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &quot;The alleged fraud committed by Mr. Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws.&quot;</p><p>The SEC alleges that since at least May 2019, FTX raised $1.8 billion from equity investors, including $1.1 billion from 90 US investors alone. Bankman-Fried promoted the exchange as a safe trading platform with &quot;sophisticated, automated measures to protect customer assets,&quot; it said. In reality, though, Bankman-Fried orchestrated a fraud to conceal the diversion of customer funds to his privately-held crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research.&nbsp;</p><p>That fund was given special treatment, &quot;including an unlimited 'line of credit' funded by the platform's customers and exempting Alameda from certain key FTX risk mitigation measures,&quot; the commissioner added. And finally, customers were exposed to undisclosed risk from FTX's exposure to Alameda holdings of &quot;overvalued, illiquid assets such as FTX-affiliated tokens.&quot; It further alleges that Bankman-Fried used commingled FTX customer funds to make &quot;undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases and large political donations.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Bankman-Fried was set to be testifying today in Congress, but that may not happen now. In a draft transcript of his testimony seen by <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/12/13/exclusive-transcript-the-full-testimony-sbf-planned-to-give-to-congress/\"><em>Forbes</em></a>, he would have led by saying &quot;I fucked up.&quot; Later in the transcript, Bankman-Fried claims Alameda's position on the platform was twice as large as displayed on FTX's dashboards due to &quot;a historical accounting quirk&quot;, as opposed to any malfeasance. He also planned to say that FTX's US business is fully solvent and could pay back customers immediately. Among other statements, he notes that he was pressured into filing for Chapter 11, and that ultimately the Chapter 11 documents were filed against his wishes.</p><p>The SEC is seeking injunctions including barring Bankman-Fried from future securities dealings, seizing alleged ill-gotten gains, a civil penalty and an officer and director bar. &quot;FTX operated behind a veneer of legitimacy,&quot; said SEC enforcement director Surbir S. Grewal. &quot;But as we allege in our complaint, that veneer wasn\u2019t just thin, it was fraudulent.&quot;</p>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/iphone-14-sos-satellite-france-germany-ireland-uk-105506913.html?src=rss", "title": "Apple's iPhone 14 Emergency SOS feature goes live in France, Germany, Ireland and the UK", "date_published": "2022-12-13 10:55:06+00:00", "description": "<p>As <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-apple-watch-series-8-is-50-off-ahead-of-black-friday-210357649.html\">promised</a>, Apple has <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VrL25ld3Nyb29tLzIwMjIvMTIvZW1lcmdlbmN5LXNvcy12aWEtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWF2YWlsYWJsZS1pbi1mcmFuY2UtZ2VybWFueS1pcmVsYW5kLWFuZC10aGUtdWsvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwZDZhNmQyNy05N2YwLTRiNjYtODM3ZC03NDNlOWRiMDhkZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaavV9PrD8-ENOmVQyKX6Ktk91zAdX6aUd8uya84cCVn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fuk%2Fnewsroom%2F2022%2F12%2Femergency-sos-via-satellite-available-in-france-germany-ireland-and-the-uk%2F\">expanded</a> its iPhone 14 Emergency SOS satellite feature to France, Germany, Ireland and the UK after <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VrL25ld3Nyb29tLzIwMjIvMTIvZW1lcmdlbmN5LXNvcy12aWEtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWF2YWlsYWJsZS1pbi1mcmFuY2UtZ2VybWFueS1pcmVsYW5kLWFuZC10aGUtdWsvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwZDZhNmQyNy05N2YwLTRiNjYtODM3ZC03NDNlOWRiMDhkZjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaavV9PrD8-ENOmVQyKX6Ktk91zAdX6aUd8uya84cCVn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fuk%2Fnewsroom%2F2022%2F12%2Femergency-sos-via-satellite-available-in-france-germany-ireland-and-the-uk%2F\">launching it</a> in the US and Canada.

Zaslav previously talked about entering the free ad-supported TV streaming space, and the sci-fi shows could apparently be offered on a future service with that business model. If that does happen, the second half of <em>The Nevers</em> \u2014 a show set in Victorian London that follows a group of women who manifest abnormal abilities \u2014 will debut on that service.

When Twitter <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-09-twitter-safety-council.html\">formed the council</a> in 2016, it said the group's purpose is to make the website a less toxic place so that \"anyone, anywhere can express themselves safely and confidently.\"&nbsp;</p><p>More members were on the verge of resigning before the group was dissolved, Larry Magid, chief executive of Silicon Valley nonprofit ConnectSafely, told <em>The Post</em>. He said: \"By disbanding [the council], we got fired instead of quit.

There are things I would give anything to be able to do over again,\u201d Bankman-Fried recently tried to explain to the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8wMS9idXNpbmVzcy9kZWFsYm9vay9zYW0tYmFua21hbi1mcmllZC1kZWFsYm9vay1pbnRlcnZpZXctdHJhbnNjcmlwdC5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMWJiN2E3Mi1hYThkLTQ2ODktOGQ3Zi04ZWIyMTRjYjZjYzMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWugCynsDpFl3Vkld5RExnUsDYKycJAvbaNzv55Ij-b6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2022%2F12%2F01%2Fbusiness%2Fdealbook%2Fsam-bankman-fried-dealbook-interview-transcript.html&amp;uuid=UD3o8O66ZwiTOPde0375\"><em>New York Times</em></a>. \u201cI did not ever try to commit fraud on anyone.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>The Bahamian government is also being accused of collusion \u2014 not by the DoJ, but rather FTX itself. Attorneys for the company <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.188450/gov.uscourts.deb.188450.203.0.pdf\">asserted on Monday</a> (ahead of the arrest news) that the Bahamas as a governing entity had colluded with Bankman-Fried to help move the ill-gotten funds from all those suspicious transactions that took place right before bankruptcy into crypto-wallets controlled by Bahamian regulators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Bankman-Fried stepped down from his role of CEO at FTX in November and was replaced by John J. Ray III, an executive who was also helmed Enron through its own bankruptcy proceedings. In his prepared remarks for Tuesday's now-postponed congressional hearings, Ray painted a bleak picture of FTX's late stage management and operations.&nbsp;</p><p>In it he says that FTX went on a $5 billion spending spree in late 2021 and early 2022, &quot;buying a myriad of businesses and investments, many of which may be worth only a fraction of what was paid for them,&quot; as well as making numerous loans and payments amounting to more than $1 billion, &quot;to insiders.&quot; Those funds were also co-mingled with money from Bankman-Fried's other venture Alameda Research, which also used client funds to engage in high-risk margin trading.&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on what the Southern District Attorney's office unseals tomorrow, Bankman-Fried could be going away for a very long time. Former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes and COO Sunny Balwani just got 11 and 12 years in prison, respectively, for their roles in the medical company's massive fraud case. Ponzi Scheme king Bernie Madoff got 150 years for his shenanigans in 2009, and in 2006, Jeff Skilling was handed 24 years for his role in Enron's downfall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p><em>Developing...</em></p>", "persistent": false}], "source url": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "source title": "Engadget"}
