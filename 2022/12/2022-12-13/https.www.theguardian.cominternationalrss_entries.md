It was mainly because nobody inside this arena could take their eyes off him.</p><p>Messi got Argentina up and running with a cooly converted penalty – his fifth goal of the tournament, taking him level with France’s Kylian Mbappé in the race for the Golden Boot – and he was involved at the beginning of the killer second for Julián Álvarez.

As the first African country to get to the last four of a World Cup, Morocco have 'broken the glass ceiling' and changed the conversation.&nbsp; Ames describes the team's 'flair and spontaneity' in high-pressure situations, which allows them to score despite being a relatively defensive team.

We discussed a whole variety of things on that first meeting, including his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/02/beware-gaia-theory-climate-crisis-earth">Gaia theory,</a> and I came away hugely impressed by the extraordinary fluidity of his mind, which ranged over many, many disciplines. I’ve met some very clever people, but I think he was closest to genius. He said he benefited from never having a regular university post; he never had to specialise. He used to tell me he got his schooling as a boy from Brixton public library and visits to the Science Museum.</p><p>I’d read Gaia when it came out and been very impressed by it. Partly because contrary to what many people claimed it seemed to me both rigorously scientific and rigorously Darwinian. Jim believed life was closely interconnected, and in some ways self-regulating. Some of the more mechanistic Darwinists, Dawkins and others, objected to that. Others wanted to find a mysticism in the idea of Gaia, but that was never there.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/13/obituaries-2022-james-lovelock-remembered-by-john-gray">Continue reading...</a>

Again. Some observers may question the sporting and political neutrality of this exercise, or quibble with the methodology and sample size, but we’re just presenting events as they happen, without comment or spin. So congratulations to Croatia for making it through to the final!</p><p><strong>A living legend will run out of road tonight. </strong>Lionel Messi wants to put those GOAT arguments to bed by single-handedly dragging Argentina, Maradona-style, to the top of the world. Luka Modrić, one of only two players to break the Messi-Ronaldo Ballon d’Or duopoly of the last 14 years, dreams of another masterclass in overachievement with four-million-strong Croatia. Both of their teams are more than capable of winning this World Cup; both are far from perfect; only one can make it to the final. Good luck calling it, but this much we do know: in a few hours, one of our 35 and 37-year-old superheroes will be smacked flush in the face with the realisation that their World Cup dream will almost certainly remain unfulfilled for eternity.

How did happy ever after come back in fashion?</p><p></p><p>‘The world has felt particularly unpredictable for the last few years,” says <a href="https://www.emilyhenrybooks.com/">Emily Henry</a>, a bestselling author of romance fiction. For Henry, these tough times – ever-changing prime ministers and a global pandemic among them – are “exactly why” there has been a boom in romance fiction. With everything else going wrong, she says, readers want their happily ever afters. “When you’re feeling anxious or overwhelmed, it’s such a gift to pick up a book that you know might put your heart through the wringer but will ultimately turn out OK” she adds.</p><p>In the UK, sales of romance novels are at their highest since 2012, when Fifty Shades of Grey hit the charts. An estimated 14.3m were sold between January and August this year across print and digital, according to statistics from Nielsen BookData. Sales reached just over 11m for the same period in 2020 and since then there has been a steady year-on-year rise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/13/love-boom-romance-novels-biggest-10-years-young-readers">Continue reading...</a>

The season finale, which aired this week (spoilers ahead), stuck the landing and <a href="https://www.theringer.com/tv/2022/12/12/23505968/the-white-lotus-season-2-finale-recap-review-analysis">confirmed</a> creator, writer and director Mike White’s vision of “<a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/the-white-lotus-season-2-set-visit.html">a bedroom farce with teeth</a>”. Much will be made of the finale’s reveals, the slapstick demise of Coolidge’s Tanya and the show’s icily cynical core, but I would like to submit for recognition one of the second season’s chief delights: Meghann Fahy’s performance as deceptively layered, nouveau-riche housewife Daphne Sullivan.</p><p>Fahy, a Broadway and soap opera veteran best known as striving fashion assistant Sutton Brady on the Freeform series The Bold Type, has been rightfully hailed as the breakout star of a stacked ensemble that includes more established names as Coolidge, Michael Imperioli, F Murray Abraham, Aubrey Plaza and Theo James. It’s not just because her incantation of Daphne is fascinating to watch – bubbly and seemingly aloof, inner calculations briefly rippling beneath her smooth-brained surface. It’s that Fahy’s Daphne is so much more interesting than the character, the blissfully apolitical wife to a skeevy finance bro, could be.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/13/white-lotus-daphne-sullivan-character-meghann-fahy">Continue reading...</a>

## Manuel Göttsching laid the groundwork for generations of electronic musicians

<p>The restlessly innovative German guitarist went on to make records including the legendary E2-E4, a foundational source for techno and ambient house</p><p>Although it might help, there’s a fair chance you don’t need to be standing behind the counter of a record shop to know what “the album with the chess cover” refers to. Since its release in 1984, Manuel Göttsching’s E2-E4<em> – </em>iconic chessboard sleeve and all – has been heralded as a Year Zero for electronic minimalism by crate-diggers and newcomers alike. Some have gone further, declaring it the first electronic dance album. In any case, for Göttsching, who died last week aged 70, it was just one of several giant leaps guided by a career-long reverence for the unrepeatable moment.<br /><br />Born in 1952 in West Berlin, Göttsching spent his youth listening to opera at home and playing in blues bands with friends. It was with one of them, Hartmut Enke, that he later studied improvisation under Swiss avant-garde composer Thomas Kessler. Alongside fellow student <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/28/drumming-drones-and-drifting-bliss-10-of-klaus-schulzes-greatest-recordings">Klaus Schulze</a>, the outgoing drummer of Tangerine Dream, they swiftly broke free from the world of blues-rock to form Ash Ra Tempel in 1970. Described by one early critic “as the James Brown band on acid,” their searing freakouts, captured on early 70s albums Ash Ra Tempel and Schwingungen, redrew the map for free-form psychedelia. Albums such as Seven Up <em>– </em>an avant-garde collaboration with countercultural guru Timothy Leary – proved a legitimate alternative to the norm, even for many fans of innovators such as Neu! and Can. </p><p><br /><br />From the first foreboding textures of Amboss, the sprawling opener from the band’s 1971 self-titled debut, Göttsching was a guitarist who seemed to intuitively grasp that spontaneity is often best harnessed within basic parameters. All it took was a cue or two – a couple of chords or some skeletal rhythmic motif – for mind-melting exploration to roam free. Released in 1975, his solo debut, Inventions for Electric Guitar (subtitled Ash Ra Tempel VI<em> </em>following the departure of Enke and Schulze) was a textbook example of his improvisational talent. Inspired by the cyclical electric organ of Terry Riley, its trance-inducing guitar mantras may have been the closest mid-70s rock came to mimicking the advent of digital audio sequencing. If Inventions for Electric Guitar<em> </em>proved anything it was that<em> </em>much like the vast careers of his peers, including Schulze and Neu! co-founder Michael Rother, Göttsching’s output was often most potent when it played with both chance and control.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/13/manuel-gottsching-electronic-music-will-endure-e2-e4">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From the 1960s, Italy’s thriving film industry pumped out commercial movies that often had better soundtracks than they deserved.

The multi-instrumentalist had composed all the music for the low-budget crime flick, its title an obvious attempt to forge artificial links to Hollywood hit The Godfather, and the theatre was packed with an audience there to support a son of the city.</p><p>D’Auria had been recruited by the movie’s director, Nardo Bonomi. “He was always smoking this big cigar, he was very chill,” D’Auria recalls today. Bonomi showed him some scenes and the script, and D’Auria got to work.

<p>As a miserable year limps towards its end, let’s talk about the silly trends that have cut through the gloom. Sorry if you came here for geopolitics</p><p>Want to play a fun end-of-2022 game? That was a rhetorical question, I’m afraid. You have no choice. They’re compulsory at this time of year. In this game you have to answer the question: “Is this the name of a trend widely discussed by the media in 2022, or is it a deranged combination of words that I just made up?” Four of the following are the former and one is the latter. Here we go: 1) frazzled Englishwoman, 2) goblin mode, 3) butter boards, 4) cabbage circles, 5) quiet quitting.</p><p>Before I reveal the answer, I want to point out that this was a surprisingly difficult quiz to devise. I’d think of something ridiculous, then Google it and find out that it was an actual trend. (And by “trend” I mean a phrase that a TikToker coined and content-hungry media people, such as myself, wrote frantic thinkpieces about.) But the answer, before you all die of suspense, is number four. Yep, even the <a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/57763/1/frazzled-english-woman-tiktok-fashion-trend-forecast-love-actually-christmas">frazzled Englishwoman</a> trend was real.

<p>I’ve been playing Dungeons and Dragons since I was a kid, but my first time directing the action was daunting. I certainly wasn’t expecting what came next</p><p>Four bedraggled adventurers stand together on the shore of a desolate island, shivering in the evening mist. They don’t know each other, and their motives for being here are unclear. But as they make stilted conversation they see, emerging from the briny waters, figures dressed in the rags of sailor outfits, moaning and shuffling and horrible. The adventurers stand around, roll some dice and chat some more, as the undead seamen lurch ever closer. Looking on at this desperate scene, I think to myself, “What the hell? Why can’t anyone make a decision? We’ve been here for half an hour! We’ve not even begun the proper adventure yet!”</p><p>Dungeons and Dragons has always been there in the background of my life. When I was a kid in the late 70s, my dad’s best friend got into it; he’d show me the rule books and dice and tried to explain to me that this was a game about imagination, about pretending to be elves and wizards and warriors on a completely made up adventure. In the 1980s, as I got into video games, we saw the first fantasy adventures based around D&amp;D lore – games with lots of stats on screen, and monsters inspired by Lord of the Rings. Then finally in the 90s I played with a group of friends at university. We huddled in cold rooms with rulebooks, character sheets and cheap supermarket cider and quested into the night. But I was never the Dungeon Master.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/dec/13/first-time-as-a-d-and-d-dungeon-master-dungeons-and-dragons">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With ambitiously fractured form, this $94m gallery is open to visitors – if they can find their way inside – but its wonkily assembled parts are a long way from complete</p><p>There is a critical point in the creation of contemporary, computer-aided architecture where the elaborate forms conjured on screen must be translated into physical reality. The sweeping, seamless plains of gravity-defying digital matter are transformed into substantial chunks of steel and concrete, usually clad with a thin decorative shell to give the illusion of a solid, sculpted mass. It is a process that relies on extreme levels of precision, careful thought about how the multi-dimensional jigsaw will fit together, and exactly what forms of bolting, welding and fixing are required to simulate the flawless vision.<br /><br />Sometimes it goes wrong. What appeared to be a feasible junction of multi-curved panels on screen turns out to be an impossible thing to achieve with human hands, power tools and the laws of physics, in the face of immovable deadlines. The panels of steel and glass and terracotta don’t always bend and swoop in the way the architect had hoped.</p><p>Nowhere is the gulf between digital promise and physical fact more spectacularly evident than at the new <a href="https://ocma.art/">Orange County Museum of Art</a> (OCMA) in California, which stands as a $94m (£77m) hymn to the difference between render and reality. From a distance, its sinuous white flanks buckle and bend with the trademark fractured geometries of its architects, the Los Angeles practice <a href="https://www.morphosis.com/architecture/270/">Morphosis</a>. The facade rears up around a corner, folding in on itself to embrace a roof terrace, with a similar wayward energy to the torqued steel plates of a rusty <a href="https://henrysegerstrom.com/home/philanthropy/public-art/connector/">Richard Serra sculpture</a> that stands outside.<br /><br />But, as you approach the building, you see that the ruptured, splintered aesthetic goes beyond the sculptural moves alone. Sheets of buckled steel are screwed crookedly against the edge of the undulating facade, hastily cut tiles have been fitted with wonky abandon, while other parts of the building are literally held on with tape. A temporary clamp keeps part of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soffit">soffit </a>from falling down, while glass balustrades lean at precarious angles, their oversized steel fixing plates bolted with Frankenstein glee. The shop of horrors continues inside, where sheets of painted foam-board stand in place of <a href="https://www.peakroofingconstruction.com/blog/commercial-roofing-coping-vs-fascia/">steel coping</a>, cracked glass floors line precipitous aerial walkways, and suspended ceilings appear to have been cobbled together from whatever leftover bits were lying around.

<p>Without a plan in place to minimise infection, a ‘moving on’ strategy leaves vulnerable people behind</p><p>As the season of Christmas work parties and drinks with friends begins, it feels a distance from the December of two years ago, at the height of the pandemic. We will hug our grandparents, hardly remembering a time when that was anything remarkable. Perhaps that’s why the news that Covid infections in the UK have <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-cases-in-uk-rise-above-one-million-12760213">passed 1m cases</a> again has barely raised a murmur.</p><p>Months of lockdowns and the grief of losing our loved ones, often without being able to say goodbye, was a collective trauma, and one that we have not dealt with as a nation.

There is a noticeable – and understandable – urge to “move on” from the pandemic, even as it still happens around us. Ministers hardly help, talking of “post-Covid” just as ICU beds fill up again.</p><p>Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/13/britain-forget-covid-moving-on-vulnerable-economy">Continue reading...</a>

Brenda had been acquired by a larger company that made software for property managers, and now thousands of properties across the country had put her to work.</p><p>Brenda, the recruiter told me, was a sophisticated conversationalist, so fluent that most people who encountered her took her to be human.</p><p><strong>&gt; Hi!

<p>Tilda Swinton is a florist attuned to surreal frequencies of the Amazon in Thai film-maker Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s slowly beautiful and mysterious  English-language debut </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/06/the-50-best-films-movies-of-2022-in-the-uk">50 best films of 2022 in the UK</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/2022-in-culture">More on the best culture of 2022</a></li></ul><p>A woman awakes to an eerie cacophony of car alarms apparently triggered by a loud boom. Is it gunfire, or a break-in? Where are we? And who is the woman who inhabits this supremely dislocated world? The simple answer is that she is Jessica, a market gardener who grows orchids in the Colombian city of Medellín but is currently in Bogotá to be at her sister’s hospital bedside, from which she views the mountainous countryside through a crack in the curtains. But nothing is as it seems in this slow-drawing film from Thai artist and film-maker Apichatpong Weerasethakul, which spools out like one of the auditory hallucinations from which Tilda Swinton’s scrupulously introverted Jessica suffers.</p><p>By slowing the camera down to a glacial speed, Weerasethakul compels viewers to become listeners: the scrape of a chair across a floor, a backfiring bus, a loud thud as a stray dog wanders across a square, and the recurrent thrum of heavy rainfall: all appear to tell ominous stories that are dreamlike and rooted in reality. In her search for a physical representation of the sound only she can hear, Jessica visits a recording studio where, with the help of an earnest young sound engineer, Hernán (Juan Pablo Urrego), who turns out not to exist, she settles on one described as “body hits duvet hits wood bat”. Typically of this film, body, duvet and wood bat are all commonplace objects but the grammar of their combination makes a surreal sort of poetry. You can feel it without having any idea what it means.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/13/best-films-of-2022-in-the-uk-no-9-memoria">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Assembled after the fact, these ‘diaries’ strain the usual definition – and the patience of those wanting a fuller account of government mistakes</p><p>If you want to get under the skin of politics, nothing beats a good diary.</p><p>And what distinguishes the best – from Alan Clark and Tony Benn to Alastair Campbell and more recently Sasha Swire – is the willingness to be vulnerable. A diarist’s job is to capture how it felt in the heat of the moment, however mortifying it might be to read in retrospect. Everything else is just publicity. Or in the case of Matt Hancock, who never actually kept a diary but hasn’t let that stop him publishing one, a book concocted after the event (but before the public inquiry) with the help of journalist Isabel Oakeshott from a mishmash of old papers, notes and emoji-laden WhatsApps. And with the selective benefit of hindsight, what the former health secretary mainly sees is – surprise! – all the times he was brilliantly prescient, and all the times his Downing Street nemesis Dominic Cummings wasn’t. If you couldn’t bear watching him on I’m a Celebrity, I’m afraid this book may go down like a plate of sheep’s unmentionables.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/13/pandemic-diaries-by-matt-hancock-review-rewriting-history">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Don’t believe Rishi Sunak or other Tory union-busters: a strong Labour movement raises everyone’s living standards</p><p>Respect for tradition, we are told, underpins the Conservative party. But there’s one tradition for which it has unwavering contempt – strike action: a part of our culture and heritage it has ferociously and instinctively demonised as an antisocial attack on the general public. Tories are known to extol the virtues of rugged individualism, but it seems the collective suddenly matters when industrial action is declared. Then, it seems, society – which in previous Tory eras was doubted to even exist – becomes a totem to be protected from sinister forces, from a malign and externalised striking rabble.</p><p>Strikes bring inconvenience. Of course they do. They disrupt our normal life, our plans, our expectations. But the concentrated attempt to stigmatise the very notion of the strike is something that must be resisted. The strike – and the threat of striking – should be celebrated precisely because it underpins many rights and freedoms we now take for granted. Union struggles in the 19th century played a pivotal role in shortening the working day, and in the 20th century, in creating the weekend. In the postwar heyday of union power, they drove up incomes.

<p><strong>New York Theatre Workshop, New York</strong></p><p>The infamous 1981 disaster has returned off-Broadway with help from Jonathan Groff and Daniel Radcliffe</p><p>It is a paradox of human existence that while we experience life forward, we understand it in reverse. Only by journeying, backward, from present to past, can we comprehend the choices that form and deform us. Fans of Stephen Sondheim, George Furth and Hal Prince still return to the problem of what went wrong with Merrily We Roll Along, the legendary Broadway failure that closed abruptly in 1981. That’s probably why the show receives a significant revival every decade or so. Surely one day we’ll understand. Surely one day we’ll get it right.</p><p>It’s doubtful that anyone will get it righter than director Maria Friedman. A former actor and a sensitive and lucid interpreter of Sondheim’s work, she lends clarity and humanity to the revival of Merrily now playing at New York Theatre Workshop. Informed by her 2012 Menier Chocolate Factory production, this version stars Jonathan Groff, Daniel Radcliffe and Lindsay Mendez as a trio of friends disillusioned after two decades amid the gutters and stars of Hollywood and Broadway. Friedman’s interpretation will probably be regarded as a gold standard. But even here, despite that indelible sour-sweet score, the gold is short a few carats. Some choices, it would seem, can’t be unmade, no matter how acute our hindsight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/dec/12/merrily-we-roll-along-review-daniel-radcliffe-jonathan-groff">Continue reading...</a>
