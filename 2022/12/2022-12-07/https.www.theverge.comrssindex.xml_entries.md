  <p id="NVtYmZ">Augmented reality isn’t really a thing yet. But you know what is? Face lenses. Millions of users across Snapchat, Instagram, Zoom, TikTok, and countless other apps are already used to tapping a button and having dog ears suddenly attached to their skull, rainbows fired out of their mouth, or their makeup subtly — or not so subtly — transformed into a new style. Most users don’t think of this as AR or view these features as evidence of some revolutionary new technology. But whether you call it lenses, filters, or something else, it’s all augmented reality.</p>
<p id="mB6wQ9">At its Lensfest developer event this week, Snap announced that it now has more than 300,000 developers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/17/17245008/snapchat-face-filter-creation-lens-studio-giphy-discover">building AR products</a> for its platform and that together, they’ve built more than 3...</p>

<p id="rLtwdh">The patent, which was independently located and verified by <em>The Verge</em>, could represent a new way to charge an electric vehicle’s battery through normal, everyday driving whenever things get bumpy — which, for a lot of us, is basically all of the time. </p>

  <p id="s4ZSLO">Microsoft says it has reached a 10-year agreement with Nintendo to make <em>Call of Duty</em> available on Nintendo consoles if the Activision Blizzard acquisition closes. The deal is similar in length to what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/5/23494886/microsoft-sony-10-year-call-of-duty-deal">Microsoft has offered Sony</a>, and the Xbox maker has also committed to continue to offer new versions of <em>Call of Duty</em> on Steam at the same time they launch on Xbox.</p>
<p id="VDMHUd">The deal is clearly designed to put pressure on Sony to accept a similar offer, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/5/23494886/microsoft-sony-10-year-call-of-duty-deal">just days after</a> Microsoft president Brad Smith said “Sony has emerged as the loudest objector” to Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch">proposed $68.7 billion acquisition</a> and that “it’s as excited about this deal as Blockbuster was about the rise of Netflix.”</p>

  <p id="lrPGwF">Apple plans to start using processors made in America following the opening of an advanced new chip factory in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
<p id="Iss3fa">For the plant’s customers, which also includes AMD and NVIDIA, the new facility means a more secure supply of chips and quicker production timelines. The chip fabricator, TSMC, also said today that it would start construction on a second factory in Phoenix next year, increasing the site’s annual output.</p>
<p id="V1NXIn">“These chips will power iPhones and MacBooks, as Tim Cook can attest,” President Joe Biden said at an event outside the Arizona factory on Tuesday. “Apple had to buy all the advanced chips from overseas. Now we’re going to do more of their supply chain here at home.”</p>
