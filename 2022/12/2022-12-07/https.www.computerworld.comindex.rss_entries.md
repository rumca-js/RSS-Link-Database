<p>Apple's global supply chain management strategy <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3682001/apple-iphones-and-china-short-term-problems-need-a-long-term-fix.html">appears to be shifting quickly to reduce its dependence on China</a> for iPhone and MacBook product assembly.</p><p>The move is part of a larger trend toward deglobalization, or reducing interdependence between business units distributed throughout the world, according to Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst with financial services firm TF International Securities.</p><p>Over the next three to five years, at least the for the US market, from 25% to 30% of global iPhone shipments can be supplied by assembly sites located outside of China to reduce potential impacts from political risks (such as US-China tariffs), Kuo wrote in <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1579852591147945986" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a tweet</a> last month.

<p>Apple’s iPhone production problems in China add yet another chapter to the collapse of previous supply chain models, ongoing political tension and exposure to disaster; all have underlined the need to diversify across every aspect of manufacturing to become more resilient.</p><h2><strong>Crisis management is no dawdle</strong></h2>
<p>The impact of these challenges on Apple means the company has perhaps lost millions of iPhone sales in the current quarter. That’s a challenge, but Apple is by no means unique in relying on a supply and manufacturing ecosystem that has proved less resilient than we need in these changing times.</p><p>Yes, for Apple, rioting workers in China is not a good look, and the attempt to keep COVID-19 in check there has evidently failed, to the probable detriment of us all. Surely, the current conflation of crises shows that the future of manufacturing must be multi-site and international.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3682001/apple-iphones-and-china-short-term-problems-need-a-long-term-fix.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>The US Congress is rolling back proposed legislation that would place restrictions on the use of Chinese-made chips by the government and its contractors, after  companies argued that the measures would raise costs.</p><p>While the draft legislation still provides for restrictions to be enacted, contractors now have five years to comply with them, rather than the two years stipulated in an earlier version of the proposal, and the language of the new draft leaves room for waivers to the restrictions under certain circumstances.</p><p>In September, Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, and Senator John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, announced a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal 2023 that would restrict federal agencies and contractors from using semiconductors and chips from China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp (YMTC), and ChangXin Memory 703 Technologies (CXMT).</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3682588/us-congress-rolls-back-proposal-to-restrict-use-of-chinese-chips.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
