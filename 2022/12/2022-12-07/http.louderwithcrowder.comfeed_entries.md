At least no one in America, the only country that matters. But don't take my word for it. Here is a resurfaced video of a babyfaced Dana White saying what a majority of Americans agree with.</p><p>Soccer sucks, and Dana doesn't care who knows it.

<blockquote>I can’t stand soccer. I think that it’s the least talented sport on Earth. There’s a reason three-year-olds can play soccer. You run around a kick a ball.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>White then gestured with his hands how big the net is, and how untalented you need to be to not be able to score when the net is that big.</p><p>The UFC president is more of a hockey guy.</p><blockquote>In hockey, you have guys on skates with crooked sticks where they have to hit a puck into a net that's the same size as the goalie. THAT's a sport that the score should be three to one.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>Dana White is all of us.</p><p>And while we are sharing universal truths, whoever invented youth soccer tournaments hate their parents so much they are taking it out on every other parent by making them waste entire weekends dragging the entire family to soccer tournaments. I'm fairly certain they invented dance recitals too and for the same reason.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">POLL: What’s worse as a parent?<br />— Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1600570403067412480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Thank you all for coming to my TEDtalk.</p><p><p>

## Mike Rowe finds WaPo's 'too many white men in Shark Week' so ridiculous, he is outsourcing his response to fans

Or, at the very least, has too many white men in it. This week, it's Shark Week. Both for its lack of diversity, and having too many white men named "Mike." Mike Rowe IS a white man named Mike who has hosted Shark Week in the past. Inquiring minds want to know... dafuq?</p><p>Here's the rub. White Mike Rowe is a busy man, and while he has been <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mike-rowe-fraud-troll" target="_blank">known to respond</a> to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mike-rowe-bullwark" target="_blank">silliness on occasion</a>, WaPo is so silly it's beneath him. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheRealMikeRowe/posts/pfbid02dNZdZL3g2FKwVFSzP8TPEhhfaqnNim8LBLWZyW8i1Yk4oZLRNTUCjCf2Xpdu2WY9l" target="_blank">So he is outsourcing his response to his fans</a>, and they delivered. </p><p>I'll set aside all the other White Mike's who were wondering where they could get some of this White Mike Privilege. Though one Mike is reveling in it: "I think I’m just gonna enjoy my 'Mike Privilege' for as long as it lasts. We are obviously trampling on all of the non-Mikes during Shark Week. Someone may be able to help me see my Mikeness."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="1317c" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32309610&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Helene claims "we’ve all seen how accurate 'scientists' can be, over the last few years." I'm detecting sarcasm but am not sure why. The Science has been nothing but accurate lately.</p><p>Frank thinks this goes much further than Shark Week: "The name 'Mike' is also overrepresented in the Hump Day Geico commercial."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="e1d89" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32309613&amp;width=980" />
</p><p><span></span>Jason applauds the stunning journalisming from WaPo: "I hope the WaPo is proud of this brave reporting. I cannot believe we as a society have had to contend with such an astonishing lack of diversity in Shark Week hosts. This is a serious issue that surely deserves attention at the highest levels."</p><p>Karol is curious about how someone becomes a “white expert." If this blogging and content hustling thing starts to dry up, I could probably be a white expert. I know all sorts of white peoples.</p><p>Finally, Gregory was quick to identify one non-White Mike associated with the week of many sharks: "So if they removed Mike Tyson as host...would that be considered a mic drop?"</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="edea7" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32309619&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Some stupidity is best just to ignore. It's like WaPo's news editor is a water tank full of manatees who push balls around to determine who gets assigned what topic to find some racist, sexist, homophobic angle to.</p><p>It's a week about sharks that makes people happy. Let people enjoy things.</p><p><p>

This is Canada, so instead of "Fauci Ouchie" we'll call it the "Trudeau Tip."</p><p>Authorities respond by finding more behavior and personal choices to mandate.

The government wants the daughter to put her dad on her app. Why? What's the point when they won't be traveling together? Meh. </p><p>This is why <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/freedom-convoy-couple-media-narrative" target="_blank">Canada had a Freedom Convoy</a>. And why Trudeau <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/justin-trudeau-emergencies-act" target="_blank">suspended civil liberties to crush the Freedom Convoy</a>.</p><blockquote>STOOGE: The government wants the app. What's the reason why you don't want to do it?<br />POUTINE PATTY: I don't think I should have to.<br />STOOGE: There has to be a reason though.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>This father and daughter did everything they were supposed to because they knew we're hashtag all in this together. They got all the Trudeau Tips, as mandated by the government. They wore face coverings, as mandated by the government. They provided proof of their shots, as mandated by the government. The government finds other things to mandate anyway. </p><p>When your low-information progressive niece with the blue hair doesn't understand why doing whatever your government tells you to do is such a big deal, this is why. Canada is why.</p><p><p>

No, not to clean up the crack and poop-littered streets of Pelosiville. They are going after Elon Musk for providing his employees with beds. Elon thinks the government should be focused more on the fentanyl that's killing babies. Ponder who you think is right as we take a trip.</p><p>San Francisco building inspectors are investigating Twitter over reports the company has converted empty office space into sleeping quarters. If employees are working overnight, Musk provides them with beds. Apparently "nap pods" are fine, but Twitter HQ isn't zoned for mattresses and potted plants.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">BREAKING: San Francisco building inspectors are launching an investigation into reports Twitter has converted several office rooms at its headquarters into sleeping quarters for employees.

He was less embarrassing then. </p><p>Now the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ted-cruz-howard-stern" target="_blank">corporate sellout</a> is such a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/howard-stern-mask-mandates" target="_blank">shill for the government narrative</a>, he is blaming Kirstie Alley's lack of supporting mandates for her catching colon cancer. Not being anti-schmaccine. Being anti-government forcing the schmaccine.</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/actress-kirstie-alley-kaitlan-collins" target="_blank">Kirstie Alley</a>, as most of you know, passed away this week after a brief battle with colon cancer. Here's how the fallen king of all media <a href="https://www.outkick.com/howard-stern-speculates-kirstie-alleys-anti-mandate-stance-caused-her-colon-cancer-death/" target="_blank">analyzed the sudden news</a>.</p><blockquote>I know she was an anti — she was not anti-[schmaccine], but she was anti-mandate. Maybe — this was a theory this morning cause we were all discussing it. Maybe she didn’t go to the doctor soon enough when she wasn’t feeling well? But that’s complete — a story made up by us. I mean, there’s no facts behind it.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>There are one of two things at play here, and I'll let you determine which is the less pathetic. The first is that Stern has decided being a hypochondriac corporate sellout shill for the government is his new schtick. And instead of getting people off while they straddle their speakers at home, his new way to "shock" is to get himself off with the most asinine ways to pledge his allegiance to the narrative.</p><p>Or, Stern's failed progressive-brain legit things opposing the federal government forcing your medical decisions means you're anti-doctors, anti-medicne, and anti-the science. </p><p>Kirstie Alley isn't the first person to die suddenly after discovering she had cancer. We lost both my godmother and my aunt this year two weeks after they were diagnosed. Alley is only the first celebrity to die suddenly of cancer after tweeting a few times that maybe, just maybe, government mandates are questionable. </p><p>Stern thinks the two are related. I think Stern is an idiot.</p><p><p>
