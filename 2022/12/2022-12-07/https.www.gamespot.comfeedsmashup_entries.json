But even by my relatively relaxed standards, the Chapter 4 Season 1 battle pass is a great one, without a bad skin in the bunch.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On top of that, this pass breaks us from the monotony of the past year of Disney/Marvel battle pass collaborations, going instead with a pair of much-anticipated Gaming Legends skins. And for the first time since Chapter 2 Season 6, we have a tier 100 skin that isn't a collaboration.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's not a perfect pass by any means--it could certainly use more diversity, for one thing, and it doesn't feel like either of the gaming collabs is quite as awesome as the Lara Croft outfit that also came with the Chapter 2 Season 6 pass (more on that later).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That said, this pass features eight outfits that are all worthy of spots in your regular rotation. But they can't all be the best. So let's look at which of Fortnite's Chapter 4 Season 1 battle pass skins are truly the best, in our oh-so-humble estimation.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Dusty</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4072706-chapter4battlepassdusty.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Dusty isn't a bad skin or anything like that, but if they're gonna put three separate punkish girls in a single battle pass, one of them is gonna have to come in last on a ranking of the outfits. It is what it is.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Nezumi</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4072705-chapter4battlepassnezumi.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>This season's anime character is admittedly pretty cool, and as a long-haired person I greatly appreciate it when we get skins sporting magnificent manes. The fact that you also get to decide how he does up his hair is also quite nice--Nezumi is the sort of outfit that doesn't look like much at first glance, but is greatly elevated by his robust customization options.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Helsie</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4072707-chapter4battlepasshelsie.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>A regular Fortnite person drawn in a late-90s/early-00s style? There's been a lot of that in this game this year (Bonejamin, Vivica Saint, Veronika, and everybody in the Boardwalk Warriors pack, to name a few), but Helsie is one of the better ones, with multiple styles that all follow the same template while still managing to be unique from each other.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Massai</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4072710-chapter4battlepassmassai.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>How many Native American characters have we had the chance to play as in Fortnite? Not many. But Massai, who is Apache, has an awesome set with possibly the best emote of the pass, and his masked style is actually dope enough to use in rotation--I'm not usually a fan of masked styles. He's got big Purge energy.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. The Doom Slayer</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4072704-chatper4battlepassdoomslayer.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The long-rumored \"Doom Guy\" skin is finally here, and his whole set is a delight, particularly the Cacodemon glider. But he feels like he really should have a retro style akin to the one Lara Croft got last year. So while he's very cool, he's not as cool as he could have been.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Selene</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4072709-chapter4battlepassselene.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Selene is top tier because she has two styles that are striking and quite dope for completely different reasons. The only bummer is that there's no transformation emote for it--both styles are good enough to be worth a preset slot.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. The Ageless</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4072708-chapter4battlepasstheageless.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>This season's transforming skin, and first tier 100 skin that wasn't a collab in a year and a half, is a snapshot of Fortnite's main antagonist, Geno, the founder of the Imagined Order. Both of these styles look great, even though I tend to get tripped up by the big shoulders on these knight-style outfits. And that transformation emote is pretty sick as well.</p><p>There's a reason all the Fortnite kids have been excited about this one since these styles first showed up in an outfit concept survey a while back, and the full 3D versions of the design look just as cool as they did as concept art.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Geralt of Rivia</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4072703-chatper4battlepassgeraltofrivia.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Since this is the so-called \"secret skin\" it's going to be a minute until we can get our Geralts and really appreciate just how awesome it has to be to have a Witcher skin in Fortnite. I'm definitely biased--I've beaten each Witcher game three times, even the turbo-janky original. And so for me, Geralt is the gaming collab I didn't know I wanted. And I am desperately, <em>desperately,</em> hyped about it.</p></h3></p><br />", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yuji-naka-arrested-again-over-insider-trading-allegations/1100-6509817/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Yuji Naka Arrested Again Over Insider Trading Allegations", "date_published": "2022-12-07 22:08:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Yuji Naka, co-creator of Sonic and director of the infamous Balan Wonderland, has been arrested again on alleged insider trading charges surrounding Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier.

It's a homecoming for the titular Dragonflights of Blizzard's long-running MMORPG, who return to their ancient ancestral home to pick up the pieces and rebuild after thousands of years away. It's also a homecoming for players, who after years of languishing in WoW's unpopular Shadowlands expansion, get to return to Azeroth and all the familiar sights and sounds it holds.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Dragonflight, in that regard, is incredibly nostalgic, but not in the way you might expect. Though it without a doubt features the return of fan-favorite characters, monsters, and even gameplay systems, it never feels beholden or shackled by them. Instead, it takes those familiar elements and breathes new life into them. Whether it's the return of talent trees reminiscent of those from the game's earliest expansions, the game's updated user interface, its lack of mandatory activities, or the feeling of adventure the new dragonriding system invokes, Dragonflight miraculously feels both fresh and familiar at the same time. Even if there are some aspects of Dragonflight that could be improved, I can't help but be impressed at how a handful of new ideas, along with major facelifts to some old ones, breathe new life into Blizzard's flagship title.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Dragons, as you might expect, are the star of this new expansion. Players ride new, highly customizable Dragon Isles Drakes. The majority of the main campaign's primary characters are dragons. There's even a new dragon race, the Dracthyr, that is only playable as the new dragon-themed spellcasting class, the Evoker. The Dragon Aspects Alexstrasza, Nozdormu, Wrathion, and Kalecgos all play key roles in the game's initial story campaign. To see them all front and center for the first real time since 2010's Cataclysm expansion is part of what makes Dragonflight feel so nostalgic, signaling a return to the high fantasy of Azeroth after nearly two years of the dark, dour, and death-themed settings and characters of Shadowlands.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-review-in-progress-who-says-you-cant-go-home/1900-6418011/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/rocket-league-season-9-rocket-pass-all-cosmetic-rewards/2900-4508/", "title": "Rocket League Season 9 Rocket Pass: All Cosmetic Rewards", "date_published": "2022-12-07 19:17:00+00:00", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1752/17528202/4073214-rls9title.jpg\" /><br /><em>Season 9's trailer gave players a short glimpse of the new Rocket Pass goodies.</em><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/rocket-league/\">Rocket League</a> Season 9 is now live, bringing with it all kinds of new cosmetic goodies to the game via the Season 9 Rocket Pass, which players first glimpsed when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glo4Fn0uXTA\">the Season 9 gameplay trailer</a> was released last week. But whether you prefer roasting chestnuts on an open fire or skiing down frigid slopes, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rocket-league-explodes-into-winter-with-season-9s-fire-and-ice-goodies/1100-6509636/\">this season's ice and fire theme</a>--and its corresponding Rocket Pass--is bound to be a major cosmetic crowd-pleaser.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Season 9's Rocket Pass has both a free and premium track. The Premium Rocket Pass is available for purchase at the cost of 1,000 Credits ($10 USD). But if you're in a hurry to get your hands on these new hot-and-cold Rocket Pass cosmetics, you may wish to purchase the Rocket Pass Premium Bundle for 2,000 Credits ($20 USD) instead. The Rocket Pass Premium Bundle instantly unlocks the standard Premium Rocket Pass track, but will also automatically boost you through the first 12 tiers of the Season 9 Rocket Pass.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The new Rocket Pass features 100 reward tiers, but not all rewards are cosmetic--many tiers reward players with XP boosts, in-game currency, and loot drops. Their precise are locations listed below:</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>XP boosts</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Players who purchase the Season 9 Rocket Pass will automatically gain a 50% XP boost. But continuing to advance though the reward tiers will net you additional stacking XP boosts.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">5% XP boosts can be found at tiers 10, 23, 32, 39, 50, 58, and 66. Additionally, a single 10% XP boost can be found at tier 4.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Credits</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Credits are used to purchase premium items--including everything from cosmetics to Rocket Passes--from the in-game store. You'll find bundles off 100 Credits at the following tiers: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 67, 80, 90, and 100.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Loot drops</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Loot drops, which unlock random cosmetics, are also available in the Rocket Pass. There are three kinds of loot drops:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Uncommon Drops are guaranteed to unlock one item of uncommon quality. They can be found at tiers 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Rare Drops are guaranteed to unlock one item of rare-tier quality. Rare Drops can be found at the following Rocket Pass tiers: 45, 50, 55, and 60.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Very Rare Drops are guaranteed to unlock one item of very-rare-tier quality. Very Rare Drops are located at tiers 65, 70, 80, 90, and 100.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Keep in mind that you don't actually need to purchase the Season 9 Rocket Pass to collect loot drops. All loot drops are located in the free Rocket Pass. As for the items you <em>will</em> need a Rocket Pass to obtain, take a look at the gallery below to peruse Season 9's icy-hot cosmetic offerings.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Rocket League Season 9 runs from December 7 to March 8.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1752/17528202/4073257-rocketleague%C2%AE_20221207134824.jpeg\" /></p><br />     <p><img

While Diablo III contrasted pops of bright colors against the grotesque horrors of the world, Diablo IV is immediately more oppressive and dire in its presentation. Its hues are muted and gray, its world uninviting and harsh, its stories seemingly primed to expose the worst parts of its characters. And yet, it doesn't seek to leave everything of its former entry behind. In many ways, this early slice of Diablo IV offered a good sense of how most of the mechanical changes introduced in Diablo III, and more recently Diablo Immortal, have been smartly iterated on to maintain exciting action with the satisfaction of flexible character construction.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The opening moments of the preview we had access to, which encapsulated just one of the five regions that make up Diablo IV's massive map, were surprisingly slow and measured. After escaping a deadly snowstorm and suffering haunting visions, my Sorceress wandered upon a tiny village in need of aid. The villagers were gracious to receive my help and pointed me towards some enemies to dispatch, which was a straightforward task with a potent frost-based starting spell making quick work of most enemies. Upon returning, I was treated to a short cutscene of celebration, the camera swooping down and close to each character to provide a more intimate view of the party. It didn't take long for the sinister underpinning of the soiree to reveal itself, however, with the villagers poisoning me and quickly attempting to offer me up as sacrifice for Lillith--the creator of Diablo's world, Sanctuary, and main antagonist for this fourth main entry in the series. Suffice it to say that my Sorceress managed to just escape death and exact some well-deserved revenge for the deception, setting the stage for the overall tone of the story to come.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Lillith didn't feature significantly in gameplay at all during my limited time with Diablo IV, which totaled around 10 hours, but her influence could be felt everywhere. Her appearance in Sanctuary has changed people; some have lost all sense of morality, seeking to appease this new god with blood sacrifices. Demons have emerged in other areas of the land, enforcing their own sins on humanity that lead to some gruesome side stories. One that stuck out occurred when a distressed villager asked me to help track down her missing husband, who was last seen heading towards the woods with another woman. A typical story of infidelity resolved in the husband in question being found maimed and dismembered, hanging between two rocks and being kept alive by his lust for a demon nearby. Despite slaying the demon and bringing about an end to the spell, the story had no happy ending. The grieving widow was left to question whether her husband's misgivings or the workings of a foul creature had ultimately left her alone, with no simple answer offered by my Sorceress. This theme seemed prevalent in this latest interpretation of Diablo's world, acting as a distinct departure from the far less dreary tone of its predecessor.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-hands-on-preview-redefining-hell/1100-6509761/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lotr-the-rings-of-power-adds-additional-new-cast-members-including-sandman-and-doctor-who-alumni/1100-6509795/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "LOTR: The Rings of Power Adds Additional New Cast Members Including Sandman And Doctor Who Alumni", "date_published": "2022-12-07 15:16:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Amazon Prime Video has announced an additional eight new recurring cast members for the forthcoming second season, currently in production in the UK.

Then there are those games that were scraped off the bottom of a barrel, and are associated with misery today. There's, unfortunately, no shortage of these games either, and while it would have been tempting to grab a dozen random titles from the Switch eShop this week, there are other better examples of straight-up bad video games.</p><p>Our list of 26 infamously bad games is organized in no particular order. Though some of these games are technically still available today, we don't recommend giving any of them a go--unless you are morbidly curious, of course. The list spans a wide number of genres and includes video games that became infamous in part due to their ties to major media properties (hello, Superman) as well as disappointing attempts to create new franchises or capitalize on the zeitgeist at the time of release.</p><p>If you'd prefer to read about games that don't come packaged with instant buyer's remorse, you can also check out our lists of the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-open-world-games-on-xbox-game-pass/2900-4253/\">best Xbox Game Pass open-world games</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-fps-games-on-xbox-game-pass/2900-4246/\">best FPS games</a>, and 10 <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/10-games-like-pokemon-that-fans-should-check-out/2900-4245/\">games like Pokemon</a> that fans should check out.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Superman 64</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4032009-superman64.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Video games featuring Superman--think Multiversus and Injustice--are regularly great, but solo Man of Steel games? Those titles are legendary for being more poisonous to the Man of Steel than a Kryptonite smoothie. Superman 64 set a bar so low for the DC Comics icon that people in Australia could use it to do pull-ups. Its opening level is a nightmare of almost-impossible obstacles, it's about as much fun as root canal treatment, and it features a control scheme that'll have you convinced that you're piloting a drunk whale.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Plumbers Don't Wear Ties</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4032025-plumbersdon%27twearties.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>It's 1993, and Panasonic's 3DO console is about to play host to a barely playable slideshow in the form of Plumbers Don't Wear Ties. Widely regarded as the video game equivalent of The Room, Plumbers Don't Wear Ties combines amateur hour acting, photography, and surreal <em>sensual</em> choices into a package that's about as erotic as doing your taxes.

It has rigs, and they are <em>big</em>. What the game doesn't tell you though is that said rigs exist in a world where the laws of physics feel like they were designed by a contestant on America's Next Jigsaw. Barely functional with its broken driving physics and an absurd level of bugs, the only memorable thing about this wreck of a game is an in-your-face screen proclaiming you to be the winner if you can make it to the finish line.</p><p>For more analysis into this absolute disaster, please watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB1zWEhgrLs\">GameSpot's Big Rigs review on YouTube</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bubsy 3D</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4032027-bubsy3d.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>You can try holy water, pipe bombs, or flamethrowers, but nothing in this reality seems capable of keeping Bubsy down. The Nickelback of video game franchises, Bubsy's worst hour came in the form of Bubsy 3D, a shift to the third dimension. As you'd expect, the 1996 game was terrible in every single way possible. Bubsy moved like he was swimming in syrup, the voice acting made you want to jam forks in your ears, and each level was a trial of endurance.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Quiet Man</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4032028-thequietman.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>If this game had quietly--pun fully intended--slipped under your radar, consider yourself lucky. The Quiet Man's tale of a deaf protagonist, mixture of live-action storytelling, and some brutal bone-breaking could have resulted in a hit game. Heck, it was even published by Square Enix and shown off at E3. But these parts combined into a messy and unsatisfying waste of money. Cutscenes outstay their welcome, there's a non-existent learning curve, and there's no rhyme or logic to the combat at all. A tragedy of wasted potential that's actually comedic when you realize how atrocious it really is, don't expect to see a sequel in the future.</p><p><em>Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-quiet-man-review-silence-is-not-golden/1900-6417030/\">The Quiet Man review</a>.</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Umbrella Corps</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4032029-umbrellacorps.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Imagine a Resident Evil game so terrible that it wasn't even associated with the franchise on its cover art.

In development for six years and looking like it was cobbled together in six days during a game jam gone tragically wrong, Ride to Hell combines cringe-worthy dialogue with shoddy level design, broken brawling, and sloppy driving to create a hat trick of motorcycle-themed misery.</p><p><em>Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ride-to-hell-retribution-review/1900-6411189/\">Ride to Hell: Retribution review</a>.</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Zelda CD-I games</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4032036-zeldacd-i.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>What went wrong with The Legend of Zelda games on the Philips CD-i, a console that was using groundbreaking CD-ROM technology at the time? <em>Plenty</em>. A shoestring budget and an absurd deadline are just two of the ingredients in this fail-pie, and it didn't help that the CD-i was a notoriously rubbish console as well. Expensive to own, half-baked with its design, and undeniably underpowered for the ambitious titles that it promised, Link: The Faces of Evil, Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon, and Zelda's Adventure created a Triforce of low quality with shoddy controls, frustrating combat, and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SMYgcS53Ezk\">animated FMV sequences</a> that you'll see in your nightmares.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4032037-tonyhawk%27sproskater5.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>After years of American Wastelands, Underground goofiness, and peripheral-based games, the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater franchise was ready to get back down to basics. Basically terrible, that is. Though it looked competent--even with a last-minute switch to cel-shaded visuals--and featured an all-star roster, this sequel was missing the magic that made the THPS special. Featuring more bugs than an unattended corpse and a generic approach to the THPS formula, the only real positive thing that anyone can say about THPS 5 is that it was thankfully and easily forgettable.</p><p><em>Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5-review/1900-6416265/\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 review</a>.</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Batman: Dark Tomorrow</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4032038-batmandarktomorrow.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Forget about Bane and his killer chiropractic arts, because this Batman game was broken beyond repair. Long before Rocksteady Studios was perfecting the superhero genre formula with its trilogy of Dark Knight adventures, developer Kemco was subjecting GameCube players to an experience that was as un-fun as could be. Batman played like a malfunctioning robot desperate to learn how to hug, the camera angles chosen were deadlier than Joker toxin, and unless you were psychic, you'd finish the game with a downer of an ending that was beyond your control.</p><p><em>Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/batman-dark-tomorrow-review/1900-6025392/\">Batman: Dark Tomorrow review</a>.</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Balan Wonderworld</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4032039-balanwonderworld.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>A colorful world, whimsical characters, and Sonic the Hedgehog creator Yuji Naka calling the shots should have made for a vibrant package, but Balan Wonderworld turned out to be a bigger waste of $60 than a sale on NFTs. It's baffling just how terrible the game is, as it cuts corners wherever it can, artificially pads out its runtime, and has a rotten foundation built on top of uninspired gameplay and clumsy controls. Naka himself was actually <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-co-creator-yuji-naka-blasts-square-enix-for-balan-wonderworlds-failure/1100-6502967/\">removed from his director position</a> six months before the game came out, with the final product being regarded as one of the worst games to ever bear a Sega logo.

While that's a guilty pleasure of a highlight, everything else about Rogue Warrior is a stinker. Its action is uninspired, levels are browner than a khaki pants warehouse, and the story is a war crime against originality, but at least the entire experience is <em>mercifully </em>short.

Reportedly developed with the idea of appealing to Western audiences at the time, Bomberman Act Zero didn't win any fans with its terrible camera angles, brutal lack of save-game features, and repetitive gameplay. There's even more to scrape off of the carcass of this forgettable take on Bomberman, with the most charitable description of this game being that it's apocalyptically awful.</p><p><em>Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bomberman-act-zero-review/1900-6157029/\">Bomberman: Act Zero review</a>.</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Final Fantasy XIV (the original version)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4032042-finalfantasyxiv.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Final Fantasy XIV of today is a redemption story, a testament to its developers going all in to save the MMORPG and managing to transform it into one of the gold standards of its genre today. But for a time, Final Fantasy XIV was a game that was notorious for its unstable servers, lack of story content, and no real incentives for any players who stuck it out. It was a flawed and broken game from the beginning, but Final Fantasy XIV's Realm Reborn redesign--led by director Naoki Yoshida--helped transform the game into the pinnacle of MMO fantasy adventures for the modern age.</p><p><em>Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-review-that-i-cant-deny/1900-6417806/\">Final Fantasy XIV review</a>.</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4032043-sonicthehedgehog.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>You could argue that there hasn't been a really good Sonic the Hedgehog game since the Genesis days, but Sonic '06 stands out because it's still bad by those standards. Not even Sonic could outrun launch-day bugs, a control scheme best described as weaponized nihilism, and camera angles that go the extra mile to frustrate you. There's a laundry list of other issues preventing you from having any fun whatsoever in this high-speed disaster, from dismal level design to loading screens that will physically age you, but at least the game's saving grace is that it has a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BWWfjK0v8eM?list=PLvNp0Boas723k0aBhOnIBp1cYAp8S89i7\">banger of a soundtrack</a>.</p><p><em>Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-review/1900-6162205/\">Sonic the Hedgehog review</a>.</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4032044-sonicboomriseoflyric.png\" /><br /><h3><p>You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see your brand turn out yet another stinker of a game. Rise of Lyric essentially stripped any speed or momentum from Sonic, forcing him to slow down and spend more time hammering away at simple enemies in an attempt to perhaps appeal to fans of Ratchet &amp; Clank or Jak and Daxter. The moment you shift into high gear, Rise of Lyric delights in throwing a technical roadblock your way by making you endure a journey of undeniably un-fun levels, aggravating characters, and polished misery.</p><p><em>Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-boom-rise-of-lyric-review/1900-6415956/\">Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric review</a>.</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ben-Hur</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4032045-ben-hur.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Remember the 2016 remake of Ben-Hur? Neither do I, but I do remember picking up the free promotional tie-in game and still feeling like I'd been cheated out of money. A mangled handful of colosseum chariot races that are generic and tedious, the Ben-Hur game is as forgettable as the film it was based on.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Yaris</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4032046-yaris.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>A video game tie-in to a very good Toyota hatchback, Yaris is the type of game that proves that proves that Skynet is real and just about everything in the world revolves around soulless commercialization. This freebie doesn't get anything right, and it probably actively dissuaded people from buying a Yaris. Its gameplay is the worst thing to happen to Toyota since the 2010 recall crisis and playing it makes you feel like a cop is about to pull you over for drunk driving.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Drake of the 99 Dragons</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4032047-drakeofthe99dragons.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Not to be confused with Sony's swashbuckling hero, Drake of the 99 Dragons put you in the cel-shaded trench coat of an assassin who had come back from the dead and was tasked with saving the world from nefarious forces. It's just a pity that with a cool setup like that, Drake had to battle awful camera angles, half-baked controls, and some of the blandest visuals of the day. Throw in laughably terrible combat sequences, and you've got the perfect recipe for a dead-on-arrival game.</p><p><em>Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/drake-of-the-99-dragons-review/1900-6084786/\">Drake of the 99 Dragons review</a>.</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Neverdead</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4032048-neverdead.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Neverdead is one of those rare bad games that you can't help but love. Its entire concept of an immortal bounty hunter cursed to fall apart quicker than the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail is hilarious, with dialogue that sounds like it was written by an edgy teenager. It's a game of frustrating lows and rare highs, and even though its ideas rarely match up with its unpredictable gameplay, Neverdead is a violent and disgusting oddity that you can't ignore when you see its absurdity in action.

That's it, just a green piece of cloth. What does this have to do with The Culling 2? Absolutely nothing, but it's infinitely more interesting than a battle royale which crashed and burned this badly. It had a catastrophic launch, to say the least. The barely populated servers were turned off about a week after they went live. An attempt to win back fans by returning to the drawing board failed to catch on, either. The Culling 2 is proof that even during the height of a craze--in this case, battle royales--it's easy to crash and burn.</p></h3></p><br />", "persistent": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-is-super-cheap-on-pc-for-a-limited-time/1100-6509792/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Horizon Zero Dawn Is Super Cheap On PC For A Limited Time", "date_published": "2022-12-07 14:54:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Guerrilla Game's Horizon series took a massive step forward this year with the launch of Horizon Forbidden West, but if you've been looking to see where the series began and you've got a PC that can handle it, then this deal on the first game will get you up to speed.

A gacha game at heart, the four-player focus and adjusted rules create fast and furious games where match momentum can shift in an instant, making the duel dynamic more exciting than ever.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/yu-gi-oh!-cross-duel\">Metascore: 73</a></p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Desta: The Memories Between</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4069689-destathememoriesbetween.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">A game that tackles surreal subject matters, Desta: The Memories Between puts a relatable spin on heavy topics such as death and loss.

It's a robust action-RPG that is easy to learn and fun to get a handle on, but its convoluted resource systems and overt efforts to squeeze some extra cash out of you does knock it several places down this list.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/disney-mirrorverse\">Metascore: 69</a> | Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/disney-mirrorverse-review-shattered-dreams/1900-6417901/\">Disney Mirrorverse review</a></p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Puzzle Quest 3</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4069691-puzzlequest3.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Match-three puzzle games can easily absorb hours of your time, but with so many titles available currently, it can be hard to stand out from the pack.

Leaning hard into its fantasy design and delivering a surprisingly engaging story, the latest entry in this series shines with slick gameplay and an easily accessible design.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/puzzle-quest-3\">Metascore: 69</a></p><p> </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Diablo Immortal</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4069692-diabloimmortal.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">It may have a controversial endgame and a few questionable microtransactions, but there's no denying that Diablo Immortal feels like a premium free-to-play game set in the deadly realm of Sanctuary. Not only a good-looking and feature-packed experience that has slowly been improving since launch, it plays superbly thanks to a delightful combat cadence that shines through each unique character class.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/diablo-immortal\">Metascore: 67</a> | Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-immortal-review-evil-on-the-go/1900-6417897/\">Diablo Immortal review</a></p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dislyte</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4069693-dislyte.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">When a gacha game gets its hooks into you, it can easily become a daily ritual as you find yourself engrossed with what's happening on your small screen.
