Welcome to my bonelab Retrospective; 69 days later I take another look at bonelab post the hype rosy glasses.. have my thoughts changed? Was it overhyped? How have the updates gone since launch? Does the campaign hold up as well as it's predecessor Boneworks? Today I answer all of those question and also talk about my own part in overhyping the game.. something that I have DEFINITELY learned a very hard lesson from. \n\nStill I find it pretty insane that you can play Bonelab and Boneworks levels on Quest 2- But basically, while mods are getting a lot better, there's still a LOT of work to be done on the SDK- luckily lots of great mods and fixes/ reworks to the campaign are working towards Bonelab being a much better and fuller game. \n\nHope you enjoyed! Was Bonelab overhyped for you? What were your thoughts?\n\n\nMy Links:\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/thrilluwu\nMy discord: \nhttps://discord.gg/2hCGM9BYez\nPatreon link:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Thrillseeker", "persistent": false}]
