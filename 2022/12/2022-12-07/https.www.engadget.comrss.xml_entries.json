It also says there are \"robust\" approval processes and controls for ByteDance workers who might access data outside the US.

While TikTok had a tentative agreement this summer, some officials are concerned the deal didn't go far enough to limit China's access.</p><p>The lawsuit's chances are uncertain. Potential access to data doesn't mean TikTok is being lax, and it's notable that apps like Facebook and Instagram are also rated 12+ despite the potential to see more adult-oriented material (Twitter is rated 17+).

For a spell, it kinda felt like Nintendo was the only name in town, but it\u2019s since become one of the more exciting corners of gaming. Today, there are handheld options for everything from <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-portable-pc-gaming-133008285.html\">AAA</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/playdate-review-indie-games-crank-170054294.html\">Indie</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-review-150056011.html\">retro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ayn-odin-review-203045715.html\">beyond</a>. Whatsmore, the current generation of mobile processors means we\u2019re seeing surprisingly capable hardware. The main problem, now, is that the software side of things hasn\u2019t quite caught up. There\u2019s perhaps no better demonstration of this than the Ayaneo Air Pro: a stellar example of what can be done, and what needs improving, in the burgeoning handheld PC world.</p><p>If you\u2019re not familiar with Ayaneo, that\u2019s understandable. The company hasn\u2019t been around all <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-world-s-first-7nm-handheld-gaming-device#/\">that long</a>, but it\u2019s already making a name for itself thanks to remarkably good hardware that brings PC gaming into the portable realm. If you imagine a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-review-small-hands-180026719.html\">Steam Deck</a>, but with Windows and a fraction of the size, you wouldn\u2019t be far off.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Before we dive into the gaming experience, the hardware itself is worth a closer look. The Air Pro is impressively well made. It has a similar footprint to Nintendo\u2019s Switch Lite, but it\u2019s thicker (.85 vs .55 inches) and heavier (.88lbs vs .55). In terms of build quality, honestly the Ayaneo feels far superior. The Hall effect analog sticks and triggers are smooth with a nice amount of travel. The D-pad is responsive and the buttons are the right kind of snappy. The centerpiece is the stunning 5.5-inch OLED display - a first on Windows gaming handheld Ayaneo is fond of reminding us. It\u2019s a delight to hold and feels premium in almost every regard. Even the fingerprint reader in the power button somehow adds a dash of sophistication.</p><figure><img alt=\"A close up of the left side of the Ayaneo Air Pro handheld gaming PC.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/c9277460-762f-11ed-b2c6-e46bd7dd5e15\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>As this is basically a PC, there are quite a few different configurations available. Some using AMD\u2019s 5560U chipset and others running the 5825U with assorted amounts of RAM and storage depending on your budget. And you will need a sizable budget as you\u2019ll soon find out.</p><p>The Air Pro doesn\u2019t quite have the grunt of Valve\u2019s venerable Steam Deck, but it does run Windows 11 out of the box and can run a surprising amount of high-end games in a more-than-playable fashion. And while the Steam Deck outguns it in terms of processing power, the Air Pro is legitimately portable without too much of a performance tradeoff.</p><p>Beyond size and the internals, the other main difference is price. Valve\u2019s handheld tops out at $650 for the 512GB version while the Air Pro <em>starts </em>at $699 (5560U/16GB RAM/512GB storage). You can bring that figure right up to $1,399 if you want the faster silicon, 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage - that\u2019s obviously quite spendy. The model we tested was somewhere between middle and top with the superior processor, 16GB of RAM and 1TB storage (though all models have expandable memory via a microSD card slot).</p><p>There are other gaming handhelds that run Windows, but many are too underpowered to handle a lot of bigger games. <a href=\"https://anbernic.com/products/new-anbernic-win600?variant=43308953108737\">Anbernic\u2019s Win600</a>, for example, runs on an older AMD Athlon Silver 3050e chipset with Radeon Vega 3 graphics. This is a significant step down, but then the Win600 only costs $375. Ayn\u2019s Odin can also run Windows, but the ARM-based version which brings with it some compatibility issues. GPD has been in this space for a while, but its <a href=\"https://gpd.hk/gpdwin3\">Win 3</a> is looking a little underpowered now (though its <a href=\"https://gpd.hk/gpdwin4\">Win 4</a> is coming this month and it looks suitably beefy).</p><p>Perhaps most tellingly there are <a href=\"https://www.ayntec.com/pages/loki-max\">many</a><a href=\"https://www.gpd.hk/gpdwin4\">more</a> handhelds in the <a href=\"https://aokzoestore.com/\">works</a> from companies like Ayn, the aforementioned GPD and others. There\u2019s even a <a href=\"https://ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-2.html\">new flagship</a> from the company itself, the <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-2-completely-different-amd-6800u-handheld#/\">Ayaneo 2</a>, that really should cause potential Steam Deck buyers some headaches. These un-released models all have something in common: AMD\u2019s 6800U chipset. It seems there was always an appetite for PC gaming on the go, just we didn\u2019t quite have the required hardware to run it. Until recently.</p><p>Technical limitations are one thing, but there\u2019s another more philosophical question that needs answering: Why make a pocketable PC when you can stream a lot of AAA games without the need for expensive, power hungry dedicated hardware? While it\u2019s true streaming is more viable than ever, that approach requires that you have a console or gaming PC in the first place or a subscription to something like GeForce Now or Xbox Cloud which isn\u2019t economically favorable for many folks (not to mention the libraries might not have what you want). Not to mention its dependence on a network connection - good luck with that on in-flight WiFi.</p><figure><img alt=\"A screenshot of Ayaspace, the game launcher Ayaneo uses on its Windows-based gaming handhelds.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/1410db70-7625-11ed-bfdd-95548c8ee6a2\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Which brings us back to the real issue: Windows isn\u2019t ready to be used on tiny screens and neither are many of the games that run on it. Ayaneo has tried hard to ameliorate this issue by adding its own launcher called Ayaspace. It serves as a front-end for all your games and manages to provide a vague console-like experience. But it\u2019s not long before the spell is broken and you find yourself using an analog stick as a mouse trying to log-in to Steam and then using a tiny onscreen keyboard to peck out your credentials.</p><p>Ayaneo has at least tried to solve some of these inevitable problems. The Air Pro, for example, has two buttons along the top (between LB and RB) that will pull up the onscreen keyboard, double for ESC and other essential Windows shortcuts to make navigating bearable. But you will likely need to plug in a mouse and keyboard at <em>some</em> point just to get something simple done.</p><p>It\u2019ll also soon become apparent that AAA games weren\u2019t necessarily made with a small screen in mind. For the most part, games look incredible on the Air Pro\u2019s OLED display. Even when playing games at 720p (the display is 1080p) they still look incredible - but it\u2019s often a necessary tradeoff for performance. You will likely find yourself wishing that display was <em>just</em> a little bit bigger. Not least to get rid of those bezels, but just for general quality of life.</p><p>Not least for games where there\u2019s a lot of text. Titles like <em>Disco Elysium</em>, for example, have a lot of written dialog -  and while it\u2019s easy enough to read for the most part, it\u2019s noticeably more fatiguing than if you were on a desktop. Thankfully, the display is sharp and the resolution is high enough that it\u2019s all still very legible, but there\u2019s  just that vague sense of a UI that wasn\u2019t built for a display of this size.</p><figure><img alt=\"Ayaneo Air Pro handheld gaming PC\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/00d61010-7630-11ed-afdf-c0875df28d42\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you\u2019re thinking \u201cWhy not just run SteamOS on it\u201d you wouldn\u2019t be alone.

The bigger issue might just come down to the practicality (millions of games available, wide hardware support) and reach of Windows. There are some more mundane challenges with SteamOS that don\u2019t make it a shoo-in replacement for these handhelds. Primarily, game compatibility. If it\u2019s not available on Steam, you can probably still install it on SteamOS but it might involve flipping to desktop mode or other workarounds which breaks the \u201cconsole\u201d experience you might have been seeking in the first place.</p><p>More importantly, some users are actually reporting <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/v23z1h/how_is_battery_life_on_windows/\">better battery life</a> with Windows on the Steam Deck despite expecting it to be worse. The claims are that it\u2019s broadly equivalent but in some cases even better than Valve\u2019s native operating system thanks to a combination of factors. PC gaming has a lot of variables, so this isn\u2019t necessarily that surprising. This isn\u2019t always going to be the case, but it\u2019s at least not a strong incentive for making SteamOS the go-to platform for portable PC gaming.</p><p>Battery life is especially important with a handheld and it would be a lie to say it\u2019s something that the Ayaneo Air Pro excels at. Or even does adequately at. Depending on what you\u2019re playing and the power drain - usually <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/tdp-thermal-design-power-definition,5764.html#:~:text=TDP%20stands%20for%20thermal%20design,basic%20indicator%20of%20power%20consumption.\">called TDP</a> \u2013 required for it to run satisfactorily. More demanding games will need a TDP of 12 Watts or above and you can hope for about an hour and 45 minutes battery life at this intensity. Some games can run just fine at 8W which will extend play time to around 2.3 hours. You can get over three hours of life on the lowest 5W setting but this won\u2019t be enough for anything but the lightest of games but it\u2019s good for general setup tasks and the like.</p><p>Needless to say, this isn\u2019t ideal for a handheld, especially as your battery pack likely won\u2019t cut it - unless it can deliver 65W, which most can\u2019t.</p><p>In short, the Ayaneo Air Pro represents a lot of hope and shines a light on some challenges. Hope in that true PC gaming on the go in a pocket-friendly format and on fantastic hardware, feels like it might finally be here. It\u2019s the challenges that are a little more complicated. Windows has a lot of advantages, but also plenty of practical drawbacks. Whether it\u2019s a case of adapting the hardware around these, or just a matter of a smart software overlay is being figured out in real time it seems.</p><figure><img alt=\"Ayaneo Air Pro handheld gaming PC\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/25f90d20-7630-11ed-adcb-2446600694bc\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Making a truly \u201cconsole\u201d experience will require some clever thinking and equally clever software. Ayaneo, for its part, is also working on its own Ayaneo OS that\u2019s Linux-based like SteamOS. Whether this will resolve some of the challenges remains to be seen, but it\u2019s clearly something that\u2019s being worked on. But that just accounts for one company. With other manufacturers with ties to Windows like GPD there\u2019s a risk of ending up with a mishmash of approaches.

Looking back at my time with <em>Diablo III</em> and, more recently, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/diablo-immortal-review-120001807.html\"><em>Diablo Immortal</em></a>, what stands out is that those games rarely, if ever, slow down to take a breath.</p><figure><img alt=\"A screenshot showing off one of Diablo IV's towns.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/022164b0-7644-11ed-bf7d-b1ff10d5c285\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Blizzard</div></figure><p><em>Diablo IV</em> feels different. It feels like a game that was designed by people who love the history of this franchise as much as I do. That might not seem like much, but it\u2019s refreshing when you consider <em>Diablo III\u2019s</em> original lead designer <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/diablo-iii-designer-sorry-for-insult-sort-of-sorry-for-5937105\">called his <em>Diablo II </em>predecessor a \u201closer.\u201d</a></p><p>\u201cCertainly, there are a lot of things about <em>Diablo II</em> that we think are really cool and need to be in <em>Diablo IV</em>, particularly when you look at the depth of systems and itemization\u2026 and, as you noted, there are things about <em>Diablo III</em> like the smooth and seamless combat that we wanted to bring forward to <em>Diablo IV,</em>\u201d game director Joe Shely tells me during a roundtable interview. Shely took over leadership of the <em>Diablo IV </em>team in the <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/22714695/diablo-4-new-game-director-blizzard-entertainment\">fall of 2021</a> after the game\u2019s previous director, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-loses-designers-121905544.html\">Luis Barriga</a>, left Blizzard when California\u2019s fair employment agency accused the studio of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-discrimination-abuse-video-163056567.html\">systemic gender discrimination and sexual harassment</a>. \u201cWe think <em>Diablo IV</em> can be a place that welcomes players from any previous Diablo game and people who have never played a Diablo game.\u201d</p><figure><img alt=\"A screenshot showing off one of Diablo IV's open-world environments. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/ccede5b0-7644-11ed-adda-2c85095def74\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Blizzard</div></figure><p><em>Diablo IV</em> existing as a project that takes all the best aspects of past entries in the series and iterates on them in meaningful ways is a theme Shely and his boss, Diablo franchise head <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/a353p4/gears-5-director-on-his-career-of-salvaging-game-development-trainwrecks\">Rod Fergusson</a>, repeat early and often. At first, I dismissed it as marketing, but after playing the game<em>&nbsp;</em>for about a dozen hours, I started to believe them.</p><p>Take combat, for instance. Carrying over a change Blizzard made for the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2013-06-13-diablo-3-for-consoles-may-be-different-but-its-still-diablo.html\">console release of <em>Diablo III</em></a>, each class comes with a dodge ability built into their kit. At first, you can only use your dodge once before it goes on cooldown, but as you level your character, you\u2019ll find magical and rare boots that give you additional charges.</p><p>The potion system, meanwhile, represents a hybrid of the systems that existed in <em>Diablo II</em> and <em>III</em>. When you first start playing, your character can carry a maximum of five potions on them. There\u2019s no cooldown after you use one, and you gain refills by slaying enemies or bringing a boss down to certain thresholds of their health. Walking over a potion when your character is at max health won\u2019t automatically heal you as it did in <em>Diablo III, </em>so there\u2019s more strategy involved. As you might have guessed, you can upgrade the potency of your potions and find ways to carry more as you progress through the game.</p><figure><img alt=\"A screenshot of the barbarian's skill tree, highlighting the rupture skill. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/526d6c70-7644-11ed-9f46-f74d9f15601a\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Blizzard</div></figure><p>On the surface, these are minor changes, but they add some much-needed tactical depth to Diablo\u2019s combat, so you\u2019re not just mindlessly clicking and spamming your skill rotation. Most larger enemies have a windup attack in their arsenal to stagger your character. Combine that with elite and champion variants of enemies that can use abilities like frost to trap you in place, and combat encounters feel more involved in <em>Diablo IV</em> than in past games. Playing on the game\u2019s veteran world tier difficulty, I had the most success when I used my barbarian\u2019s leap ability to close the distance quickly on ranged enemies and monsters like fallen shamans that could bring their comrades back from the dead.</p><p>All of that made for a fun and satisfying combat loop enhanced by how much the game encouraged me to experiment with my character\u2019s build. <em>Diablo IV </em>sees the return of <em>Diablo II</em>\u2019s<em>&nbsp;</em>skill trees, but this time around, you\u2019re not limited to respecing your character once per difficulty. Instead, you can at any time refund a single skill point or all of them simultaneously to tweak your build. At first, doing so only costs a few gold coins, but the price increases as you level your character. The beauty of this system is that you\u2019re free to experiment early before settling on the build that will take you through <em>Diablo IV\u2019s </em>endgame activities.</p><div id=\"a52a8190ef1c4b968f50c49701975b28\"></div><p>Unfortunately, I only had enough time to play through the demo with the barbarian. The preview also came with access to the rogue and sorcerer classes. At launch, the final game will feature five classes, adding the druid and necromancer to the mix.</p><p>I wish I could write about the story, but Blizzard asked those of us taking part in the preview not to spoil anything. What I can say is that once you complete <em>Diablo IV\u2019s</em> prologue, you can tackle its primary acts in any order you want. The preview build only came with access to act one and the Fractured Peaks zone where that part of the story takes place. When Blizzard revealed <em>Diablo IV</em> in 2019 by sharing the game\u2019s gruesome <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-01-blizzard-diablo-iv-cinematic-trailer-gameplay.html\">\u201cBy Three They Come\u201d intro cinematic</a>, I was worried the story would end up being edgy instead of mature and dark.</p><p>The little I\u2019ve seen of the plot has done a lot to address those concerns. Part of that has been thanks to the smart, restrained writing I saw and <em>Diablo IV\u2019s </em>willingness to give its narrative time to breathe, but the thing I think that\u2019s going to surprise a lot of people is how atmospheric <em>Diablo IV</em> can be in its best moments. All of the trailers Blizzard has released so far don\u2019t do nearly enough justice to all the great work the art team has done with the environmental, lighting and particle effects in the game. When my barbarian first began his adventure on a mountain beset by a blizzard, I reached for a blanket.</p><p>One thing the demo didn\u2019t include was a preview of <em>Diablo IV\u2019s</em> monetization system. Blizzard provided an overview of those this past summer. The short version is that the game won\u2019t include <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-reveals-diablo-iv-monetization-170021763.html\">pay-to-win microtransactions</a>. Instead, an in-game cosmetic shop will allow you to buy items you can use to customize the look of your characters further. Seasonal battle passes will allow you to earn additional cosmetics. From the moment you create your character, the customization systems are robust, offering you plenty of options to alter their physical appearance, including things like skin tone, head and facial hair, as well as jewelry.</p><figure><img alt=\"A screenshot showing one possible look for the barbarian class. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-12/ab7fda50-7644-11ed-baf8-25f7305e49fc\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Blizzard</div></figure><p>Additionally, the way you can modify the appearance of items is as fleshed out. For instance, if you use the transmog system to make a piece of armor look different, and then an item with better stats drops for you, you can match it with your previous set directly from the character sheet. By level 10, my barbarian had already started to look menacing.</p><p>If there\u2019s one worry I have about <em>Diablo IV, </em>it\u2019s the same one I\u2019ve had with every Blizzard game in the past decade or so: Can the studio stick the landing? To say Blizzard\u2019s recent output has been all over the place would be an understatement. I\u2019m still disappointed with how it handled remastering <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/warcraft-iii-reforged-not-the-flavor-of-chaos-we-were-hoping-for/\">my favorite RTS of all time</a>.

We've also found the Google Assistant to be a little more capable than Alexa at answering web queries.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>As a piece of hardware, the Nest Hub isn't blazingly fast, nor is its 1,024 x 600 resolution display especially sharp. Still, its built-in speakers and microphones do the job, and its soft fabric design should blend naturally into most rooms. Its 7-inch frame makes it a natural fit on a bedside table or bathroom counter, and while it lacks a built-in camera, that may be a good thing for those who want an added sense of privacy.

Chinese brand Tecno is now bringing such a feature to its latest flagship device, the Phantom X2 Pro 5G, which packs a &quot;world-first&quot; pop-out portrait lens. This is just a little over two years after Xiaomi <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-120mm-equivalent-retractable-phone-camera-macro-165051989.html\">showed off</a> a retractable 120mm-equivalent wide aperture lens, but it never left the prototype stage.</p><p>Tecno's intriguing portrait camera has a 50-megapixel resolution with a relatively large 1/2.7-inch sensor and 1.28um pixel size. Optically, this 2.5x zoom lens offers an f/1.49 aperture, 65mm focal length and 18.9cm depth of field. When you switch to portrait mode in the camera app, you can see (and hear) the portrait lens physically pop out on the back of the phone.

The 50-megapixel main shooter uses Samsung's 1/1.3-inch GNV ISOCELL 3.0 sensor, which offers 1.2um pixel size and is supported with an f/1.85 aperture. You'll also find a 13-megapixel ultra-wide angle camera nearby, as well as a 32-megapixel front camera on the other side of the phone \u2014 in the form of a punch-hole near the top of the curved 6.8-inch AMOLED screen (2,400 x 1,080 resolution, 120Hz refresh rate; Gorilla Glass Victus).</p><p>The Phantom X2 Pro 5G is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 9000, which is a 4nm octa-core processor \u2014 similar to the faster Dimensity 9000+ found in ASUS' <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-phone-6d-ultimate-pricing-availability-064809063.html\">ROG Phone 6D series</a>. It also packs 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage, along with a generous 5,160mAh battery with 45W fast charging support. While this phone lacks an IP rating, a company rep claimed that the retractable portrait lens is waterproof and dustproof \u2014 the interior of the lens is apparently sealed, and likewise with the connection between the lens and the body. Still, it's probably best to avoid the water when you're carrying this device.</p><p>Tecno's new phone runs on a customized Android 12 system dubbed HiOS 12, which features an AI gallery with face recognition and editing functions, along with some productivity tools (built-in translator, file scanner with text and PDF conversion etc.) and a connection speed optimization engine. Tecno added that its device passed T\u00dcV Rheinland's fluency test over a 36-month simulation, meaning its storage memory performance shouldn't deteriorate much (read: fragmentation) during the same period in real life; but we'll take this claim with a pinch of salt for now.</p><p>Tecno will initially be launching the Phantom X2 Pro 5G in markets including India, Nigeria, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, Colombia, Turkey, and the Philippines from the end of December, and it'll reach over 60 markets globally later (we're waiting for specific details on Western markets). The device will be available in &quot;Stardust Grey&quot; and &quot;Mars Orange,&quot; with the latter featuring an eco-friendly back cover composed of plastics recovered from the shores around the Indian Ocean. Tecno claims that this &quot;Eco-Friendly Edition&quot; reduces carbon emissions by approximately 38 percent when compared to virgin plastics, &quot;with each individual cover producing an estimated 2.4g fewer emissions on average.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>If you manage to come across a Phantom X2 Pro, the asking price is around $930 (based on the 3,499 Riyal price tag in Saudi Arabia), which is probably difficult to justify for <em>just</em> some natural bokeh. There's also the Phantom X2 which is around $215 cheaper and looks very similar, but it only has 8GB of RAM and lacks a retractable portrait camera; you'll instead get a 64-megapixel main camera and a 2-megapixel depth camera, along with the same 13-megapixel ultra-wide camera and 32-megapixel front camera as the Pro model.

Smith also said that Microsoft offered Sony, the loudest dissenting voice to the merger, a 10-year contract ensuring all new <em>CoD</em> releases would be available on the PlayStation the same day they go out for the Xbox. \"We're open to providing the same commitment to other platforms and making it legally enforceable by regulators in the US, UK and European Union,\" he wrote.
