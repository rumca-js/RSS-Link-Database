I wanted to share it here in case it comes in handy for someone else.<p>There are lots of competitors out there but I found them too ex

They said they would refund on Oct 17, but that date came and past. So I kept emailing.<p>Now they're saying they're holding all the fun

<p>Lately, I’ve just been trying to get by.<p>Feels like my body has been running on autopilot. The consequence of which life just seems to go by even faster. Losing the ability to relax and the feeling of self-control, over-indulging in endless feeds of videos, games and services that further drain the energy that I so crave to return. To a point where it feels more like an addiction, with my body now responding with physical discomforts and a relapse of anxiety that I have not felt for years.<

<p>I was diagnosed with MS 15 years ago, and was doing pretty well for a long time, but with the pandemic experienced a tremendous amount of stress that has left me with my first major flare-up since diagnosis and, more importantly, developing over the past 3 years, a feeling in my brain that feels like having been lobotomized, and symptoms like "mild" dementia. Difficulty multitasking, make silly mistakes, mentally tired easily, emotional issues, etc.<p>The MS was so far outside my concerns for

<p>The media has frequently been screaming about the dangers of one of the nuclear powerplants in Ukraine being targeted and damaged in the war.<p>A dirty nuke, radiation over Europe the scenarios being discussed are plentiful.<p>To me this seems to be the best argument to not invest and rely on nuclear powerplants going forward.<p>Ukraine has several other types of power generators / plants that are not featured much in the media. The exception being hydropower when a dam was damaged.<p>The arg
