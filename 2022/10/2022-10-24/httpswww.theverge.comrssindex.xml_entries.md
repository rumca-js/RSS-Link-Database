It’s <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Growth/Feature_summary">adding features designed</a> to ease users into making their own edits, including suggestions for easy first steps like cross-linking different articles.

Not to mention the pet hair that the fabric is going to attract or what it will look like after being carried from room to room by grubby little four-year-old hands.</p>

<p id="vT4k0K">Battery life estimates for the Ultra can be a little tough to parse. The official line is that the watch lasts up to 36 hours with normal use and up to 12 hours during an outdoor run. However, Apple also introduced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23403065/apple-watch-low-power-battery-how-to">Low Power Mode</a> in watchOS 9 that limits or disables certain features to last enough to finish an Ironman race — roughly 14-15 hours.

  <p id="uCzOzh">Henry Cavill is letting people know that he’s not done playing Superman (<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/superman-henry-cavill-back-black-adam-1235185234/">via <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>). In an Instagram post on Monday, he posted a promotional image of himself as the superhero, along with a video where he says, “I am back as Superman.” His announcement comes after he made a cameo appearance in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/20/23414415/black-adam-review-dwayne-johnson-the-rock"><em>Black Adam</em></a>, DC’s latest movie, and as we’re <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dc-movies-james-gunn-pithces-dwayne-johnson-1235243030/">starting to hear reports</a> that a sequel to 2013’s <em>Man of Steel</em> is in the works. </p>
<p id="CM8sfJ">In his video, Cavill calls the image and his appearance in Black Adam “just a very small taste of what’s to come.” The caption also references “the dawn of hope renewed” and says that people’s patience will be rewarded.</p>

  <p id="3CAbxI">Like any novel technological development, text-to-image AI models are slowly moving from the R&amp;D stage to the phase of “making weird stuff for social media.” </p>
<p id="jicR74">Case in point is the phenomenon of the AI-generated selfie, which splices your likeness with different artistic styles and themes using machine learning. Think of it like the next Snapchat filter: a quick way to make your face look goofier than normal. Or goofy in a different way. </p>
<p id="aoB3K9">There are a few methods to make your own AI-generated portrait right now, like the free web tool <a href="https://drawanyone.com/">DrawAnyone</a>. Just head to the site and upload some selfies, let the system process your likeness, and then pick an output style for your new portrait. A fair warning: you’ll probably have to wait a few hours...</p>

  <p id="84AMVO">I’ve always wanted a skeleton key — not a real one, but the kind you would see in a cartoon that opens any door immediately. The idea of just being able to slip in anywhere, smoothly and discreetly, has always been a secret dream for me.</p>
<p id="irzT5c">Of course, time changes and so do keys. Your front door might still use a metal key, but offices and industrial facilities are more likely to use some kind of wireless keycard, whether it’s NFC, RFID, or some other radio signal. So what does a tappable skeleton key look like?</p>

<p id="Xv6jcI">The Angry Miao Adjustable Flex Alice (AM AFA) is the company’s first Alice layout keyboard (a newer ergonomic style with contoured keys, a gap in the middle, and a split space bar).

  <p id="X87rfj">In a new memoir, U2 frontman Bono has spilled the beans on the internal discussions that lead to two of the band’s high-profile collaborations with Apple. The first saw the band star in one of the company’s iconic iPod ads, while the second is much less fondly remembered, and involved Apple pushing the band’s newly released album into the hands of everyone with an iTunes account. The anecdotes appear in Bono’s upcoming book, <em>Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story</em>, extracts of which have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/22/bono-memoir-birth-of-u2-itunes-album-live-aid-mullet">published by <em>The Guardian</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="iTtEBB">According to Bono, the Vertigo music video came about after members of the band met with then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs in October 2004 to pitch its upcoming song “Vertigo” as the soundtrack to one of the iPod’s silhouette commercials....</p>
