According to the leak, Amazon Prime subscribers will be able to claim seven games in November, including Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition, WRC 9, and Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade. Considering that this leak came from Dealabs poster billbil-kun--the person behind the always-accurate PlayStation Plus freebie leaks--it seems likely that the list is correct. We expect for Prime Gaming to make an official announcement covering November's lineup later this week. Here's the full list of games posted to Dealabs:</p><h2>Leaked Prime Gaming free games for November 2022</h2><ul><li>Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition</li><li>WRC 9 FIA World Rally Championship</li><li>Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade</li><li>Last Day of June</li><li>Etherborn</li><li>Whispering Willows</li><li>Facility 47</li></ul><p>The standout in terms of name recognition is obviously <strong>Fallout: New Vegas</strong>. The beloved RPG developed by Obsidian Entertainment originally released in 2010 for consoles and PC. New Vegas improved on the gameplay systems presented in Fallout 3 and offered a wider mission variety. With a huge open world and a huge collection of sidequests, New Vegas was engaging even after completing the main campaign. Though it might understandably feel dated today, New Vegas is still well worth checking out for the first time or revisiting. The Ultimate Edition includes a bunch of bonus content, too, so you could wind up sinking north of 100 hours into New Vegas.</p><p><strong>WRC 9</strong> isn't the newest game in the rally racing franchise, but for any racing fans who haven't played this series before, it could be a great opportunity to give it a try. WRC features authentic off-road racing mechanics, plenty of cars and courses, and numerous solo and multiplayer game modes.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-free-games-for-november-2022-have-apparently-leaked/1100-6508583/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/early-black-friday-deal-get-an-lg-4k-oled-tv-for-only-570/1100-6508573/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Early Black Friday Deal: Get An LG 4K OLED TV For Only $570", "date_published": "2022-10-24 19:33:00+00:00", "description": "<p>If you\u2019re in the market for a new TV, Black Friday is the time to shop.

With <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/black-panther-wakanda-forever-trailer-breakdown/2900-4365/\">Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</a> just around the corner to close the books on Phase 4, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is looming over the horizon to start the new phase off in style. And we just got our first official trailer for the new movie, to give us an idea of what to expect.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Now, there are some things we already knew about this one from casting announcements and so on. Jonathan Majors (Lovecraft Country) signed on to play Kang the Conqueror several years ago, and actually made his MCU debut as a variant of Kang back in the Loki Season 1 finale. As He Who Remains, Majors warned Loki and Sylvie of the dangers of killing him and unleashing countless variants of himself, each worse than the last. Naturally, this is exactly what happens\u2013but we have yet to get any real idea of what that means for the rest of the MCU. Since the last episode, there has been no mention of He Who Remains, Kang, or all the multiversal chaos that Loki and Sylvie may have caused.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And, critically, there's nothing in the Quantumania trailer to connect or nod to the events of Loki just yet, so how these two separate events are going to dovetail into one another is anyone's guess.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">What the Quantumania trailer does have, however, is plenty of weird-looking aliens, Scott Lang gags, and even a cameo from an I Think You Should Leave fave.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Let's break down the biggest moments from the trailer\u2013and don't forget to let us know your favorite theories in the comments below.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Humble beginnings</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4053489-01.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>It's easy to forget that Scott kicked off his time in the MCU by working at Baskin Robbins\u2013which, sure, is definitely just some creative product placement on Disney's part, but it's also paying off a great running gag. After everything Scott's been through, he's finally earned the coveted employee of the century position (which is definitely real), after being fired back in Ant-Man.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Celebrity</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4053490-02.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>We've seen little bits and pieces of Scott's celebrity life in other MCU projects, but here we see him actually walking a red carpet. Not quite sure what it's for\u2013maybe something to do with his budding career as a writer/autobiographer?</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>If the steering wheel flies off, Scott's toast</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4053491-03.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Perhaps the most critical Easter egg in any MCU project ever, the cafe owner is none other than Ruben Rabasa of I Think You Should Leave fame. He thinks Scott is Spider-Man, which is an honest mistake.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Cassie's invention</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4053492-04.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>We've literally watched Cassie Lang grow up through the MCU, and now she's inventing (obviously dangerous) things! Look how far she's come! Now she's played by Kathryn Newton.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Quantum Danger</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4053493-05.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Naturally, things go awry very quickly\u2013which Janet anticipates just a moment too late. Remember Jan spent a considerable amount of time lost in the Quantum Realm before she was rescued back in Ant-Man and the Wasp, so presumably she'll be able to help out once they're all stuck. However, Scott also spent some time stuck there\u2013remember that's how he escaped the Snap, so we might learn something about that time, too.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Quantum Residents</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4053494-06.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>It's extremely difficult to get a good look at any of the weird Quantum Realm creatures featured in the trailer, and they've all been doubtlessly given the MCU redesign treatment so recognizing them off the cuff isn't likely\u2013however, there is a non-zero chance that we're gearing up for an MCU debut for a group like the Micronauts, an extremely obscure toy-spin-off team that uh, well. They're small and they live in another dimension, what more do you want? (Perhaps more realistically they're Anachronauts, which are different but just as silly\u2013don't worry too much about it yet.)</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Jan's got secrets</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4053495-07.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>It sounds like we're going to get a deep dive into what Jan was up to during her Quantum Realm stay\u2013and our bet is that it's going to have something to do with Kang.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Chronopolis</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4053496-08.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Chronopolis is the (somewhat on the nose) home of Kang in the comics\u2013and we actually thought it had been revealed back at the finale of Loki, but the city here in this trailer is probably a much closer fit.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Hey Bill</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4053497-09.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">We've known for a while that Bill Murray will be making his MCU debut in Quantumania and here he is! We still have no idea who he's playing or what his relationship to Jan actually is, though.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Cassie in costume</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4053498-10.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Cassie gets her own Ant-Man flavored super suit at some point, and we get a brief glimpse of her wearing it here. In the comics, Cassie is a size-shifting hero named Stature, but we're not sure if she's going to adopt that name in the MCU or not.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Kang</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4053499-11.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Jonathan Majors first appeared in the MCU back in Loki as \"He Who Remains,\" a variant of Kang the Conqueror\u2013and now we see him here as Kang himself. In a voice over, it sounds like Kang is pitching Scott on a team-up that will help Scott get back home and \"give him more time,\" which sounds a little ominous. Also, it's worth noting that because of the way the Quantum Realm works and the whole variant situation, there's absolutely no way to be certain that the other glimpses of Kang we saw in the trailer are all the same person. There could be multiple Kang incarnations running around in this movie, just to make things more complicated.</p></h3></p><br />", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cult-of-the-lamb-halloween-event-introduces-a-new-ritual-and-new-follower-forms/1100-6508571/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Cult Of The Lamb Halloween Event Introduces A New Ritual And New Follower Forms", "date_published": "2022-10-24 18:31:00+00:00", "description": "<p>In the Blood Moon Festival, Cult of the Lamb's new Halloween event, players can summon the ghosts of the dead and thereby earn new followers and decorations.</p><p>The event starts today, October 24, and lasts until November 10.

Rose has unique powers at her disposal that make her feel distinct from the many other protagonists in Resident Evil's long history, but it's the shift to a third-person perspective--along with changes in pacing, style, and tone--that set Shadows of Rose apart from Village's main campaign. It's more comparable to the recent Resident Evil remakes than either of Ethan Winters' misadventures, but for as much as I adore those games, I'm hopeful this switch isn't indicative of the series' future.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Shadows of Rose begins with the discovery that Rose's powers have blighted her formative years. The narrative is light on details regarding how her powers manifest, but sweating a white substance is enough reason for spiteful classmates to mercilessly bully her for being \"different.\" Rose just wants to be a normal kid and rid herself of these debilitating abilities, so when she's offered the chance to find a cure she jumps at it with little hesitation. However, attaining said cure requires her to enter the consciousness of the Megamycete. This fungal root is not only responsible for the Mold and Rose's powers, but any humans who made physical contact with it have had their memories absorbed and stored within. This conceit allows for some fun surprises and also lets Capcom revisit iconic locations from Village's story, albeit with a few key differences.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The first locale you're dropped back into is Castle Dimitrescu. The resident Lady of the house is absent this time around, but the castle walls are now inhabited by a villainous version of Ethan's merchant ally, The Duke, who gleefully dispatches his own creatures to snuff Rose out. These grotesque monstrosities are similar in design to the Molded from Resident Evil 7, except they have a nasty habit of sucking Rose's face off whenever they get ahold of her. To combat these Face Eaters, Rose is aided by an unseen entity called Michael who can only communicate by conjuring written words that appear floating in mid-air and on various surfaces. Michael manifests a pistol early on, and he'll provide you with ammunition and healing items from time to time, as well as providing hints on where to go next. His presence is more crucial to the story than the moment-to-moment gameplay, but the floating words add a fun wrinkle to chase scenes as it feels like you're being guided by an omniscient being.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-village-winters-expansion-review-this-rose-doesnt-bloom/1900-6417988/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-of-thrones-definitely-fell-off-at-the-end-maisie-williams-says/1100-6508565/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Game Of Thrones \"Definitely Fell Off\" At The End, Maisie Williams Says", "date_published": "2022-10-24 18:13:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Game of Thrones actor Maisie Williams, who played Arya Stark on the hit HBO fantasy show, has joined the chorus of those who believe the series didn't end on the strongest footing.</p><p>During a <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/talfuin/clip/SwissCourteousBurritoTakeNRG-hVnpYsy4s4jbiBmp\">Twitch stream</a> (<a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/maisie-williams-game-of-thrones-final-season-1235412440/\">via Variety</a>), Williams said she recently re-watched the show and acknowledged that while the series started strong, it \"definitely fell off at the end.\"</p><p>That's all Williams had to say about the end of the show, but she isn't the first among the cast to broach the subject of how the series ended.

We thought, 'This is great, we're going to foreshadow it, we're going to explore it,' and along the way, we had some crazy ideas that we developed, some got thrown out, some got put on the back-burner, and everything else is what you're going to be seeing very soon.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-15-new-map-explores-bright-side-of-broken-moon-contrasts-heaven-and-hell/1100-6508537/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-is-getting-free-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-upgrades-in-2023/1100-6508551/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Fallout 4 Is Getting Free PS5 And Xbox Series X|S Upgrades In 2023", "date_published": "2022-10-24 14:56:00+00:00", "description": "<p>As part of its Fallout series celebrations, Bethesda has announced that Fallout 4 will be getting a current-gen update for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, as well as several bug fixes and bonus Creation Club content.</p><p>Similar to several modern games such as <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-has-a-great-graphical-mode-for-both-resolution-and-performance/1100-6508509/\">God of War: Ragnarok</a>, players will be able to choose between a performance mode for high frame rates or a quality mode that prioritizes 4K resolution gameplay. <a href=\"https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/jfwd8PsUw8r3pKrO1wOc5/fallout25-conclusion-interviews-events-perks\">Bethesda didn't mention</a> more than that, but the studio did say that the update will be free and arrives in 2023.</p><p>If Fallout 4 adopts an approach similar to other games on the market, it's likely that the performance mode will favor 60fps with a dynamic scaling resolution, while the quality mode could lock the game to 4K and 30fps.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-is-getting-free-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-upgrades-in-2023/1100-6508551/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uncharted-appears-to-be-sonys-weakest-pc-launch-yet/1100-6508552/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Uncharted Appears To Be Sony's Weakest PC Launch Yet", "date_published": "2022-10-24 14:52:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Sony has found some success porting its older exclusives to PC in recent years, but its latest one seemingly has not sold as well as previous games.
