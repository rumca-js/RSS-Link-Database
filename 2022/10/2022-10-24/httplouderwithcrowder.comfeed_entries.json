He <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/alec-baldwin-abc-interview\" target=\"_blank\">cried about it while claiming he has no guilt for killing her</a>. Then, he <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/alec-baldwin-blames\" target=\"_blank\">blamed HER for it</a>. All while offending the Hutchins family every step of the way. Widower Matt Hutchins <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/alec-baldwin-rust-widower\" target=\"_blank\">told the <em>Today Show</em></a>:</p><blockquote>I was just so angry to see him talk about her death so publicly in such a detailed way and then to not accept any responsibility after having just described killing her. Almost sounds like he was the victim, hearing him blame Halyna in the interview and shift responsibility to others, and seeing him cry about it. I just feel like, 'Are we really supposed to feel bad about you, Mr. Baldwin?</blockquote><p>Judging by Baldwin's Instagram post marking the occasion, yes. Yes, you are supposed to feel bad for him. He's having a tough go of it. Accidentally shooting and killing a woman shouldn't happen to anyone.

Joe! Joe!\" Then he signed the bill into law. Even though, there was no bill for him to sign into law.</p><p>The other option is another senior moment where Joe Biden, in his brain, isn't lying as much as he legit thinks this all happened. Critics have said <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-book-dementia\" target=\"_blank\">Biden suffers from dementia</a>.
