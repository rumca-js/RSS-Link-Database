<p>Days before Elon Musk’s deal to acquire Twitter could finally close, workers at the social company are warning that staff cuts would be “reckless.” <em>Time</em><a href="https://time.com/6224380/elon-musk-twitter-open-letter/">reports</a> that an open letter from an unspecified number of Twitter employees, directed to Musk and Twitter’s board, is making rounds within the company.</p><p>The letter comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-reportedly-wants-to-lay-off-most-of-twitters-employees-222504933.html"><ins>a report </ins></a>from <em>The Washington Post</em>, that Musk wants to cut as much as 75 percent of Twitter’s roughly 7,500 staff. “Elon Musk’s plan to lay off 75% of Twitter workers will hurt Twitter’s ability to serve the public conversation,” the letter says. “A threat of this magnitude is reckless, undermines our users’ and customers’ trust in our platform, and is a transparent act of worker intimidation. We cannot do our work in an environment of constant harassment and threats.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The letter also includes a list of demands for “current and future leadership” of the company. In addition to “fair severance policies for all workers,” letter writers want Musk to keep existing employee benefits in place, including remote work. Musk has previously criticized remote work, and suggested most Twitter employees should <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/16/tech/elon-musk-twitter-employee-meeting/index.html"><ins>return</ins></a> to the office.</p><p>The letter also hints at the potential ideological divide between some Twitter workers and Musk, who has said he favors <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-ted-181607962.html"><ins>less moderation</ins></a>. “We demand that leadership does not discriminate against workers on the basis of their race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, or political beliefs,” the letter says.</p><p>It’s unclear how many workers have signed onto the letter so far. But it’s yet another sign of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-elon-musk-takeover-all-hands-010014379.html"><ins>how messy</ins></a> things could get for Twitter employees under Musk. After a months-long legal battle, the deal seems to be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-21/twitter-musk-talks-warm-up-as-buyout-closing-deadline-nears"><ins>on track</ins></a> to close by the October 28th <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-twitter-v-elon-musk-trial-is-on-hold-until-october-28th-222615330.html"><ins>deadline</ins></a>.</p>

## ‘Fallout 4’ is getting high-FPS and 4K upgrades on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC

<p><em>Fallout 5</em> is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bethesda-fallout-6-2032-maybe-221507088.html">nowhere near release</a>, but Bethesda might have something to tide you over. <em>VGC</em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fallout-4-is-getting-a-free-upgrade-for-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/">reports</a> the game developer has <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/jfwd8PsUw8r3pKrO1wOc5/fallout25-conclusion-interviews-events-perks">unveiled</a> plans to release a "next-gen" (really, current-gen) update for PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC in 2023. The upgrade will offer high frame rate and 4K quality features, and include new (if currently unspecified) Creation Club content.</p><p>This isn't the first time Bethesda has spruced up visuals for <em>Fallout 4</em>. An update for the Xbox One X enabled 4K in the 2015-era title, but only at 30 frames per second. The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fallout-4-other-bethesda-games-fps-boost-xbox-203044566.html">took advantage of FPS Boost</a> on Xbox Series X and S to deliver 60FPS gameplay last year, but apparently capped the resolution at 1080p. While it's not clear exactly what improvements you'll see this time around, it won't be surprising if there are fewer compromises.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The strategy is familiar, at least. As with CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IuRzJRrRpQ"><em>The Witcher 3</em> patch</a>, it's an effort to sustain interest in an old game while work continues on a long-awaited sequel. No, this likely won't spur sales, but it might keep <em>Fallout 4</em> in players' minds (and to a degree, <em>Fallout 76</em>) until there's a new release. If nothing else, it's another way to mark the series' 25th anniversary.</p>

<p>Since 2019, Bumble has used machine learning to protect its users from lewd photos.

It was primarily designed to catch unsolicited nude photos, but can also flag shirtless selfies and images of guns – both of which aren’t allowed on Bumble. When there’s a positive match, the app will blur the offending image, allowing you to decide if you want to view it, block it or report the person who sent it to you.</p><p>In a <a href="https://bumble.com/en/the-buzz/bumble-open-source-private-detector-ai-cyberflashing-dick-pics"><ins>recent blog post</ins></a>, Bumble announced it was open-sourcing Private Detector, making the framework available on <a href="https://github.com/bumble-tech/private-detector"><ins>Github</ins></a>. “It’s our hope that the feature will be adopted by the wider tech community as we work in tandem to make the internet a safer place,” the company said, in the process acknowledging that it’s only one of many players in the online dating market.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unwanted sexual advances are a frequent reality for many women both online and in the real world.

## YouTube Music contractors vote to unionize

<p>A group of workers at YouTube Music Content Operations, an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/alphabet/"><ins>Alphabet</ins></a> subcontractor, have filed with the National Labor Relations Board for union recognition and bargaining power after a supermajority of the 58-strong group signed union cards. "As a part of the YouTube Music Content Operations team, workers ensure music content is available and approved for YouTube’s 2.1 billion monthly active users worldwide," the Alphabet Workers Union-Communications Workers of America (AWU-CWA) said in a statement.</p><p>The workers, who are based in Austin Texas, were already paying AWU-CWA dues and are now seeking bargaining rights. The AWU-CWA says those rights would force Alphabet to recognize the union as the workers' bargaining unit. The NLRB has <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/16-RC-305751"><ins>scheduled a hearing</ins></a> for November 14th. The union, which was formed in January 2021, now counts nearly 1,200 Alphabet workers as members, including full-time employees as well as temporary, vendor and contract workers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The AWU-CWA says it "won't stop organizing until all Alphabet workers (full-time, temporary, vendor and contract workers) have dignity on the job, the pay and benefits we deserve, and a seat at the table." Earlier this year, a group of Google Fiber workers in Kansas City <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-fiber-unio-vote-cwa-192732483.html"><ins>voted to unionize</ins></a> with the AWU-CWA. This month, the AWU <a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-union-council-bluffs-contract-workers-fired-1849627671"><ins>filed complaints</ins></a> with the NLRB, accusing the company of firing Google data center workers in retaliation for union activity. The union says Google fired two workers who attempted to discuss pay and working conditions.</p><p>“We are honored to welcome the workers of the YouTube Music Content Operations team as members of the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA," Google software engineer and AWU-CWA executive chair Parul Koul said. "Google platforms like YouTube have largely been a success thanks to the labor and efforts of the thousands of contract workers that ensure quality content while being denied their fair share. We’re excited to see these workers bring Alphabet to the bargaining table and use their power to win the quality pay, benefits and rights on the job they deserve.”</p><p>Engadget has contacted Google for comment.</p>

## Justice Department alleges Chinese spies tried to disrupt a criminal investigation into Huawei

<p>Two spies from the People's Republic of China attempted to interfere in a criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice into a prominent Chinese telecommunications company, US Attorney General Merrick Garland announced on Wednesday. The two agents, Guochun He and Zheng Wang, were working for the benefit of Huawei, reports <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-24/chinese-spies-tried-to-obstruct-probe-of-a-telecom-us-alleges?leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a complaint seen by the outlet, He and Wang attempted to bribe a law enforcement official to provide them with information on the Justice Department's investigation. The two began cultivating a relationship with the employee, who is not named in the lawsuit, in 2017. They allegedly sought to obtain details about witnesses, evidence and possible additional charges that could be filed against Huawei. He and Wang kept paying the employee for more information not knowing that they were working with an FBI double agent. The two are accused of obstructing the Justice Department's prosecution against Huawei. It's unclear if they have been arrested.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>"This was an egregious attempt by PRC intelligence officers to shield a PRC-based company from accountability, and to undermine the integrity of our judicial system," said US Attorney General Merrick Garland. "The Justice Department will not tolerate attempts by any foreign power to undermine the rule of law upon which our democracy is based. We will continue to fiercely, protect the rights guaranteed to everyone in our country."</p><p><em>Developing...</em></p>

<p>Apple is matching its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macos-venture-ipados-16-ios-161-updates-170844000.html">wave of software updates</a> with a not-so-pleasant price hike. As <em>9to5Mac</em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/10/24/apple-music-tv-prices-going-up/">reports</a>, the company has raised the prices of Apple Music and Apple TV+. Music now costs $11 per month for individual plans (up from $10) in the US, or $109 per year. The Family plan now costs $17 per month instead of $15. TV+ sees the largest relative jump — the price has increased from $5 per month to $7, and from $50 per year to $69.</p><p>Accordingly, Apple has hiked prices for its multi-service One bundles. You now pay $17 per month for an Individual plan versus the earlier $15. Family users now pay $23 per month instead of $20, and Premier customers pay $33 per month where they previously paid $30.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A company spokesperson attributes the increases to licensing costs in a statement to <em>9to5</em>. The more expensive plans will let artists and writers "earn more" from streaming music, Apple claims. The TV+ increase also reflects the size of the service, the representative adds. The video offering had "just a few shows and movies" when it launched three years ago, and now has a much larger catalog.</p><p>This won't thrill you if you're cross-shopping services. Spotify still asks $10 per month for its regular plan, and $16 for a six-user family account. You won't get lossless or spatial audio, but it's a better bargain if you're more interested in the lowest possible price. Things are murkier with video services. The higher pricing still makes Apple TV+ more affordable than Amazon Prime Video and ad-free Netflix (particularly if you want 4K HDR), and more specialized services like Disney+ and Hulu will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-price-increase-ad-based-service-204903273.html">charge extra</a> in December. It's just a question of whether or not shows like <em>Ted Lasso</em> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/slow-horses-apple-tv-plus-160047710.html"><em>Slow Horses</em></a> are worth the outlay.</p><p>The larger One prices may be easier to swallow. It's difficult to find all-in-one bundles that combine music, video, cloud storage and other services, particularly if you want something Apple-friendly. And like it or not, you probably won't find alternatives that include <a href="https://www.engadget.com/echelon-connect-sport-exercise-bike-with-apple-fitness-plus-irl-150025282.html">fitness apps</a> or magazine subscriptions.</p>

<p>It's a major <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple/">Apple</a> update day, as the company is rolling out new versions of its iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems. While iPhone users at large have already had a taste of iOS 16, this will be the first time that most folks will get their hands on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-os-16-macos-ventura-october-24th-162257225.html">iPadOS 16 and macOS Ventura</a>.</p><p>Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipados-16-release-date-delay-182206624.html">delayed the release</a> of iPadOS 16 amid reports <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipados-16-delay-report-185313488.html">suggesting</a> it needed more time to polish up the Stage Manager multitasking feature (which we <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-os-16-public-beta-preview-193037237.html">felt was unrefined</a> in an early iPadOS 16 beta). In fact, Apple said it was skipping a public release of iPadOS 16 and going straight to version 16.1 — just in time for the company's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2022-preview-m2-chip-130006105.html">latest iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-2022-refresh-preview-130006762.html">entry-level iPad</a> shipping this week.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/10/ipados-16-is-available-today/">latest version</a> of the iPad operating system will include many of the same updates as iOS 16, including significant changes to Mail, Safari, Messages and other key apps.

During <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macos-ventura-preview-stage-manager-173031552.html">our hands-on with the beta</a>, we felt that the feature improved the multitasking experience on Mac. The Continuity Camera feature, which offers a native way to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-continuity-webcam-iphone-mac-facetime-184540330.html">use your iPhone as a Mac webcam</a>, sounds intriguing, as does the introduction of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wwdc-safari-redesign-extensions-mac-ios-ipados-tab-groups-184210596.html">shared tab groups</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-passkeys-offer-even-better-protection-for-you-passwords-190334447.html">passkeys</a> to Safari.&nbsp;</p><p>More accessibility options are always welcome too. With macOS Ventura, Apple is adding Live Captions for all audio content, a Type to Speak function for calls, a Text Checker proofreading tool for those who use the VoiceOver screen reader and other tools. Meanwhile, it's worth noting that the System Preferences menu is now called System Settings, and it has a redesign to align it more with iPhone and iPad settings.</p><p>As for iOS 16.1, that offers shared photo libraries through iCloud and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/clean-energy-charging-feature-iphone-ios-16-170238058.html">clean energy charging function</a>, which optimizes iPhone charging times depending on when the power grid is using greener energy sources. Apple Fitness+ is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fitness-plus-iphone-release-date-144013544.html">now available on iPhone</a> without the need for an Apple Watch. Also new are an improved battery life icon, third=party app support in Live Activities and per-app copy-and-paste permissions, which should mitigate <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-16-copy-and-paste-prompt-fix-131559755.html">iOS 16's irritating paste prompts</a>.</p>

<p>Put horror movies and games aside for a few minutes to listen to something truly unsettling this Halloween season. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/european%20space%20agency/"><ins>European Space Agency</ins></a> has released audio of what our planet's magnetic field sounds like. While it protects us from cosmic radiation and charged particles from solar winds, it turns out that the magnetic field has an unnerving rumble.</p><p>You can't exactly point a microphone at the sky and hear the magnetic field (nor can we see it). Scientists from the Technical University of Denmark <a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/FutureEO/Swarm/The_scary_sound_of_Earth_s_magnetic_field"><ins>converted data</ins></a> collected by the ESA's three Swarm satellites into sound, representing both the magnetic field and a solar storm.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="99521838011045169d467390e93b0c46"><div style="width: 100%; height: 400px;"></div></div><p>The ethereal audio reminds me of wooden wind chimes rattling as a mass of land shifts, perhaps during an earthquake. It brings to mind the cracking sounds of a moving glacier as well. You might get something different out of the five-minute clip.</p><p>“The team used data from ESA’s Swarm satellites, as well as other sources, and used these magnetic signals to manipulate and control a sonic representation of the core field. The project has certainly been a rewarding exercise in bringing art and science together," the university's Klaus Nielsen, a musician and supporter of the project, said. “The rumbling of Earth’s magnetic field is accompanied by a representation of a geomagnetic storm that resulted from a solar flare on November 3rd, 2011, and indeed it sounds pretty scary."</p><p>If you happen to visit Solbjerg Square in Copenhagen this week, you may be able to immerse yourself in the magnetic field's low rumble. More than 30 loudspeakers are pointed at the ground there. They'll broadcast the audio three times daily until October 30th. “We have set it up so that each speaker represents a different location on Earth and demonstrates how our magnetic field has fluctuated over the last 100,000 years," Nielsen said.</p><p>This isn't the first time researchers have turned data from otherwise silent forces into sound. Last year, NASA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jupiter-moon-ganymede-sounds-juno-probe-163306580.html"><ins>released an audio representation</ins></a> of magnetic field activity around Jupiter's moon Ganymede.

<p>For digital artists, doodlers, and heavy note takers, we think Apple's own second-generation Pencil is, unsurprisingly, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ipad-accessories-130018595.html#applepencil">the best iPad stylus</a> money can buy. The one major hang-up with the device has been that it's wildly expensive, but if you've been looking to pick one up, a deal going on today alleviates that concern at least somewhat.

There's no Bluetooth pairing process to worry about, and notably both devices offer pressure sensitivity across iPadOS, so the harder you press down, the heavier the line you're drawing gets. Various third-party styluses support the latter in specific apps, but the Pencils have the benefit of offering it system-wide. This latest model was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-30-apple-pencil-wireless-charging-ipad-auto-pairing.html">released in 2018</a> but, while it's possible Apple could announce an updated version in the near future, we haven't heard much to suggest a refresh is imminent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both Pencils perform reliably and accurately, but between the two, the second-gen Pencil remains a fairly noticeable upgrade. Instead of charging through a Lightning port—<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQLU3AM/A/usb-c-to-apple-pencil-adapter">or a dongle</a>, if you own a USB-C-based iPad—and awkwardly jutting out the side of your tablet, it attaches magnetically to a newer iPad's right side. In addition to providing a more natural place to rest, this connection charges the Pencil, so battery life should never be a concern unless you plan on drawing for 12 hours straight. The newer model also has a useful double-tap feature that lets you quickly toggle between settings in certain apps; in Apple's Notes app, for instance, you can double-tap to switch from your drawing tool to an eraser. The flatter edges of the second-gen Pencil are less conducive to rolling off a table than the rounded design of the first-gen model, too.</p><p>The other knock against the Pencil is that it's only compatible with iPads, and each generation only works with specific models at that. For the second-gen Pencil on sale here, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211029">those models include</a> the fourth-gen iPad Air and up, the third-gen 12.9-inch iPad Pro and up, any 11-inch iPad Pro, and the sixth-gen iPad mini. All other iPads, including the entry-level 10.2-inch iPad or the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-2022-refresh-preview-130006762.html">just-announced 10th-gen iPad</a>, aren't supported.

## PayPal adds passkey support in the US for easier logins and check outs

<p>PayPal has started rolling out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-passkeys-offer-even-better-protection-for-you-passwords-190334447.html">passkeys</a> for users in the US, on the same day Apple is bringing the technology to its computers and tablets with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-os-16-macos-ventura-october-24th-162257225.html">macOS Ventura and iPadOS16</a>. That means you'll be able to log into your PayPal account without having to type in your credentials, which in turn makes its quicker to check out your online shopping carts. PayPal says the option will first be available to users with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-16-now-avaialble-170942309.html">iPhones</a>, iPads and those visiting its website on Macs, but it will expand to additional platforms as they add support for the technology. Google released <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-passkey-support-android-chrome-164017230.html">initial passkey support</a> for Android and Chrome earlier this month and will launch the stable version, as well as an API for native Android apps, later this year. PayPal will also make passkeys available in other countries starting in early 2023.</p><p>Passkeys use your biometrics to log into your accounts, but it's different from using your face or or fingerprints to auto-populate username and password boxes. With passkeys, you become the login. When you activate the option for an app, it creates a cryptographic key pair associated with your account. One of those keys is public, and that's what apps and services save to confirm your identity. The other key is private and is only stored on your devices, so hackers can't steal them if they ever get into the servers of apps you use. Apps and websites that support passkey then match the public key they have with your private key to make sure that it's you who's logging in.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can switch the feature on by logging into your account with a browser on desktop or mobile — the old way, with your user ID and password — and then choosing "Create a passkey." After you authenticate using Apple Face ID or Touch ID, your passkey will be automatically generated. And since passkeys are synced with iCloud Keychain, you only need to do that once. If you're logging into your account on another device that doesn't have passkey yet, you'll have the option to generate a QR code after entering your user ID. You can then scan that QR code with an iPhone that does support passkey to be able to log in.</p>

## YouTube adds pinch-to-zoom on mobile as part of its latest redesign

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/youtube/"><ins>YouTube</ins></a> is getting a fresh look and some extra features. For one thing, you'll be able to pinch to zoom into a video on the iOS and Android apps. When you remove your fingers, the video will stay zoomed in. That seems like a handy option for everyone who's about to pore over Taylor Swift's new videos to look for Easter eggs. YouTube started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-tube-testing-pinch-to-zoom-feature-for-premium-users-120414529.html"><ins>testing the pinch-to-zoom feature</ins></a> with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-tube-premium-family-plan-now-costs-23-a-month-222050334.html"><ins>Premium users</ins></a> in August, and now it will be available to everyone.</p><p>Another feature should help you get to the right part of a video more easily. On desktop and mobile, you'll be able to drag your cursor up or swipe up while scrubbing through a video to view a row of thumbnails (a bit like you might see on Netflix). As YouTube suggests, this should help you avoid rewinding too far back while you're watching a tutorial and want to rewatch a step.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="YouTube ambient mode" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/817c58c0-53a6-11ed-bf6a-3a9f98defcee" style="height: 797; width: 891;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">YouTube</div></figure><p>On the visual front, there's a new ambient mode that tweaks the background color of the app to match the video. YouTube UX director Nate Koechley describes this <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-look-and-feel-for-youtube/"><ins>in a blog post</ins></a> as a subtle effect that takes advantage of dynamic color sampling, with the aim of drawing users' eyes into videos and placing more focus on the content.&nbsp;</p><p>Ambient mode will also be available on video playlists. You'll see ambient mode on web and mobile watch pages when you have the dark theme enabled. On that note, dark mode will soon look even darker on the web, mobile and smart TVs.</p><figure><img alt="YouTube ambient mode for playlists " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/9822d6d0-53a6-11ed-b2f7-ffb4be1640c1" style="height: 782; width: 900;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">YouTube</div></figure><p>Elsewhere, YouTube links in video descriptions will now be displayed as buttons. The service has reworked common actions such as like, share and download to "minimize distractions" too. Moreover, the subscribe button will have a new look — it will be a pill-shaped button instead of a rectangular one. Although the button will no longer be red, YouTube suggests the high-contrast redesign will help it stand out more on watch pages and channel pages.</p><p>YouTube is starting to roll out these changes today. They should be live for everyone within the next few weeks.</p>

## The best budget robot vacuums for 2022

<p>We all could use a little help keeping our homes clean, and now we live in an age where robots are actually capable of lending a (mechanical) hand. Robot vacuums are some of the most ubiquitous smart home gadgets available today with their circular shapes and propensity for bumping into walls. While they provide an undeniable convenience, they can also be expensive. It’s not unheard of to drop close to $1,000 on a high-end robot vacuum cleaner.</p><p>But in a change from just a few years ago, today there are now plenty of budget robot vacuum options to choose from. At Engadget, we consider anything under $300 to be cheap in this space and you may be surprised to see how many there are at that price point. And if you’re new to the world of robot vacuums, you may find that one of these budget gadgets does everything you expected and more, without sacrificing cleaning performance.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Engadget's picks</h2><ul><li><p>Best overall: <a href="https://amzn.to/3tijYtJ">iRobot Roomba 694</a></p></li><li><p>Runner up: <a href="https://goto.target.com/0JOjvV">Shark Ion RV765</a></p></li><li><p>Best bang for your buck: <a href="https://amzn.to/3BEvF1z">Anker Eufy RoboVac 11S</a></p></li></ul><h2>Are robot vacuums worth it?</h2><p>Friends and family often ask me if new gadgets are “worth it,” and when it comes to robot vacuums the answer is yes. The most important thing they have going for them is autonomy: Just turn it on, walk away. If you’re someone who wants to spend as little time as possible cleaning your home — or just someone who detests vacuuming — a semi-autonomous robotic vacuum is a great investment.</p><p>There are plenty of other good things about them, but before we dive in let’s consider the biggest trade-offs: less power, less capacity and less flexibility. Those first two go hand in hand; robot vacuums are much smaller than upright vacuums, which leads to less powerful suction. They also hold less dirt because their built-in bins are a fraction of the size of a standard vacuum canister or bag. And while robo-vacs are cord-free, that means they are slaves to their batteries and will require regular recharging.</p><p>When it comes to flexibility, robot vacuums do things differently than standard ones. You can control some with your smartphone, set cleaning schedules and more, but robo-vacs are primarily tasked with cleaning floors. On the flip side, their upright counterparts can come with various attachments that let you clean couches, stairs, light fixtures and other hard-to-reach places.</p><h2>What to look for in a budget robot vacuum</h2><figure><img alt="Shark RV761 robot vacuum" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/003b50b0-7aa2-11eb-aff5-816aabf68e15" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>When looking for the best budget robot vacuum, one of the first things you should consider is WiFi connectivity. While you may think that’s a given on all smart home devices, it’s not. Some of the most affordable modes don’t have the option to connect to your home WiFi network. If you choose a robot vac like this, you won’t be able to control it with a smartphone app or with voice commands. Another feature that’s typically reserved for WiFi-connected robots is scheduling because most of them use a mobile app to set cleaning schedules.</p><p>But WiFi-incapable vacuums usually come with remote controls that have all the basic functions that companion mobile apps do, including start, stop and return to dock. And if you’re concerned about the possibility of hacking, a robot vac with no access to your WiFi network is the best option.</p><p>You should also think about the floors in your home. Do you have mostly carpet, tile, laminate, hardwood? Carpets demand vacuums with more suction power that can collect debris that gets pushed down into nooks and crannies. Unfortunately, there isn’t a universal metric by which suction is measured. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger. But other companies don’t rely on Pa levels and simply say their robots have X-times more suction power than other robot vacuums.</p><p>So how can you ensure you’re getting a robot vacuum that will adequately clean your floor type? Read the product description. Look for details about its ability to clean bare floors and carpets, and see if it has a “max” mode you can use to increase suction. If you are given a Pa measurement, look for around 2000Pa if you have mostly carpeted floors.</p><p>Size is also important for two reasons: clearance and dirt storage. Check the specs for the robot’s height to see if it can get underneath the furniture you have in your home. Most robo-vacs won’t be able to clean under a couch (unless it’s a very tall, very strange couch), but some can get under entryway tables, nightstands and the like. As for dirt storage, look out for the milliliter capacity of the robot’s dustbin — the bigger the capacity, the more dirt the vacuum cleaner can collect before you have to empty it.</p><p>Object detection and cliff sensors are other key features to look out for. The former helps the robot vacuum navigate around furniture while it cleans, rather than mindlessly pushing its way into it. Meanwhile, cliff sensors prevent robot vacuums from tumbling down the stairs, making them the best vacuum for multi-level homes.</p><h2>Best overall: iRobot Roomba 694</h2><figure><img alt="iRobot Roomba 694" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8d2ea5e0-7aa1-11eb-9fbf-39d8ed2bf920" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>Both iRobot and Shark impressed with their affordable robo-vacs. But we think <a href="https://amzn.to/3tijYtJ">iRobot’s Roomba 694</a> will be the best budget robot vacuum cleaner for most people thanks to its good cleaning power and easy-to-use mobile app. The Roomba 694 replaced the Roomba 675 last year but, aside from an updated exterior, it’s fundamentally the same vacuum. It looks much sleeker now with its new all-black design, giving it an aesthetic similar to some of the more expensive Roomba models. It has three physical buttons on it — start, dock and spot — and  it connects to WiFi so you can control it via the iRobot app. Unfortunately, your $274 gets you the vacuum and its necessary parts only so you’ll have to pay up immediately when you need a replacement filter or brushes.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3tijYtJ" id="0321d58721f04bb2a1e6e4019f1e0eae">Buy Roomba 694 at Amazon - $274</a><p>Setting up the Roomba 694 is straightforward: Open the companion app and follow the instructions. Once it’s connected to your home WiFi network, you’re able to use the app to control the vacuum whenever you don’t feel like using the physical buttons. However, the spot-clean function is only available as a button, which is a bit of a bummer.</p><p>iRobot’s app is one of the biggest selling points for any Roomba. It’s so easy to use that even someone with no prior experience will be able to quickly master the robot’s basic functions. iRobot’s app puts most pertinent controls on the homepage, so you rarely (if ever) need to navigate through its menu to do things like set a cleaning schedule.</p><p>We recommend setting cleaning schedules to really get the most out of the device. After all, these are semi-autonomous robots, so why not make it so you rarely have to interact with them? Doing so will ensure the Roomba runs through your home on a regular basis, so you’re always left with clean floors. The Roomba 694 in particular did a good job sucking up dirt and debris on my carpets as well as the tile flooring in my kitchen and bathrooms. The only thing I try to do before a cleaning job is get charging cables off of the floor – the Roomba will stop if it sucks something like that up and it’s relatively easy to extract a cable from the machine’s brushes, but I’d rather not have to do so if I can avoid it.</p><p>When it comes to battery life, the Roomba 694 ran for around 45 minutes before needing to dock and recharge. iRobot says run times will vary based on floor surfaces, but the 694 is estimated to have a 90-minute battery life when cleaning hard floors. While 45 minutes may be enough time for the robot to scuttle around most rooms in my apartment, those with larger homes may have to wait for it to recharge in order to clean everywhere.</p><p>iRobot has made a name for itself in the autonomous vacuum market for good reason. Its machines are polished, dead simple to use and the accompanying app is excellent. That ease of use (and the reputation of the iRobot name) comes with a slightly higher asking price, which many will be willing to pay. But there are plenty of solid options now that didn’t exist even just three years ago.</p><h2>Runner up: Shark Ion RV765</h2><figure><img alt="Shark Ion RV765" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-03/4749f220-9fdd-11ec-bfef-452375985009" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Shark</div></figure><p>The <a href="https://goto.target.com/0JOjvV">Shark RV765</a> is the updated version of the RV761 that we previously recommended. Like the Roomba 694, the Shark RV765 has a slightly different design and a longer run time than the RV761, but otherwise they’re the same vacuum. You can still find the <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Ygon7R">RV761</a>, but it’s a little difficult to do so now that the latest model is available. Although we haven’t tested the RV765, we feel comfortable recommending it since we found the previous version to be a great affordable robot vacuum.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://goto.target.com/0JOjvV" id="69f6d5f47cf9467295c342d36d0f590a">Buy Shark RV765 at Target - $250</a><p>One thing that the RV765 fixes about the previous version is the latter’s ugly bowling-shirt design. The new model nixes that and opts for a sleeker, all-black look with three buttons for docking, cleaning and max mode. You could rely just on the buttons, but it also connects to WiFi so you can use the Shark Clean app. As for the longer run time, that’s just a bonus. The RV761 ran for about 90 minutes before needing to recharge, which was plenty of time for it to clean my two-bedroom apartment. The additional 30 minutes of battery life on the RV765 should allow it to clean larger spaces more efficiently.</p><p>Some other things we liked about the RV761 include its spot-clean feature; adjustable wheels, which raise and lower automatically depending on the “terrain” and the obstacles in its path; and its intuitive companion app that allows you to start and stop cleaning jobs, set schedules and more.</p><h2>Best bang for your buck: Anker Eufy RoboVac 11S</h2><figure><img alt="Anker Eufy Robovac 11S" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/a5ea2140-7aa1-11eb-b6b7-740b955f347b" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>Anker’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3BEvF1z">$230 Eufy RoboVac 11S</a> was one of the cheapest vacuums I tested but it also proved to be one of the most versatile. First thing to note: This robot vacuum doesn’t have WiFi, but it does come with a remote that gives you most of the functions and smart features you’d find in an app (including a schedule feature). Eufy also includes additional brushes and filters in the box.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3BEvF1z" id="9b60e3d18a8a4845a7c6726b518c0a46">Buy Eufy RoboVac 11S at Amazon - $230</a><p>The “S” in this robot’s name stands for slim, and it’s roughly half an inch thinner than all of the other vacuums I tested. Not only does this make the 11S lighter, but it was the only one that could clean under my entryway table. The 11S has a physical on-off toggle on its underside plus one button on its top that you can press to start a cleaning. It always begins in auto mode, which optimizes the cleaning process as it putters around your home, but you can use the remote to select a specific cleaning mode like spot and edge clean.</p><p>The 11S has three power modes — Standard, BoostIQ and Max — and I kept mine on BoostIQ most of the time. It provided enough suction to adequately clean my carpeted floors, missing only a few crumbs or pieces of debris in corners or tight spaces around furniture. It ran for roughly one hour and 15 minutes when in BoostIQ mode and it has remarkable collision avoidance. Sure, it bumped into walls and some large pieces of furniture, but it was the only budget vac I tried that consistently avoided my cat’s play tunnel that lives in the middle of our living room floor.</p><p>As far as noise levels go, you can definitely hear the difference between BoostIQ and Max, but none of the three settings is offensively loud. In fact, I could barely hear the 11S when it was on the opposite end of my apartment running in BoostIQ mode. Thankfully, error alert beeps were loud enough to let me know when something went awry, like the 11S accidentally getting tripped up by a rogue charging cable (which only happened a couple of times and neither robot nor cable were harmed in the process).</p><p>Overall, the Eufy RoboVac 11S impressed me with its smarts, despite its lack of WiFi. The lack of wireless connectivity is arguably the worst thing about the robot and that’s saying a lot. It’s worth mentioning that this model is rated for up to 1300Pa suction, but you can grab the next model up, the RoboVac 11S Max, which gives you 2000Pa suction (just know that it’ll likely be louder as a result). But you can’t argue with the value of the $230 11S — especially when you can often find it on sale for $160 or less.</p><p>At this point, though, the 11S is a few years old, so you could grab either the Robovac G20 or G30 if you want something comparable but a bit newer. Both come in hybrid versions, which means you’ll get a robot vacuum and mop in one. The differences between the G20 and G30 series are minor, and we recommend getting the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09LHBZ6KB/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=buyersguide2022-20&amp;language=en_US">$300 G20 Hybrid</a> if you’re just looking for a Eufy machine with some of the latest technology, but don’t want to spend a ton. It has 2500Pa of suction, dynamic navigation and WiFi connectivity with support for Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MF8N8SD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=buyersguide2022-20&amp;language=en_US">$370 G30 Hybrid</a>, on the other hand, is a slight step up from that. It’s also a WiFi-connected machine with vacuum and mop capabilities, but it includes Smart Dynamic Navigation 2.0, a slightly longer battery life and it comes with boundary strips with which you can set no-go zones (the G20 Hybrid supports this feature, but you’ll have to buy the strips separately).</p>

## OnePlus Nord N300 5G includes a 48MP camera and fast charging for $228

<p>OnePlus' <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-143031687.html">Nord N200</a> had a simple hook: stuff 5G and a big battery into a low-priced phone. There were a few flaws, though, and the company is partly addressing them with the just-announced Nord N300 5G.  The follow-up switches from the Snapdragon 480 chip to a speedier (if not exactly blazing) MediaTek Dimensity 810. You'll also find a 48MP main camera versus the N200's 13MP unit, a slightly larger 6.56-inch 90Hz display and faster 33W charging (up from 18W). Yes, the necessary charger comes in the box.</p><p>Other features will sound very familiar, for better or for worse. The 5,000mAh battery is still huge for the class, and the combination of a 3.5mm headphone jack and a microSD slot (now supporting up to 1TB) could prove appealing if you're no fan of wireless earbuds or paying extra for storage. There's just 64GB of space built-in, though, and the 2MP depth camera won't be thrilling. There's also a downgrade: the display resolution is just 1,612 x 720 versus the 2,400 x 1,080 of the N200.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The price may be sweet, at least. The Nord N300 5G will be available on November 3rd for $228 up-front as an exclusive for T-Mobile and its prepaid Metro brand. That lack of choice is unfortunate, but there's also a good chance your monthly instalment payments will be tiny.&nbsp;</p><p>OnePlus has a strong incentive to release the Nord N300, whether or not it represents a meaningful upgrade. The Nord series is a relatively hot seller in North America, with 1.5 million N200s expected to sell in 2022. While that figure won't give Apple or Samsung reason for pause, it's no mean feat for a budget device largely limited to one carrier in the US. The new model could keep that momentum going.</p>

## Apple's redesigned iPad is mostly worth the higher price

<p>In 2017, Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-06-apple-ipad-2017-review.html">released a $329 iPad</a>, and ever since the company has said that this basic tablet is its most popular. It’s easy to see why: When I <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-9th-generation-review-143045685.html">reviewed last year’s model last fall</a>, I found that this relatively modest device could do almost everything I normally do with my pricier 11-inch iPad Pro. That said, in a world where Apple has gotten rid of the home button and trimmed the bezels on all of its tablets, the basic iPad was starting to feel stale.</p><p>So this year, for its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BJLT98Q7/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=buyersguide2022-20&amp;language=en_US">tenth generation</a>, Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-2022-redesign-price-release-date-151311307.html">rebuilt the iPad</a>, taking obvious inspiration from the iPad Air. It has the same size screen, cameras, USB-C port, optional 5G networking and Touch ID-enabled power button, all of which are improvements over last year’s model. It also has an A14 chip, which doesn’t stack up to the M1 in the iPad Air and M2 in the new iPad Pro, but it’s still a capable piece of silicon. Apple even designed a new keyboard and trackpad folio, the first iPad keyboard that the company made with a function key row.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Of course, Apple had to cut some corners to differentiate this iPad from the Air. The usual compromises are here — namely, the screen isn’t quite as good as the one on the Air, with no full lamination on the front glass, anti-reflective coating or support for the wider P3 color gamut. It also still only supports the first-generation Apple Pencil, which is a pretty major bummer for anyone looking for an improved stylus experience.</p><figure><img alt="iPad (2022) - back view" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/5fd8e090-5319-11ed-b7e9-47b14c73d85e" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>And all the changes Apple made means the iPad is no longer the tremendous value it was — it now costs $449, while last year’s 9th-generation iPad stays in the lineup at its original $329 price. I’ll be giving the new iPad a full review soon, but in the meantime, here are my first impressions after spending a few days with it.</p><p>While the new iPad is ever so slightly larger and thicker than the Air, my first feeling picking it up was one of complete familiarity. It feels almost exactly like the Air, but it’s obviously a completely different experience than using last year’s model with the old Home button. While the 10.9-inch display isn’t significantly bigger than the old 10.2-inch screen, it’s just big enough to make multitasking more comfortable. I miss things like the iPad Pro’s fully laminated display and 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate, but I notice the “air gap” between the screen and front glass less on this iPad than any of the older basic models. While the iPad Air technically has a better screen than this tablet, the difference between the two models has been significantly reduced.</p><p>Between the bigger screen and the new trackpad-equipped Magic Keyboard Folio, I feel a lot more productive on the new iPad than I did on last year’s model. The trackpad may be small, but when you’re using the iPad with a keyboard, it’s a lot more convenient to use than reaching up to tap the screen every time you want to move a cursor or switch apps. And the row of function keys that Apple included on the Smart Keyboard Folio is something that should have been included on every other iPad keyboard the company has made, so I can’t give them too much credit for finally getting things right here.</p><figure><img alt="iPad (2022) and folio with kickstand" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/8c1caa10-5319-11ed-ba3f-8b9890f38c1a" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>That said, it’s still handy to have an escape key and a handful of other useful shortcuts right there when you need them. Between that and the trackpad, you can get away without not having to touch the screen for longer stretches than ever before (that might lead you to ask why you’re using an iPad in the first place, but I’ll save those philosophical questions for my full review). Meanwhile, the typing experience is significantly better than the one the old Smart Keyboard cover offered, and the keys feel quite similar to the Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro and Air. I’m much more likely to use this iPad for long typing sessions than I was with last year’s model. As with most things Apple, though, this comes at a price — this new keyboard costs a whopping $249.</p><p>I’ve been using an M1-powered, 12.9-inch iPad Pro for much of the last four months as a testing device for iPadOS 16, so I had some concerns about the A14 chip on the new iPad. I shouldn’t have worried; while occasional things like swiping up to see all my open apps felt a little less smooth than I’d like, overall the new iPad is holding up extremely well so far. I can swipe through my library of RAW photos in Lightroom with no slowdowns, the games I’ve tried so far (including <em>Skate City, Spire Blast</em> and <em>Mini Motorways</em>) have all run perfectly and apps load quickly when I swap between them or pull up a few different ones at a time in Split View and Slide Over modes.</p><p>The only real catch I’ve noticed with the A14 compared to more powerful chips like the M1 is that apps often have to reload their content, probably because there’s less RAM here. For example, if I navigated away from the file I’m writing this in, I’d usually have to re-open it when I went back to Google Docs; it didn’t keep the file loaded in memory.</p><p>Before I can fully evaluate this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BJLT98Q7/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=buyersguide2022-20&amp;language=en_US">new iPad</a>, I need to push the A14 further with more intensive tasks; try out the new cameras (including the landscape-oriented front-facing camera!); dig more into the new features in iPadOS 16; and relive my frustration with the first-generation Apple Pencil. But at first glance, I’m slightly bummed about the price hike, but I recognize that these updates are a major improvement to the iPad experience. My thoughts so far are that spending the extra $120 to get this iPad instead of last year’s model is worth it, and that most people will even prefer it to the $600 iPad Air.</p>

## The new iPad Pro is ludicrously fast (just like last year's model)

<p>Evaluating the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-m2-wifi-6e-151254512.html">new iPad Pro</a> is a simpler task than the basic iPad that Apple announced alongside it last week. That iPad has been completely redesigned. But the 2022 iPad Pro is a minor iteration of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2021-m1-review-liquid-retina-xdr-5g-features-price-130049005.html">the model released in early 2021</a>, which was powered by the M1 chip. Now, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-review-2022-130040098.html">with M2 Macs</a> out in the wild, Apple decided its best tablet needed one, too.</p><p>That new chip is by far the most notable change here. Otherwise, the design, screen, cameras, storage options, accessories and price are all the same. That’s not a big problem, though, because the iPad Pro was already an outstanding device — and the Liquid Retina XDR display Apple introduced on last year’s 12.9-inch model is still a simply outstanding screen. There are a couple new tricks here, like the Apple Pencil “hover” feature and the ability to shoot video in Apple’s ProRes codec, but by and large this iPad Pro isn’t angled at people who bought that M1 model. Instead, it’s just a case of Apple flexing its muscles by making the most powerful, spare-no-expense tablet that it can.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the short time that I’ve been testing the latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro, I can say that it’s far more responsive than my personal 11-inch iPad Pro from 2020 as well as the new iPad I’ve also been testing. Those other devices aren’t slow by any stretch of the imagination, but the M2-powered iPad Pro responds to everything almost instantaneously. Of course, the same can be said about the M1 iPad Pro, especially given my modest workflow.</p><figure><img alt="Apple iPad Pro (2022) with Magic Keyboard" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/6624a260-531c-11ed-8765-aa26e5994a6a" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>In a demo last week, Apple showed how the new iPad Pro can chew through apps like the forthcoming DaVinci Resolve and Octane X. The former is an intense video application that combines things like professional-level color correction, color grading, visual effects and much more, while Octane X is meant for 3D rendering. Both apps are pretty far outside things I’d use, but in the demo it was pretty easy to see how responsive the new iPad Pro was scrubbing through and editing frames from an 8K video or applying different effects.</p><p>One thing I can tell is that the new Stage Manager multitasking feature in iPadOS 16 is working much better on this new iPad Pro than it did in my testing on last year’s model using various beta releases over the last four months or so. Again, my needs are modest, but I never had any app crashes or moments where the interface just shut down and threw me back to the Home Screen. In a sign of Apple’s confidence, Stage Manager was even enabled out of the box, whereas it was turned off by default when iPadOS 16 was in beta.</p><p>Conceptually, I’m still struggling a bit with how Stage Manager decides what apps (or groups of apps) show up on the left-side switcher, and I feel like the experience of using it on any iPad smaller than the 12.9-inch Pro is not going to be much better than just using two apps in Split View, but it does seem a lot more stable now. I don’t know if that’s thanks to software optimizations, the more powerful hardware or some mix of both, but it’s a welcome change.</p><p>If you’re an Apple Pencil aficionado, the M2 enables a pretty cool new feature called Hover. As the name suggests, the iPad Pro can detect when the Pencil is within 12mm of the screen, and elements will start to react. For example, if you hold the Pencil over the apps in your dock or on the homescreen, the one that the Pencil is over will zoom in slightly to show you what you’re targeting. It’s similar to what happens when you use the trackpad to move the pointer over apps. It’s not the most essential trick, but it’s a good example of what Hover can do. But this is just a trick that doesn’t really change the iPad experience; developers will need to build Hover functions into their apps for it to be really useful.</p><figure><img alt="Apple iPad Pro (2022)" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/7cf40530-531c-11ed-b6d8-f7a7af855a6a" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>That said, I was able to see a few potential use cases for it. In the Notes app, there’s a new watercolor brush, and when you hover the Pencil over the screen you’ll get a little preview of the color you’ve selected. And when you select a new color, you can hover the Pencil over your existing sketch to see how the watercolor interacts with it before actually drawing. In a demo of the illustration and animation app Procreate, hovering the Pencil over a project brings the animation to life or shows a 3D view of your creation. It’s one of those features that is clever but doesn’t have an essential use case yet, but I’m definitely curious to see how developers implement it.</p><p>Otherwise, most of what we said about the iPad Pro in 2021 still applies here. Performance is outstanding, the screen is one of the nicest that we’ve seen on any device, the Pencil and Magic Keyboard are great but expensive add-ons, but iPadOS 16 still feels like it occasionally holds back the hardware here. Over the next few days, I’m going to do more detailed performance testing to see how the M2 compares to the M1, though we already have a good idea of how that’ll play out thanks to how M2-powered Macs stack up to older models. Even after a few days, I’m pretty sure that people who own the M1 iPad Pro don’t need to worry about upgrading. If you really push your iPad Pro to the limit, and it’s a few years old, these new models should offer a pretty significant upgrade.</p>

## Urtopia's tech-heavy ebike is only as good as its software

<p>At the tail end of last year, a curious new entry into the ebike market emerged: <a href="https://newurtopia.com/">Urtopia</a>. The company’s mission seemed pretty clear, to make the most feature-rich, connected bike the world has ever seen. And with a built-in 4G SIM, WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, a fingerprint reader and mmWave sensors for collision detection, it was likely accomplished. Except, the model we tested was a prototype leaving us unable to evaluate some of the more interesting features. Until now.</p><p>The retail version of the bike is almost identical to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/urtopia-ebike-is-the-most-tech-heavy-weve-seen-140046298.html">pre-production version we tested</a> at the end of last year bar a few minor cosmetic details. The D-pad on the left handle has been slightly redesigned and the fingerprint reader on the right is also now a button. The only other visible change is the dot-matrix display, which is now flat and easier to read.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Perhaps one of the main features we couldn’t test wasn’t available at all – the app. With so much going on in the bike, it’s more important to have a companion tool on your phone to confirm settings and to extract more use out of some of the sensors (ride tracking, for example).</p><figure><img alt="A front view of the Urtopia ebike." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/2d0f3130-514f-11ed-abec-db88bfb10913" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>All I’ll say is, the bike might be the final hardware, but the software side of things started out a little... less complete. But in the space of a few weeks, the app has been redesigned and there have been a couple of firmware updates for the bike itself and the experience feels much less like a work in progress.</p><p>But first a little reminder. The Urtopia bike is a fixed-gear (Gates carbon belt), single hub-motor ebike with three levels of speed assistance (20MPH in the US, 15MPH in Europe). The 30lbs/15Kg city bike offers approximately 60 miles of assistance out of the 360Wh battery. That’s a fairly common spec for an ebike, but one look at the Urtopia will tell you this isn’t really a normal bike.</p><p>Last time around I was able to test Urtopia’s cred as a general road bike, and despite a slightly stiff ride (there’s no suspension) it performed well, with smooth pickup from the torque-based motor. The voice control for changing speed, locking the bike and more was also fun but perhaps not the smoothest experience (and even if it were, I’m not sure we’re collectively ready to be speaking to our bikes in public yet).</p><p>The first thing I wanted to try here was the 4G connectivity. Utopia isn’t unique in having a cellular connection (newer VanMoofs, for example, also offer connectivity), but the 4G here is behind a few interesting features. For once, you’ll (theoretically) get a log of your ride in the app every single time you go out. I say theoretically as it often didn’t work for me. Then sometimes it did. I couldn’t quite pin down what caused it to work sometimes and not others, but I suspect it’s to do with whether you leave the bike in standby while at home, or if you power it down (thus fully resetting the sensors).</p><p>After one of the firmware updates this feature became more reliable. Which is good, because it was frustrating to put in double-digit miles only to come home and find your ride wasn’t logged. Right now, there’s not a lot you can do with the data other than see where you went and how fast in a slick animation. It, of course, logs all your miles and… as I went to check the app for what other data it records there was an app update (duration, calories, average speed and even CO2 saved is the answer). Right now, you can only share the rides with the in-app “community” but the option to share to services like Strava would be a real positive.</p><figure><img alt="Screenshots of the Urtopia ebike app" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/f07ff510-514e-11ed-af3f-e8d8e1f69735" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>In a similar way, the app can also tell you exactly where your bike is at any time, as long as the battery is connected and has enough power to ping the network. It will stop working once the battery totally dies, of course, but if someone steals your ride, you should have plenty of time to ping it and locate it before they realize it’s the world’s most connected bike and what a fool’s errand stealing it was.&nbsp;</p><p>Another security feature is the fingerprint sensor. This was physically present on the prototype, but without the app, there was no way to set it up. It works surprisingly well and allows you to turn the bike on or to disable the alarm quickly. You can still ride the bike without assistance without unlocking the bike with your finger, but it’s effectively a cumbersome fixie at this point. Unless you turn the alarm on, then it’ll start sounding an alert at the slightest, and I mean <em>slightest </em>movement which can only be disabled with a registered digit.</p><p>One of the more intriguing additions to the Urtopia’s spec sheet are the mmWave sensors. These are designed to detect vehicles approaching from behind on either side. If something is detected, you’ll be alerted through a visual signal and vibrating handlebars. In practice, it’s a little hard to test without deliberately endangering yourself, but it does seem to work. Although, I am not sure whether, if faced with a truck coming up behind, you might be more distracted by the alerts than the traffic itself. That’s to say, this is clearly a valuable feature, but the outcome of it is hard to quantify at this time.</p><figure><img alt="Urtopia ebike's built-in navigation." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/69c99c00-514f-11ed-bdfb-8b6d2ea9828a" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Something much easier to evaluate is the onboard navigation. Or rather, the ability to punch a destination into the app, and then have visual and audio turn instructions via the speaker and display on the handlebars. There are, of course, other ways to do this - either with a phone in a mount or maybe just in your pocket with audio instructions via headphones. But having it here right in the handlebars feels a lot more futuristic and means you don’t have to expose your phone to the elements/thieves.</p><p>The dot-matrix screen does have a bit of a retro vibe to it, and makes it feel a bit more like KITT (especially when it speaks to you). For the navigation, this works well enough as the arrows/directions are shown clearly enough that you can glance at them without being distracted.</p><p>Urtopia calls this screen and speaker combo the “smart bar” and it has other plans for it beyond serving up data and other visual feedback. One example is using the bike’s speaker as a Bluetooth speaker for music. This may have accidentally been my idea. I suggested it to them the first time we tested it, and now it’s part of the app. It’s kinda fun, though I have never felt quite so self conscious as I did riding through a busy park with phonecall-quality Drum &amp; Bass playing from my bike. Podcasts might be a bit more its speed, but happy to see the feature here nonetheless.</p><figure><img alt="A game of the Nokia-classic, Snake, is shown on the Urtopia ebike's built-in display." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/9ccfd030-514d-11ed-a5af-14f3be3c6012" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>There is… more. Another addition that was conceived after our initial testing is “game” mode. It’s not quite what you’re likely imagining. Or at least, what I was imagining. I assumed it might be some sort of virtual race where you have to “catch” up with a ghost rider like in a Mario Kart time trial. Or maybe some sort of way of making training/intervals fun? But no, it’s actually a game of Snake you can play on the display using the control buttons which, to be fair, are basically a D-pad. Obviously, not to be played while moving.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest chance since we last looked at the bike is the price. Now that the crowd-funding campaign is complete and the bikes are made and ready to ship, the $2,000 early-bird price has given way to the regular $2,799 retail price. That puts it in a similar category to something like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cowboy-4-electric-bike-launches-with-a-step-through-model-121513629.html">Cowboy C4</a> which has fewer high-tech features, but does have the important theft detection and locating capabilities.</p><p>All to say that, the Urtopia definitely has a lot of tech appeal, but it still feels like the software and features are settling into themselves. If they can continue to make that side of the experience as comfortable and as exciting as it is to ride, this will be a solid choice for those that want a capital-E e-bike.</p>

## The Morning After: Bono finally apologizes for that free iTunes U2 album

<p>Once upon a time, back in 2014, U2 gave away an album's worth of songs to every iTunes user in the world. And a lot of people were not happy. The blowback was so intense that Apple had to release a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-09-15-how-to-get-the-new-u2-album-songs-of-innocence-out-of-your-itu.html">special tool</a> to remove it. And it was all Bono’s fault, as he explained in an interview with <em>The Guardian</em> over the weekend.</p><p>When Bono approached Tim Cook, along with Eddy Cue and Phil Schiller about the idea, he was met with some incredulity. "Are you talking about free music?" Cook said.</p><p>In Bono’s words: "'No,' I said, 'I don’t think we give it away free. I think you pay us for it and then you give it away free, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-10-15-bono-apology-for-itunes-giveaway.html">as a gift to people</a>.'" Cook was apparently not convinced, asking if it would be distributed only to U2 fans, and the singer replied: “I think we should give it away to everybody.” No, Bono, no!</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a newsletter –  it’s also a daily podcast.
