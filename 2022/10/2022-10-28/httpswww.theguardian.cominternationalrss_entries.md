You can go on there and type your embarrassing little thoughts for the whole world to see any time you like. Millions of us have been doing this for years. Revealing to everyone how dumb your inner thoughts are may cost you your reputation, sure, but it won’t cost you any money. Not even if you’re the richest man in the country.</p><p>So why spend $44bn to buy it? That’s a fair piece of change, even to someone whose net worth hovers above $200bn. It’s also much more than the company is actually worth, as evidenced by Elon Musk’s desperate attempt to get out of the deal almost as soon as he had gotten irretrievably into it. The price is too high to be a pure lifestyle purchase – if you want a media property just for the social cachet and party invitations, it can be had much cheaper.

It is no exaggeration to say Marsch’s disarming warmth away from the pitch has bought him extra time in West Yorkshire.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/oct/28/jesse-marsch-enters-extra-time-at-leeds-liverpool">Continue reading...</a>

## Jerry Lee Lewis: a thrilling one-of-a-kind showman who was mired in scandal

<p>The death of the rock’n’roll pioneer leaves behind a frenetic career filled with professional highs and personal lows</p><p>In October 1973, Jerry Lee Lewis was booked to play a showcase gig at The Roxy, a newly-opened LA club that immediately attracted a clientele heavy on rock stars: among its co-owners were David Geffen, Neil Young’s manager Elliot Roberts and famed producer Lou Adler. Lewis was, in theory at least, in the throes of another comeback. He had just completed work on an album called The Session, recorded in London with an all-star backing band: Kenney Jones of the Faces, Rory Gallagher and Peter Frampton among them. By all accounts the sessions hadn’t gone terribly well. Propped up by booze and amphetamines, Lewis’ behavior was volatile: Rory Gallagher recalled that whenever something displeased him, Lewis would reach for his sock, where, it was believed, he concealed a gun. Still, the combined contemporary star power of his guests helped the album to Lewis’ highest US chart placing in a decade.</p><p>But if Lewis was pleased about the attention paid to him by a younger generation of musicians, he had a funny way of showing it: when John Lennon walked into The Roxy that night, Lewis stopped playing and began berating him from the stage: “[he] started on about how the Beatles were shit and the Stones were shit and there ain’t nobody could play real rock’n’roll the way Jerry Lee could,” recalled Gallagher. For his part, Lennon seemed entirely unbothered. After the show, he walked into Lewis’ dressing room, dropped to his knees and kissed his feet, before asking for an autograph from the man he called “the real king of rock’n’roll”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/28/jerry-lee-lewis-death-scandal-showman">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is a link between money and happiness, says Prof Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, but it’s much stronger at the bottom of the pay scale</p><p>Money can buy happiness – just ask anyone without it.

I asked Prof Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, director at the University of Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, what the data says.</p><p><strong>Given we’re in a cost of living crisis, does this question even matter? Survival first, happiness later, right?</strong><br />How we feel about the quality of our lives is what matters. So is there a link between money and happiness? Absolutely – especially at the bottom of the pay scale. As you move up, there are diminishing returns. So the wellbeing boost from a £20,000 salary moving to £40,000 would be significant, but to achieve that again, you’d have to move from £40,000 to £80,000, then £80,000 to £160,000.

## The Devil’s Hour review – proof that Peter Capaldi is the world’s most terrifying actor

<p>That face! The grief it conveys! The ex-Doctor’s turn in this new supernatural crime drama is chilling – and joins a stunning performance from Jessica Raine as a harrowed mother</p><p>I do not damn with faint praise when I say that the back of Peter Capaldi’s head is the most frightening thing in the opening episode of The Devil’s Hour, Amazon Prime Video’s new spooky six-part drama by Tom Moran. I mean only to place on record the underacknowledged truth that Capaldi is the most frightening actor working today. The only reason a generation of children were not permanently traumatised by his years as Doctor Who is because they do not yet know enough of life. If you do, you see that all of it lives in Capaldi’s face and that most of it is suffering, grief and pain.</p><p>We see little of that haunted visage at first, though it is clear his character is the pivot around which the whole thing will swing. Our main concern is with Lucy (Jessica Raine), an overstretched social worker also dealing with an aged mother who has dementia, the end of her marriage to Mike (Phil Dunster) and an unreachable, heartbreaking puzzle of a child, Isaac (Benjamin Chivers). He is emotionless, suggestible, vulnerable and given to seeing and hearing from figures invisible to others. Lucy wakes up every night at 3.33am exactly, wrenched from awful visions as she sleeps. Are they ordinary nightmares caused by current stresses and strains, or the results of buried trauma – as other momentary hallucinations and apparent flashbacks suggest? Or are they, as Capaldi’s face implies, something worse?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/oct/28/the-devils-hour-review-amazon-prime-peter-capaldi-jessica-raine">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Sussexes draw more ire than genocidal dictators – from people who struggle to articulate exactly what their problem is</p><p>The interior designer and social commentator Nicky Haslam has just released the latest annual version of his fabled tea towel, on which he lists some more of the things that he “finds common”. (This year’s entries include Bond Street, coriander, divorce, porn, Stanley Johnson, hydrangeas, foundations and side plates.) Far be it from any of us to suggest culprits for the next one, but I do think “being angry with Meghan and Harry” should be a contender. Let’s be honest: there really isn’t much more desperately naff than allowing oneself to be conversationally infuriated by the commercial behaviour/comings-and-goings/mere existence of “the Sussexes”. It is <em>hugely</em> infra dig.</p><p>And yet the couple continue to drive swathes of people quite mad. For a huge throng of the vicariously enraged, this week’s release of the cover of Harry’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/27/prince-harry-unflinching-memoir-spare-to-be-published-in-january">forthcoming memoir </a>has once again proved a ticket to near-apoplexy.

<p><strong>(Westbury Road)<br /></strong>Her first single in six years is a breezy, lightweight ballad for the new Black Panther film – the sound of money not artistry</p><p>I remember, vividly, waiting up one night in early 2016 to listen to Work, the first single from Rihanna’s eighth album, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/28/rihanna-anti-album-review-brave-bold-and-confused">Anti</a>. I was expecting some kind of supreme banger – a hit of equivalent euphoria to songs like We Found Love or Only Girl in the World. When I heard the song, I couldn’t help but feel that it was a little soft – a sad, surprisingly elliptical return. I filed it away under “sub-par Rihanna songs” only for it to work its way into my heart over the next few months; now it’s one of my favourite pop songs ever and a clear precedent for a wave of pop stars intent on singing about the quotidian drudgery of celebrity. (It also contains one of the most perfect pop lyrics – “Nobody text me in a crisis.”)</p><p>Rihanna’s first new track in six years, Lift Me Up, feels similarly limp on arrival – although perhaps with less chance of escaping from the also-rans pile. Written and recorded for the soundtrack to the forthcoming Black Panther sequel, it’s hardly the klaxon for a radical new era of Rihanna and is likely unrelated to the supposedly reggae-influenced ninth album that fans are breathlessly anticipating. Instead it’s a soft, swaying ballad built around a lovely arpeggiating harp and serene strings courtesy of Ludwig Göransson (who composed the Black Panther score).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/28/rihanna-lift-me-up-review-good-girl-gone-drab">Continue reading...</a>

A warning repeated to me with musicality, almost like the chants of English fans at matches. “Sylvio. The pace in the Premier League is very high.” In my early days at Arsenal, that was the only thing I understood in English. But I wasn’t worried about the language – I went to London without knowing a word – the food or the English way of life. I knew it would all come. It was just a matter of time.</p><p>My only concern was adapting to the pace of the English game. If I wanted to play for Arsenal, I had to do it as quickly as possible. At Corinthians, I was the classic Brazilian full-back: a player who attacked a lot on my flank – which was the left. In fact, almost all of my actions in a game would involve running forward. I didn’t have many demands on my defensive work. All of this was also conditioned by the style of play of Brazilian football itself – a little slower than English football.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/oct/28/sylvinho-first-brazilian-arsenal-highbury-corinthians">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Playing the castrated, traumatised Theon in Game of Thrones took a lot out of the actor. Thankfully his new role in an SAS drama is a bit more fun</p><p>When I first speak to the actor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/28/alfie-allen-game-of-thrones-six-pack">Alfie Allen</a>, he is in the back of a taxi and winding his way through country lanes on the outskirts of Frome in Somerset. Judging by the startled look on his face, I’m guessing he has forgotten all about our interview, though, talking nine to the dozen, he is doing his utmost to style it out. Then, just as he is waxing lyrical about Somerset – he spent the early months of lockdown there and loves its proximity to the Glastonbury festival, and to his dad, Keith Allen, who lives in the nearby Cotswolds – the screen freezes. After shouting that he’ll call me when he gets to the house, everything goes dead.</p><p>Half an hour later, he’s back and full of apologies. Parked on a zingy yellow sofa, and dressed in tracksuit bottoms and a hoodie, he talks about the hectic schedule that has seen him zipping back and forth between the UK and America. Home is officially London, though his house is rented out since he is there so infrequently – “So I’m being a bit nomadic, which I like.” He says much of the last year has been spent either visiting his four-year-old daughter, Arrow, who lives with her mother in Los Angeles, or working in New York.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/oct/28/alfie-allen-i-had-to-go-to-dark-places-to-play-theon-greyjoy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From sharp and puffy to flutes and trumpets, there’s a wealth of shapes that can make an outfit look bang up to date</p><p>There are flutes and there are trumpets. There are milkmaids and bishops. Anne Boleyn has skin in the name game, as does FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan. I’m talking about sleeves. The statement sleeve has been the hardiest fashion silhouette of the past decade. The swinging 60s had the miniskirt; now we have the mega-sleeve. Because there are endless shapes and sizes of sleeve, it feels like a different look every season. Shoulders were sharp a few years ago; last year was all about puff. But what we have here is one overarching trend: a statement sleeve has become a key detail that makes an outfit look modern.</p><p>Cast your mind back, and you will recall a time before that when sleeves were, well, arm-shaped, and their only notable detail was whether they were short or long. Long sleeves were what you wore on cold days or if you didn’t like your arms. Short sleeves were for summer, or all year round if you had Michelle Obama-ish triceps, widely understood to be the external manifestation of a dynamic and highly disciplined character type, therefore to be displayed whenever possible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/oct/28/whatever-its-shape-let-a-statement-sleeve-do-all-the-talking">Continue reading...</a>
