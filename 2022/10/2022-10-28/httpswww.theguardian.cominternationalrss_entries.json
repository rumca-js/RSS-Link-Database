Lewis was, in theory at least, in the throes of another comeback. He had just completed work on an album called The Session, recorded in London with an all-star backing band: Kenney Jones of the Faces, Rory Gallagher and Peter Frampton among them. By all accounts the sessions hadn\u2019t gone terribly well. Propped up by booze and amphetamines, Lewis\u2019 behavior was volatile: Rory Gallagher recalled that whenever something displeased him, Lewis would reach for his sock, where, it was believed, he concealed a gun. Still, the combined contemporary star power of his guests helped the album to Lewis\u2019 highest US chart placing in a decade.</p><p>But if Lewis was pleased about the attention paid to him by a younger generation of musicians, he had a funny way of showing it: when John Lennon walked into The Roxy that night, Lewis stopped playing and began berating him from the stage: \u201c[he] started on about how the Beatles were shit and the Stones were shit and there ain\u2019t nobody could play real rock\u2019n\u2019roll the way Jerry Lee could,\u201d recalled Gallagher. For his part, Lennon seemed entirely unbothered. After the show, he walked into Lewis\u2019 dressing room, dropped to his knees and kissed his feet, before asking for an autograph from the man he called \u201cthe real king of rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/28/jerry-lee-lewis-death-scandal-showman\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2022/oct/28/jerry-lee-lewis-life-in-pictures", "title": "Jerry Lee Lewis \u2013 a life in pictures", "date_published": "2022-10-28 18:22:18+00:00", "description": "<p>The pioneering rock\u2019n\u2019roller has died at the age of 87 after a career that saw him rise to the top yet struggle to remain out of trouble</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/28/jerry-lee-lewis-rock-n-roll-star-dead\">Jerry Lee Lewis, US rock\u2019n\u2019roll star, dies aged 87</a><br /></li></ul> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2022/oct/28/jerry-lee-lewis-life-in-pictures\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/28/wasps-suspended-from-premiership-as-rfu-confirms-relegation", "title": "Wasps suspended from Premiership and will be relegated, RFU confirms", "date_published": "2022-10-28 18:16:28+00:00", "description": "<ul><li>Wasps set for Championship in 2023 but are \u00a3100m in debt</li><li>RFU: \u2018Condition of any deal includes paying all creditors\u2019</li></ul><p>Wasps have been officially suspended from the Premiership for the rest of the season and the Rugby Football Union has confirmed the club\u2019s relegation to the Championship next term.</p><p>The move was expected by the RFU, given Wasps were put into administration earlier this month with 167 employees - including all players and staff - made redundant and it leaves Premiership officials now planning to see out the rest of the season with just 11 clubs.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/28/wasps-suspended-from-premiership-as-rfu-confirms-relegation\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/29/new-zealand-has-just-passed-a-law-that-will-revolutionise-workers-rights-it-probably-wont-last", "title": "New Zealand has just passed a law that will revolutionise workers\u2019 rights.
