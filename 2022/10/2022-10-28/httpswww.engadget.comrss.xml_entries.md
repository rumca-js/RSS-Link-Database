<p>It’s been less than a day since Elon Musk began <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html"><ins>his takeover</ins></a> of Twitter, but his move to the top of the company is already impacting the platform. Following the news that the deal was completed, and that he had begun purging some of the company’s executive staff, some groups opted to test Twitter’s moderation rules.</p><p><em>The Washington Post</em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/10/28/musk-twitter-racist-posts/"><ins>also reported</ins></a> that “racial slurs were posted rampantly overnight,” in the hours immediately after Musk’s takeover. The Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), a nonprofit organization that studies disinformation on social platforms, said Friday morning that it had observed a sharp uptick in the n-word on Twitter.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Evidence suggests that bad actors are trying to test the limits on @Twitter,” the group said. “Several posts on 4chan encourage users to amplify derogatory slurs.”</p><div id="6ceb70dfe8a84bb28526a72b35448cf0"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Evidence suggests that bad actors are trying to test the limits on <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Twitter</a>. Several posts on 4chan encourage users to amplify derogatory slurs. <br /><br />For example, over the last 12 hours, the use of the n-word has increased nearly 500% from the previous average. <a href="https://t.co/mEqziaWuMF">pic.twitter.com/mEqziaWuMF</a></p>— Network Contagion Research Institute (@ncri_io) <a href="https://twitter.com/ncri_io/status/1586007698910646272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>A Twitter spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comment. As both <em>The Post</em> and NCRI point out, much of this seems to be organized on platforms like 4Chan and TheDonald, where users are encouraging each other to spread hate.</p><p>For now, it’s unclear how widespread these efforts are. As with past harassment campaigns, a small group of trolls can have an outsize impact, particularly at a moment of upheaval for the company.  Musk, who according to <em>Bloomberg</em> has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-28/musk-is-said-to-take-twitter-ceo-role-reverse-life-bans"><ins>temporarily assumed</ins></a> CEO duties at the company, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-moderation-council-elon-musk-193142274.html"><ins>said Friday</ins></a> that he would not be reinstating any banned accounts or making “major” changes to the company’s content policies until he could for a “content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints.”</p><div id="18acae5e4bdc4be5a410930c5614285a"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Twitter will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints. <br /><br />No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1586059953311137792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>He also <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1585959864454459393"><ins>responded</ins></a> to a Twitter account called Catturd, which had complained about shadowbans and losing followers, that he would be “digging in more.” Musk has previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-ted-181607962.html"><ins>said</ins></a> that he wants to do away with permanent bans on the platform and that he would “err on the side of, if in doubt, let the speech exist.”</p><p>Notably, the uptick in racist slurs comes one day after Musk appealed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-advertisers-hellscape-172909516.html"><ins>to Twitter’s advertisers</ins></a>, saying  that he didn’t want to turn the platform into a “free-for-all hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences.”</p><p>But the increase in hate speech has further fueled concerns that Twitter’s years-long effort to clean up its platforms could be reversed under Musk. Already, he has fired the company’s top policy executive, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-disparage-twitter-employees-224616582.html"><ins>Vijaya Gadde</ins></a>, who played a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/09/twitter-lawyer-censor-musk/"><ins>central role </ins></a>in shaping the company’s content rules. That’s concerning, says Paul Barrett, deputy director of NYU’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights.</p><p>“The danger here is that in the name of ‘free speech,’ Musk will turn back the clock and make Twitter into a more potent engine of hatred, divisiveness, and misinformation about elections, public health policy, and international affairs,” Barrett said in a statement. “This is not going to be pretty.”</p>

## Elon Musk says Twitter will form a 'moderation council' before it reinstates banned accounts

<p>Twitter isn't about to rush into big content policy changes now that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html">Elon Musk owns the company</a>. Musk has <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1586059953311137792">announced</a> that the social network will form a moderation council with members holding "widely diverse viewpoints." There won't be any "major" content decisions or ban reversals until that council meets, the entrepreneur says.</p><p>Musk hasn't named council members or provided a timeline for the council's creation. We've asked Twitter if it can comment on the strategy or provide additional details, and we'll let you know if we hear more.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Tesla chief has vowed to make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-ted-181607962.html">substantial changes</a> to Twitter's moderation policy, such as relaxing the overall rules and limiting permanent bans on people <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-he-would-reverse-donald-trump-twitter-ban-182237750.html">like Donald Trump</a>. However, the council plans suggest Musk could take some time to implement a new approach, and may delegate at least some of the responsibility. He recently tried to reassure advertisers that Twitter won't become a "<a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-advertisers-hellscape-172909516.html">free-for-all hellscape</a>" where ads run alongside horrific posts.</p><div id="ed950fc9eb8b4db8ba9fc0fb55adc186"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Twitter will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints. <br /><br />No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1586059953311137792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>This isn't to say Musk is avoiding all swift decisions. He has already fired multiple executives, including policy head Vijaya Gadde. Musk reportedly informed rank-and-file staff that he won't lay off <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-wont-layoff-75-percent-of-staff-122948434.html">as many people as feared</a>, but he's still expected to cut jobs in relatively short order. Tesla engineers are believed to be helping with a code review that could lead to technical revisions.</p><p>If and when the council arrives, critics will be watching it closely. Conservatives have long accused Twitter of silencing right-wing viewpoints, and have gone so far as to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/florida-supreme-court-petition-social-media-regulation-195239421.html">enact state laws</a> that force social networks to carry more content. Others, however, have rejected the claims and contended that strong moderation is necessary to prevent hate speech and misinformation from gaining traction. A moderation panel theoretically addresses both sides of the debate, but its effectiveness is far from established at this stage.</p>

A fully charged case will more than double those times and the case can be charged wirelessly, unlike the non-pro (A-Series) model.</p><p>The controls let you access the Google Assistant, skip tracks, activate ANC, take calls and more with  on-board taps and presses that are fully configurable.

You still get the power to treat your tablet like a PC, using Dex mode that switches from a standard Android interface to a more powerful desktop-like view. The improved Qualcomm Snapdragon chip makes the S8 speedy and responsive, and the included S Pen feels great in the hand and makes for satisfying doodle sessions and easy note taking.&nbsp;</p><p>The all-day battery means you won't have to stop what you're doing to find an outlet (though that capacity takes a noticeable dip with graphics-heavy tasks like streaming or gaming). With its bright display and full-sounding speakers, it's a great pick for a premium tablet — and now it's at a less-premium price.&nbsp;</p><a class="athena-button rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Qcm9kdWN0aXZpdHktUXVhbGNvbW0tU25hcGRyYWdvbi1JbmNsdWRlZC1HcmFwaGl0ZS9kcC9CMDlOUU1KNVhHLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xei0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGY1Mjg4OTItN2U3NC00M2UyLWFjZjQtOGY3ZTg4YTk4ZDI5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAa8E_KFoAfTDPz4mXsjumclL3Do4t7bsXyon3ZZr1ngu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FProductivity-Qualcomm-Snapdragon-Included-Graphite%2Fdp%2FB09NQMJ5XG%2F" id="b0f22735ec404f0fa0a14e98905e3014">Buy Galaxy Tab S8 at Amazon - $550</a><h2>Google Pixel 6a</h2><figure><img alt="Google's Pixel 6a falls to a new all-time low of $299" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/84ce5d00-5371-11ed-9bfb-08b90f2cfd77" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>True, it's not the latest model Pixel, that honor goes to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7-and-pixel-7-pro-review-still-the-best-bargain-in-flagship-phones-170031940.html">just-released Pixel 7</a>, but <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kZWFsL2YyZTc1NGU4P3Nob3dWYXJpYXRpb25zPXRydWUmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMXktMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjhmNTI4ODkyLTdlNzQtNDNlMi1hY2Y0LThmN2U4OGE5OGQyOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQSRXD2a3ygUKse94Pf-fMSCwPwQtd3mDf06FhKJZ1hK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdeal%2Ff2e754e8%3FshowVariations%3Dtrue">the Pixel 6a</a> is still a great smartphone in its own right — and honestly, it's less than six months old.

We think these buds give premium earbuds a run for their money at the $150 list price — at 40 percent off, they're really pulling their weight.&nbsp;</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B096SSCV5K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dealpost2022-20&amp;language=en_US" id="22cfd12a88944a729b49dc8b10068af0">Buy Beats Studio Buds from Amazon - $90</a><h2>Jabra Elite 3</h2><figure><img alt="Jabra Elite 3 review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/816dd930-11b7-11ec-9367-b944dabb6935" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>We called the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9KYWJyYS1XaXJlbGVzcy1CbHVldG9vdGgtRWFyYnVkcy1CdWlsdC9kcC9CMDlCNDVUNTlHP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMXktMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjhmNTI4ODkyLTdlNzQtNDNlMi1hY2Y0LThmN2U4OGE5OGQyOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfV2VuUYEBb0a8QGqgB7L_f69PgA7-Ry-QrWDGezNOzM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Built%2Fdp%2FB09B45T59G%3Fth%3D1">Jabra Elite 3</a> buds "the new standard for affordable wireless earbuds" in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html">review</a> last year and right now they're back down to $50 — that's just $3 more than their lowest ever and an impressive $30 discount off the MSRP.

It remains one of the best general-purpose laptops we've tried and right now Amazon has it for $1,049 a savings of $150 over the list price.&nbsp;</p><p>We were particularly impressed with the overall lightness of the Air, weighing just 2.7 pounds. It's also much more balanced that previous models as Apple's done away with the wedge shape and gone for a uniform thickness. The screen is beautiful, the speakers are great and the performance of the M2 chip makes the laptop plenty speedy.&nbsp;</p><p>The battery lasted over 16 hours in our tests — more than enough for a full work day plus a streaming unwind afterwards. This is the 256GB configuration, which should be fine for most use cases, as long as you're not trying to edit huge video files on a regular basis. The discount only applies to the midnight and silver colorways, but if didn't necessarily have your heart set on the starlight hue, you can nab this all-purpose workhorse for a sweet discount.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a class="athena-button rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLUFwcGxlLU1hY0Jvb2stTGFwdG9wLWNoaXAvZHAvQjBCM0NEWkxUQj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xei0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGY1Mjg4OTItN2U3NC00M2UyLWFjZjQtOGY3ZTg4YTk4ZDI5In0&amp;signature=AQAAARWp8fi37tG5PtFUkFD0J3gp4U1U_xQesARt_E5shomE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F2022-Apple-MacBook-Laptop-chip%2Fdp%2FB0B3CDZLTB" id="46fe2537f47b46b09fe559990de76c3e">Buy Apple MacBook Air M2 at Amazon - $1,049</a><h2>Sonos home theater bundles</h2><figure><img alt="Sonos Beam (Gen 2)" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/89941f80-21a1-11ec-b16f-f0c9f30ee644" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Sonos just launched a <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvcHJvbW90aW9uYWwtb2ZmZXJzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4ZjUyODg5Mi03ZTc0LTQzZTItYWNmNC04ZjdlODhhOThkMjkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQF67xwfpMsK7Xip3b6_wsPrKGhbAZu9Ms33TwZeqm4z&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fpromotional-offers">20-percent-off sale</a> covering bundles of their soundbars, speakers and subwoofers.

## Decade-old Pebble smartwatches gain Pixel 7 support in 'one last update'

<p>It's been nearly a decade since the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/pebble/"><ins>Pebble</ins></a> smartwatch started shipping to backers of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-05-10-pebble-smartwatch-sells-out.html"><ins>wildly successful initial Kickstarter campaign</ins></a>, but there's still life in the ol' dog yet. The wearables are now compatible with Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, as well as 64-bit-only Android devices that will arrive later.</p><p>As noted by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/pebble-a-2013-smartwatch-updated-to-work-with-2022-pixel-7/"><em><ins>Ars Technica</ins></em></a>, Katharine Berry, who works on Wear OS and is a prominent member of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-15-rebble-io-pebble-fitbit.html"><ins>the Rebble group</ins></a> that's keeping the Pebble ecosystem alive, <a href="https://twitter.com/KatharineBerry/status/1584976719395450881"><ins>wrote</ins></a> that the latest Pebble update comes four years after the previous one. The last update allowed for many of the Pebble app's functions to run on independent servers. Fitbit, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-now-owns-fitbit-141747501.html"><ins>Google has since bought</ins></a>, shut down Pebble's servers in 2018, two years after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-07-fitbit-buys-pebble.html"><ins>buying some of the smartwatch maker's assets</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Along with Pixel 7 compatibility, the latest update also improves Caller ID reliability on recent versions of Android. While the app isn't available on the Google Play Store, <a href="https://rebble.io/apk/"><ins>the APK</ins></a> is signed with official Pebble keys and retains <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google%20fit/"><ins>Google Fit</ins></a> integration, Berry noted.</p><p>On the surface, this might finally appear to be the end of the line for Pebble in terms of official support. "Thanks to Google for providing us with one last update," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/ydc1bj/pebble_android_app_version_443_now_available/"><ins>Berry wrote on Reddit</ins></a>. However, as <em>Ars Technica</em> points out, it looks like a Pebble hackathon is set to take place next month. So if your Pebble's e-ink screen and battery are still holding up, it might be useful for a while longer yet.</p><div id="6d7c06f8b52140b396132b9cb48bb4d5"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Today is the 10 year anniversary of the <a href="https://twitter.com/Pebble?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Pebble</a> Kickstarter launch.

The Echo Show 5 technically has an MSRP of $85, but its average street price has typically sat in the $40-50 range in recent months.</p><p></p><p>We gave the Echo Show 5 a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">review score of 85</a> when it launched last year, praising its solid-for-its-size sound quality, compact design, and usual suite of Alexa-aided smart features. Its most natural home is on a bedside table, as the device is fitted with features like a "sunrise" alarm that gradually brightens its screen to more gently wake you up in the morning and the ability to tap the top of the display to snooze an alarm. The device's 960 x 480 resolution display isn't exactly high-end, but it's competent enough given the device's small stature, and an ambient light sensor lets it automatically dim when you turn the lights off at night.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The device still has its uses outside of the bedroom, as it can tell you the weather, play music, display recipes, show Ring security cam feeds and control compatible smart home gear like any other Alexa machine.

## Telegram nixes paid posts on iOS after blowback from Apple

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/telegram/"><ins>Telegram</ins></a> and its users are looking into ways to make more money from the platform. One method users have tried is using third-party payment bots to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/10/27/telegram-paid-posts-channels-apple-in-app-purchases/"><ins>sell paid individual posts</ins></a> on their channels. However, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov says the company had to shut down paid posts on iOS due to a complaint from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple/"><ins>Apple</ins></a>.</p><p>Durov said it "was great" that creators were receiving nearly the full sum of what their fans or subscribers paid for one of their posts. "Unfortunately, we received word from Apple that they were not happy with content creators monetizing their efforts without paying a 30 percent tax to Apple," <a href="https://t.me/durov/199"><ins>he wrote</ins></a>. "Since Apple has complete control over its ecosystem, we had no alternative but to disable such paid posts on iOS devices."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The "30 percent tax" refers to the cut that Apple takes from in-app payments and app purchases. The company's App Store fees have been the target of criticism from many corners, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/news-sites-join-epic-in-fight-against-apples-high-i-os-store-fees-091530276.html"><ins>news publishers</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-13-spotify-apple-complaint-eu-app-store.html"><ins>Spotify</ins></a> and, perhaps most famously, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-app-store-payment-changes-delay-epic-games-201026068.html"><ins>Epic Games</ins></a>.</p><p>Durov took a swipe at Apple, claiming it was a monopoly that "abuses its market dominance at the expense of millions of users who are trying to monetize their own content." He expressed hope that regulators in various jurisdictions will take action "before Apple destroys more dreams and crushes more entrepreneurs."</p><p>The Telegram CEO added that his team is working on ways to provide creators with easy-to-use options to make money from their content. He aims to help them do so "outside of Apple's restrictive ecosystem."</p><p>Telegram introduced paid features in June with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/telegram-premium-subscription-plan-075756557.html"><ins>a $5 per month Premium subscription</ins></a>. That opens up larger file upload sizes, faster downloads, the ability to follow many more channels and the option to pin chats. While the company itself hasn't embraced paid posts as yet, it's intriguing to see creators trying to find their own ways of making money from Telegram — even if Apple isn't too happy about it.</p>

## Apple iPad (2022) review: An expensive facelift

<p>Apple can rarely leave well enough alone. A year ago, I thought each of the four tablets in the iPad lineup was differentiated well from the others, and it was fairly easy to see what features you got as things got more expensive. The new 10th-generation iPad throws a wrench in things, though. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-2022-refresh-preview-130006762.html">It’s a complete redesign</a> from last year’s model that cribs heavily <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-air-5th-generation-review-130019050.html">from the iPad Air</a> while also bringing a handful of compromises to upsell potential customers on Apple’s more expensive tablets.</p><p>But the new iPad also contains a few puzzling decisions and a $120 price hike — the base model now costs $449. Muddying the waters further, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-9th-generation-review-143045685.html">last year’s iPad</a> remains available at $329. And while I think the improvements Apple made to the 10th-generation iPad are significant, I’m not sure how many people in the market for an inexpensive tablet will find these changes worth their cash.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unlike last year’s iPad, which looked essentially identical to the basic tablet Apple has been selling since 2017, this year’s model has been completely redesigned. The Home button is gone, Touch ID has moved to the lock button, the bezels are smaller, the display is bigger, the edges are squared off and the front-facing camera has been moved to the iPad’s landscape edge. It’s a significant set of changes — but only if you haven’t seen an iPad Pro or Air in recent years. Apple has been making tablets with most of these design elements since 2018, so it’s not exactly a fresh look. While it’s slightly thicker and larger than the iPad Air I reviewed earlier this year, it feels essentially identical in the hand, with the exact same size screen.</p><h2>A14</h2><p>Inside the iPad is an A14 Bionic chip (first seen in 2020’s iPhone 12 lineup), a modest update over the A13 in last year’s model. It’s a strong performer, but it wasn’t all that slow to begin with. Of course, if you’re going to raise the price, you had better increase the performance. My modest work needs (Slack, Safari, Google Docs, Todoist, Gmail, etc.) didn’t tax the iPad in the least. Nor did any of the Apple Arcade games I played, and more advanced tasks like editing RAW photos in Lightroom or transcoding and exporting 4K video clips in 1080p were similarly smooth. Sure, the A14 trails the M1 in the iPad Air and the M2 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2022-preview-m2-chip-130006105.html">in the new iPad Pro</a>, but the vast majority of iPad buyers will be plenty happy.</p><p>There is one catch with the A14: this iPad can’t use the new Stage Manager multitasking and window-management features that are in iPadOS 16, as they’re limited to iPad Pro models from 2018 and later or the M1-powered iPad Air.</p><p>As for battery life, Apple continues to meet or exceed its 10-hour estimate it provides for every iPad. This model lasted 11 hours and 45 minutes while playing back a movie purchased from the iTunes Store. I didn’t quite hit 10 hours when using the iPad and its keyboard for work all day long, but it was close enough that I’m not complaining. Of course, more intensive tasks like gaming or editing video will reduce that time significantly.</p><section><img alt="Apple 10th-generation iPad (2022) " class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/eeecd5e0-56c8-11ed-afbf-da862c6700f8" /></section><h2>Screen</h2><p>Compared to last year’s iPad, the screen here is definitely bigger, but not better in any measurable way. It’s the same 10.9 inches as the iPad Air (up from 10.2 inches), and that does make working with multiple apps feel a bit less cramped. And a bigger screen in a body that’s essentially the same size is always a nice improvement. But, this display still lacks a lot of the niceties you’ll find on the Air. Specifically, the display isn’t laminated to the front glass, it’s missing an anti reflective coating and it doesn’t support the P3 wide color gamut.</p><p>These missing features were easier to ignore when it cost $329, but this new iPad only costs $150 less than the Air. That’s not to say this display is bad, but it’s clearly the worst in the iPad lineup — and its deficiencies are a lot more glaring at a higher price. I noticed the air gap between the screen and cover glass less than I expected, but it was a lot more noticeable when I held the iPad in my hands and moved compared to using it with the Magic Keyboard Folio.</p><figure><img alt="Apple 10th-generation iPad (2022) " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/eeecaed0-56c8-11ed-bbb7-2977f153ca27" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Keyboard</h2><p>Speaking of the keyboard, the new iPad has its own redesigned accessory here. The Magic Keyboard Folio is two separate pieces: a back that magnetically attaches and has a kickstand, and a keyboard that attaches to the side of the iPad. It then uses the Smart Connector located on its edge to sync and power the keyboard.</p><p>The folio design has one big deficiency compared to the Magic Keyboard for the iPad Air and Pro. That keyboard is much better for lap typing. The folio, on the other hand, is not nearly as stable on your lap. Fortunately, the typing experience itself is much better than the old Smart Keyboard Cover that works with last year’s iPad. These keys have 1mm of travel, there’s a 14-key function row up top (the first Apple-made iPad keyboard to offer them) and the trackpad is large and responsive. It’s even bigger than the trackpad on the more expensive Magic Keyboard.</p><p>While I don’t care to use a folio-style keyboard on my lap, it was totally fine for long typing sessions at my desk. And the bigger trackpad and function keys are major improvements that I hope to see implemented on other iPad keyboards soon.</p><p>The elephant in the room is that this keyboard costs a truly painful $250; this means that the basic iPad with 64GB of storage and this Magic Keyboard Folio would cost $700. That’s a wild amount of money, and you could get an iPad Air and the second-generation Apple Pencil for just a little bit more, or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-for-students-130054631.html#bestbudgethppavilionaero13">pick up a solid Windows laptop</a> if you’re going to be doing a lot of typing.</p><h2>Cameras</h2><p>Apple also made some significant improvements to the camera system on the new iPad. It now has the same 12-megapixel back camera as the Air. It’s not the best camera out there; as I always say, chances are good the camera on the phone in your pocket is better. But for anyone who wants to shoot video, it now offers 4K capture while last year’s model maxed out at 1080p.</p><p>More significant is the front-facing camera. Oddly enough, it’s exactly the same as last year’s – with one notable exception. Apple finally put the front-facing camera on the landscape edge of the iPad, which means your face will actually be centered if you’re taking a video call with the iPad in its keyboard folio (or just propped up with the kickstand). Amazingly, this iPad is the only one with this feature. The iPad Pro, the best tablet Apple sells, still has its camera on the portrait edge. Basic iPad buyers win out here.</p><section><img alt="Apple 10th-generation iPad (2022) " class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/eeeb9d60-56c8-11ed-bbbe-846848571302" /></section><h2>Pencil</h2><p>As you have already likely noticed, Apple has made some compromises to keep this iPad from infringing too much upon the Air and Pro. Nowhere is that more obvious than the fact that this tablet still uses the first-generation Apple Pencil, introduced way back in 2015. While the original Pencil is still a capable tool for drawing and note-taking, it has a number of issues. It has a built-in Lightning connector on the back; to charge it, you literally plug it into the Lightning port on your iPad (or use a dongle to connect it to a cable). It’s a very awkward setup, compounded by the fact that you can easily lose the cap that covers the charging end of the Pencil. It’s also a perfect circle, which means it rolls away easily, and there’s nowhere to store the Pencil on the iPad itself when you’re not using it.</p><p>All these problems persist. But now, the iPad uses USB-C for charging – which means there’s no Lightning port to plug the Pencil in for charging. Instead, you have to attach the Pencil to a new Lightning to USB-C adapter, plug that mess into a USB-C cable, and then plug <em>that</em> into your iPad. It goes without saying, but: this is far from a good experience. Yes, it’s good that people who have an original Apple Pencil can still use it, but the much-improved second-generation model is the future. It has a flat edge that snaps magnetically onto the side of the iPad for charging and storage, solving all the problems I outlined.</p><p>Every other iPad Apple sells (besides last year’s budget model) uses this accessory now, making this an obvious case of upsell. The second-generation Pencil is <em>so</em> superior to this setup that I would recommend anyone who is interested in using the Apple Pencil just buy the iPad Air instead. For $150 you get a more powerful processor, a significantly better Pencil experience, and a better screen.</p><h2>iPadOS 16</h2><p>iPadOS 16 was just released a few days ago, but I’ve been dabbling with it in beta for months. It’s mostly made of of tweaks that came to iOS 16 a month ago, with features like unsending and editing messages, undo send and scheduling messages in Mail, an iCloud Photo Library you can share with your family members, extensive collaboration features, the ability to copy text straight from a video and a number of other features we’ve covered in the past.</p><p>None of these things fundamentally change the experience of using an iPad, but there are still a number of useful features here. Of course, the one thing that <em>does</em> change the iPad experience is Stage Manager, the new multi-tasking and windowing system. But that’s only available on iPads with the M1 or M2 chip (as well as a few older iPad Pro models). As such, this new iPad is limited to the same Split Screen and Slide Over multitasking capabilities Apple has offered for years now. Given the smaller screen and the fact that Stage Manager is going through some growing pains, this likely won’t be a huge loss for most people.</p><section><img alt="Apple 10th-generation iPad (2022) " class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/eeecfcf0-56c8-11ed-9de3-0116f21cdeb8" /></section><h2>How does it fit?</h2><p>In a vacuum, the new iPad is an obvious improvement over its predecessor in a number of ways. By that measure, it’s probably worth the extra cash Apple is asking for it. A bigger screen, better cameras, a more powerful chip and a more modern design are all solid, and in some cases badly needed updates.</p><p>But putting it in context with the rest of Apple’s iPad lineup makes it a harder sell. If you have an older iPad, you’ll need new accessories, and both the iPad and keyboard folio cost more than older options. And Apple <em>didn’t</em> upgrade the Pencil, which isn’t bad if you already have one — but it’s going to have to cut the cord on the old one at some point, and this would have been a smart time to do so.</p><p>If you want the basic iPad experience and don’t want to spend too much money, last year’s model is still easy to recommend. And if you’re an artist who wants to make extensive use of the Apple Pencil, you’re better off saving up for the iPad Air or Pro.</p><p>This iPad is more like an “Air lite,” and it’s a common strategy for the company. In 2020, Apple took the iPad Pro design and put it in the iPad Air and subsequently bumped the price. Now Apple is doing that again, taking the Air design, putting it in the base model, and making it more expensive. My hope is that within a year or two, Apple adds support for the second-generation Pencil to this model and cuts the price below $400 again. That would make for an iPad that is easy to recommend. But for now, despite a number of improvements, this iPad is sandwiched between two models that probably make more sense for most buyers.</p>

model.</p><p>It's worth noting that Sonos <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-raising-prices-september-12-174153206.html">hiked prices</a> on most of its devices last year, and if you aren't looking for a whole-home audio setup, there are plenty <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-soundbars-143041791.html">other soundbars we like</a> on both the premium and budget ends of the market. Port selection on Sonos devices is typically limited as well. But if you can afford the premium, Sonos speakers still have the benefit of working easily in tandem, with simple setup processes, a polished universal control app, wide <a href="https://support.sonos.com/s/article/3459?language=en_US">streaming service support</a>, room calibration, and Apple AirPlay functionality.&nbsp;</p><p>We've also found the Arc, Beam, Sub, and One SL to offer quality sound for their intended audiences. We gave the top-end Arc and midrange Beam review <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-010039560.html">scores of 85</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-beam-gen-2-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-130024506.html">88</a>, respectively; both technically support Atmos, though the Arc is a bigger 5.0.2-channel bar that will better fill a large room compared to the shorter 5.0-channel Beam. The Sub is undeniably expensive but delivers powerful bass, while the One SL is just the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-18-sonos-one-review.html">excellent Sonos One</a> without built-in microphones (which isn't as much of a problem for smart assistant support when paired with a mic-enabled soundbar).&nbsp;</p><p>With Black Friday around the corner, there's always a chance we'll see more deals before the end of the year. But if you're been thinking of jumping headfirst into a new premium home theater setup, these discounts should lighten the load at least somewhat. If any of the offers above run dry, note that many are also available <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo+Video&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5NTI3NmYzYy03Yjc5LTRjMWUtODAzZi05ODFjZDlmN2E5NjgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmhwaG90b3ZpZGVvLmNvbS9jL2J1eS9zb25vcy1zcGVha2VyLXNldHMvY2kvMzkxMDIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjU3YjJhYTA1LTZiMGUtNGY5Zi04Y2RlLTVjNTQxOGQwYzRkMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATA1nkSHCZoZVKow-WZFVmHf-zQQRAwtHCx9kR3G9DYs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fbuy%2Fsonos-speaker-sets%2Fci%2F39102">at B&amp;H</a> and <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0eee6f60-6f21-4ba6-b70e-cc15b39bf860&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Adorama&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZWVlNmY2MC02ZjIxLTRiYTYtYjcwZS1jYzE1YjM5YmY4NjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWRvcmFtYS5jb20vYnJhbmRzL1Nvbm9zIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1N2IyYWEwNS02YjBlLTRmOWYtOGNkZS01YzU0MThkMGM0ZDAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARGK9jqUvBjDHdUFcULvGi3g2v0y8CtMwOu3fZpJdyE9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fbrands%2FSonos">Adorama</a>.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>

## EU member countries agree to ban sale of gas-powered cars and vans starting in 2035

This is crucial to reach climate neutrality by 2050 and make clean driving more affordable."</p></blockquote><p>Under the deal, new cars from 2030 must also comply with a 55 percent cut on carbon dioxide emissions compared to 2021 levels. Vans must comply with a 50 percent cut. In addition, the agreement states that existing EU funding should be spent on transitioning to zero-emission vehicles and related technologies going forward. The Commission also vows to publish a report every two years detailing the region's progress towards zero-emission road mobility starting in 2025.</p><p>The European Parliament and Council will still have to approve the agreement before it becomes official, and changes could be introduced before then. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/eu-approves-effective-ban-new-fossil-fuel-cars-2035-2022-10-27/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the EU intends to draft a proposal on how to sell cars running on carbon dioxide-neutral fuels after 2035. That said, automakers have been preparing for the shift to zero-emission vehicles for a while now, as governments around the world adopt laws to combat climate change. The list of carmakers pledging to go fully electric over the coming years continue to grow: Ford, for instance, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-will-only-sell-electrified-vehicles-in-europe-by-2030-113015462.html">announced</a> last year that its consumer vehicles will be fully electric by 2030, while GM <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-to-exclusively-sell-zero-emissions-cars-by-2035-164418993.html">aims to eliminate</a> emissions from all its new "light-duty vehicles" by 2035.</p>

## Apple's limited repair commitments are frustrating independent repairers

<p>Apple earned plaudits for making the iPhone 14 more repairable compared to its predecessors, but the question of who can make those repairs remains. It appears the company has added an additional, seemingly-unnecessary layer of friction to the process of replacing a broken display. Much <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-11-iphone-replacement-display-ambient-light-sensor-issue.html">like in 2019</a>, even genuine Apple screens are causing repaired iPhones to malfunction. Sources within the third-party repair community, who have asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, say that while tearing an iPhone 14 may be easier, getting it to work properly after is considerably harder.</p><p>Our sources say the new issue centers on the iPhone 14’s Always-On Display (AOD), which uses the phone’s two Ambient Light Sensors (ALS) to calibrate display brightness. In order to conserve battery life, when at night or when the phone is in your pocket, the display will shut down, leveraging the automatic brightness. If your display breaks, and you don’t use an Apple-authorized service center to replace it, however, the ALS shuts down, leaving the screen permanently black unless you can remember the position of the slider, and then you’ll be stuck manually adjusting your brightness.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>(The Ambient Light Sensor has been an issue with previous iPhone releases, down to where its controller was sited. On the iPhone 12, for instance, it was mounted on a sensor flex itself that leant itself to mechanical failure. On the 13, it was moved to a new component cluster, reducing the risk of it breaking unexpectedly. Our source says that the iPhone 14’s sensor is in a similar place, and so any failure must be a software-related issue.)</p><p>YouTuber Hugh Jefferys posted a video about the problem, swapping the logic board between two brand new iPhones (both for the 14 and 14 Pro). Despite the fact that every component is new and Apple-made, the phones erupted into a chorus of error messages and broken features. FaceID, Battery Health, True Tone and Auto Brightness, as well as the forward-facing cameras are all disabled. When Jeffreys swapped them back, the problems persisted, and the phones were only “fixed” after he had downgraded to iOS 16.0.</p><div id="8f893598567e441db2bd3eef437a30cf"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><div id="b929e1979304422983d1e3fa4f43acbb"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The cause of this failure is Apple’s policy of “Parts Pairing,” tying individual components to the phones that carry them. A display – a commonly broken part – will have a unique ID logged in its hardware that the iPhone checks for whenever it boots. As far as the phone is concerned, it will only work properly if it has its “own” display attached, and if it’s not detected, it won’t work. Users will instead see a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210321"><ins>bunch of error messages</ins></a> urging them to go to their local Apple support technician. These messages will, eventually, stop, but your device will be marked as hosting unauthorized components.</p><p>The only way to prevent this is for an Apple-authorized technician to manually sanction the pairing with an in-house software tool. Our source said that this process requires a technician connecting to Apple’s private network over the internet, a process that is kept “under lock and key” by the company. Until the iPhone 13, there was a workaround for this with third-party repair stores using custom EEPROM programmers. These devices would read the part ID code from the paired display and write it to its replacement, which would often be a refurbished, genuine Apple-made display. Unfortunately, while this worked on previous iPhones, it does not remedy the issues for the iPhone 14.</p><div id="80ef9bb52b80438c85372117d20c46e6"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The result of this is that repair stores outside of Apple’s own network will soon be left unable to make repairs on any new iPhones. The costs of joining Apple’s network, however, are high enough that many businesses have had second thoughts about doing so. “The Independent Repair Programme (IRP) is not profitable enough, as an independent repairer, to maintain as a retail operation” said one individual who asked not to be named.</p><p>Apple has been historically resistant to the idea that users should be able to fix their own gear. It has backed anti-Right to Repair groups and tries to keep all repairs within its own service process. That has led to situations where Apple grossly overcharged for basic repairs that did not require a machine to be sent away to be serviced. The most infamous example, as reported by<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/thenational/complete-control-apple-accused-of-overpricing-restricting-device-repairs-1.4859099"><em><ins>CBC</ins></em></a>, was when a Genius Bar quoted $1,200 to make a fix a third-party store charged $75 for.</p><p>Apple withholds repair manuals and spare parts from third-party stores, despite the volume of iPhones that require basic fixes, like display and battery replacements. Instead, the only non-Apple outfits that can fix iPhones are Authorized Service Providers (ASPs) where Apple can exert some control. The company’s critics say boxing out third parties who can make simple repairs and forcing people back to the Genius Bar helps turn a tidy profit. Apple denies this, and told the <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU05/20190716/109793/HHRG-116-JU05-20190716-SD036.pdf"><ins>US Antitrust subcommittee that in 2019</ins></a>, since 2009, “the costs of providing repair services has exceeded the revenue generated by repairs.” Although Apple did not explain if that constitutes the whole of its repair operations, or just those made under warranty.</p><p>But the company, through a combination of regulator and activist pressure, has been forced to loosen its grip on repairs. In 2019, it said it would allow <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-29-apple-verify-third-party-repair.html"><ins>third-party repair stores</ins></a> to become “verified,” enabling it to receive the same tools, parts and manuals as its ASPs. The process subsequently expanded this program to include Mac repair as well as for iPhones (and iPads). And, on November 17th, 2021, the company announced a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/"><ins>self-service repair program</ins></a> where it would make tools, parts and manuals available to users.</p><p>This process, however, as detailed in depth by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/21/23079058/apple-self-service-iphone-repair-kit-hands-on"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>, revealed that enabling a user to fix their own iPhone display on Apple’s terms wasn’t that easy. The company handed over 79 pounds of tools, including a hot plate to melt the glue holding the display in place. If that wasn’t bad enough, the repair isn’t validated until the iPhone is connected to Apple’s own service team, which can then set the new part as legitimate. And in order to do it, a user has to lay down a deposit of $1,200 to ensure they return the tools within seven days.</p><p>The end result of this is that consumers have to pay a significantly higher price to keep their iPhone running than they should, or could. In one example, a third-party store that used genuine Apple displays charged around £140 ($157) to repair an iPhone 11 display, whereas that same repair at an Apple-authorized store would cost closer to £220 ($247). Compare that to <a href="https://simplyfixit.co.uk/apple-repairs/iphone-repairs/iphone-11/"><ins>aftermarket display</ins></a> replacements, made by third-party companies, which are priced at £95 ($106).</p><p>Jason Eccles is General Manager of SimplyFixIt, a chain of independent repair stores across Scotland. “The idea that someone can buy a device outright, but the manufacturer can still control the functionality of it for years to come is mind-blowing,” he said. “It’s frustrating for us, because we want to offer the best possible repair, but Apple appears to have arbitrary rules around what we can do, sometimes even creating new issues with iOS updates.” Eccles does not have an issue with iOS devices knowing that it was repaired with aftermarket parts, however. “Consumers getting relevant information in iOS that a component has been replaced is a good thing, but I think it’s difficult to say that reducing the functionality of the phone, even if we use genuine parts, is good for customers.”</p><p>Eccles added that it’s important to repair existing equipment from a sustainability standpoint as much as anything else. “We still regularly repair MacBooks and iMacs that are ten years old,” he said, “it shows plenty of Apple devices are out there that would be perfectly usable after a little repair.” Not to mention that responsible independent repair technicians should be welcomed by Apple with open arms. “If everyone had to pay £349 ($403) for a new screen, there would be a lot more people switching to Android for their next phone. Apple might not want to admit it, but we’re helping people stay in their ecosystem.</p><p>iFixit has tested and confirmed the issue to Engadget, saying that there is an issue related to the always-on display. Liz Chamberlain, iFixit Director of Sustainability, said that the practice of using software locks is an “insidious threat to repair as we know it.” And that this new issue is a greater demonstration of the fact that “repairability requires the ability to access software locks, not just hardware.” She added that, either by accident or intention, Apple has “proved [it] can’t be trusted with a parts pairing kill switch.” And that unless lawmakers step in to ensure there is a federally protected right to repair, there’s the possibility that Apple could “disable all phones that have undergone independent repair.”</p><p>Engadget contacted Apple for a comment on the story but none was made available by the time of publication.</p><p>If there’s a hope, it’s that pushes for Right to Repair legislation on both sides of the Atlantic make strong progress. Earlier this year, President Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/01/24/remarks-by-president-biden-before-meeting-with-the-white-house-competition-council/#:~:text=Too%20many%20areas%2C%20if%20you,It's%20broke."><ins>said</ins></a> it was a common problem that a person owns a product, but doesn’t “have the freedom to choose how or where to repair [it.]” And the FTC has recently <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2022/07/ftc-announces-three-right-repair-cases-do-your-warranties-comply-law"><ins>moved to enforce legislation</ins></a> that sees major manufacturers – including Harley Davidson – from using warranty provisions to prevent owners seeking independent repair for their products.</p><p>And the EU, currently taking the lead in many elements of tech regulation, is also looking at laying down better right to repair provisions. Its “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12797-Designing-mobile-phones-and-tablets-to-be-sustainable-ecodesign_en"><ins>Ecodesign</ins></a>” initiative is in its infancy right now, but will focus on producing rules that will ensure devices sold there are more repairable. One of the key clauses in its earliest draft is to provide “appropriate information for users, repairers and recyclers” (Para 4). And that these requirements are designed to enable “repair operations by end-users,” (Para 15), something Apple allows, but doesn’t make easy. We can only hope, that when these rules are agreed, that the balance of power is swung back towards user repair.</p>

<p>This week, Devindra and Deputy Editor Nathan Ingraham dive into Apple’s latest iPad and iPad Pro. The new base iPad seemingly justifies its price, but it also leaves out plenty of consumers who were well-served by the old $329 iPad. We hope that model sticks around for a long while. Also, we discuss if anyone needs M2 power in an iPad Pro (why not just get a MacBook?!), and we prepare for Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter.

<p>After a months-long legal battle that has engulfed Twitter since Elon Musk first offered to buy the company for $44 billion in April, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html">the deal is done</a>, and Musk is already ringing in the changes. Musk, who has criticized Twitter's leadership, fired CEO Parag Agrawal and Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal, as well as several more top executives. He’s also likely to let more staff go, though he has told employees the cuts won't be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-reportedly-wants-to-lay-off-most-of-twitters-employees-222504933.html">as high as 75 percent</a>.</p><p>Musk spent time in Twitter's San Francisco headquarters this week, where he met with employees. <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that he brought in some Tesla engineers to help "assess" Twitter's code.

<p>Lego's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-04-20-gadget-rewind-2006-lego-mindstorms-nxt.html">Mindstorms</a> robotics kits have been on the market since <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1998/04/27/the-joy-of-bricks">1998</a>, born from a collaboration between Lego and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Now, Lego has announced it will be discontinuing Mindstorms at the end of the year and providing support for the mobile app for at least another two years beyond that, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/lego-is-discontinuing-mindstorms-buildable-robot-kits-1849712177"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> has reported.&nbsp;</p><p>Starting as the Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention System over 24 years ago, the kits used Lego's advanced Technics pieces with gears and other robotics parts, powered by the basic "Brick" processing unit. They took a big step forward in 2006 with the introduction of the company's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2006-03-26-lego-mindstorms-nxt-kit-available-for-pre-order-april-1st.html">next generation of Mindstorms kits</a>, dubbed NXT.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another big jump came in 2013 with the EV3 robotics platform. This new lineup was backwards-compatible with the NXT series, offering enhancements to its sensor load and processing power. Lego also launched dedicated mobile apps, turning iOS and Android devices into remote controls for Mindstorms projects. Finally, it set up a Mindstorms community where users could share their creations and collaborate with other builders.</p><p>The last official product was the Robot Inventor lineup from 2020, but with nothing seen since, the writing seemed on the wall for Mindstorms — particularly as Lego was focusing on other educational ventures.&nbsp;</p><p>"Now having a number of priorities in LEGO Education and other Build &amp; Code experiences, we have decided to focus our resources and future plans by redirecting our Mindstorms Robot Inventor team and their expertise into different areas of the business," the company said in a statement to <a href="https://www.brickfanatics.com/lego-discontinuing-mindstorms-end-of-2022/"><em>Brick Fanatics</em></a>. "This means the physical Mindstorms Robot Inventor product (51515) and its related elements (88016 and 88018) are to exit our portfolio from the end of 2022, whilst digital platforms—such as the LEGO Mindstorms Robot Inventor App—will remain live until at least the end of 2024."</p><p>It was one of the first toys to actively promote STEM learning while getting kids and adults alike interested in robotics. (Engadget <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014/09/15/engadget-x-lego-mindstorms/">collaborated</a> with Lego on a Mindstorms robotics contest in 2014.) While it's the end of an era in robotics education, there are now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-robotics-kits-for-beginners/">plenty</a> of kits on the market, including Lego's own <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LEGO&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3MGJjZWVkOC1iMWFlLTRhZjAtOWZkZS1mYWE5MjU4ZTFiYzgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGVnby5jb20vZW4tY2EvcHJvZHVjdC9ib29zdC1jcmVhdGl2ZS10b29sYm94LTE3MTAxIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MmJhNDBiOS0zMjc0LTRjZDEtYjdlZC0yNTc0OWJlY2ZiMjUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXYN0FuhvHA1QNxqpPjTr9gQn7NXX9oVkuYeAVPa8-U5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-ca%2Fproduct%2Fboost-creative-toolbox-17101">Boost robotics kit </a>for beginners.

## Nothing Ear Stick hands-on: Stylish and comfortable, but I miss the noise cancellation

<p>It’s been a busy year for Nothing. After debuting its Ear 1 wireless headphones last year, it followed up with its first smartphone, the Phone 1, daring to compete in an arena that’s actually shed some more established<a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-mobile-worldwide-shutdown-020959355.html"> competitors</a>. Now, it’s tackling wireless buds again with the $99 <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=72705X1521812&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.nothing.tech%2Fproducts%2Fear-stick">Ear Stick</a>. It’s not a great name, but it’s at least descriptive. Instead of the slim, squarish case of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-ear-1-impressions-release-date-price-130026767.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">Ear 1</a>, Nothing has pulled inspiration from cosmetic product design, creating a charging case for the buds inspired by tubes of lipstick. It’s not the first set of wireless headphones to feature a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-31-philips-bassplus-earbuds.html">twisting cylinder</a>, but it ensures the Ear Stick won’t be confused with rival earbuds.</p><p>At $99, the Ear Stick is reasonably priced but lacks some of the significant features of Nothing’s first wireless buds – most crucially, active noise cancellation (ANC). There are plenty of improvements here, though, especially concerning connectivity.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><h3>The hardware</h3><figure><img alt="Nothing Ear Sticks hands-on" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/18057730-5605-11ed-979b-0de28aa3e45d" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>It’s hard to stop twisting and pawing at the Ear Stick’s eye-catching case. The micro-dotted surface of the charger, exposed when the buds are locked in and charging, feels nice. At the top of the charger, there’s a USB-C charging port and a chrome button for pairing the buds to devices. Given the form factor, there’s no wireless charging this time around, but it also ensures the Ear Stick is cheaper to make. (As it is, Nothing recently raised the price on its Ear One buds.) There is a sliver of space on the case, though, so pocket lint can easily get trapped and rolled into the crevice, which is annoying. Judging by my other transparent gadgets, this might only get worse.</p><p>The Ear Stick buds themselves continue that Nothing design language, with transparent casing around the tips and a dot-matrix font labeling each stem. There’s a red dot on the right bud to help users ensure they go in the right ears. However, compared to the Ear 1, they don’t have silicone tips, so they rest loosely inside the ear. This means that, regardless of any noise cancellation technology, a good amount of noise will seep in.</p><p>Nothing says the buds went through over 200 rounds of modifications, and I think it was worth it: They’re comfortable. Weighing in at 4.4 grams (0.15 ounces) each, they’re also lighter than the Ear 1 buds. I know that many people (and several Engadget editors) prefer this kind of looser fit, as AirPods Pro, Galaxy Buds and many others put a little too much pressure on their ear canals. The Ear Stick is aimed at those people – but are there enough of them?</p><p>In noisy environments – say, when traveling on public transport or working out – I’m forced to crank the volume up to max to compete with all the ambient noise. That said, they are comfortable and, for buds without removable tips, snug enough not to fear losing them when on the move. I still wasn’t completely at ease running or jumping in them, but they didn’t fall out during regular use.</p><p>I haven’t extensively tested the battery life yet, but Nothing’s seven-hour rating seems roughly accurate. Expect to get 29 hours of total playback with the case, which is almost a week of intermittent listening for me. There’s a fast-charge function that can juice the buds with two hours of playback with only 10 minutes of charge time, which has already been convenient during long trips across London, where I’m based.</p><p>Nothing also made a new custom-designed dynamic driver in this generation of buds. The company claims it’s the most sensitive one found on wireless buds in the market, and while I can’t vouch for that, I did find that the Ear Stick performs best when I’m listening to spoken word or on phone calls; they’re notably clearer and crisper sounding than the Ear 1. Additionally, Nothing says it’s packed in a Bass Lock feature that tries to gauge sound leaking from the half-open design, but I struggle to hear it make enough for all of the sound loss.</p><p>However, there’s not much Nothing can do with a half-ear design like this to maintain bass levels in comparison to the competition. There’s a tinniness to music and sounds that I don’t think any algorithm can fix, given the half-open bud design.</p><p></p><h3>The software</h3><h3></h3><p>You can ameliorate this a little with the customizable equalizer from the companion app, and if you’re already a Nothing Phone 1 user, you’ll get handy shortcuts from the Android drop-down menu. It’s a nice touch, matching the slickness you get when using Samsung buds with a Galaxy phone, etc.</p><figure><img alt="Nothing Ear Sticks hands-on" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/180ace60-5605-11ed-bbf7-1802dae47088" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>Nothing has also addressed some of the connectivity issues that marred the Ear 1. It’s moved the antenna further down the buds, which it says minimizes signal blockage. In use, the Ear Stick connects and pairs more consistently than Nothing’s other headphones. They’re less likely to drop connection when I move around my apartment and get farther away from my phone. The Stick is also much less fussy about pairing with phones, laptops and other devices. While I was initially impressed with the Ear 1, its inconsistency pairing to iPhones, laptops and even Android phones meant I eventually changed back to my AirPods Pro. Nothing has fortunately learned that lesson with its second pair of wireless buds.</p><p>I’d happily take the audio and signal improvements of the Stick, but unfortunately, I’m just not as enamored with the Ear Stick as I was with the Ear 1. I need my noise cancellation and silicone tips. However, I am looking forward to Ear 2, or whatever Nothing decides to call its third attempt, when it hopefully combines the best of both buds.</p><p></p>

## The iPhone 15 Pro may feature haptic solid-state volume and power buttons

<p>The next-gen iPhone 15 Pro models may swap its physical volume and power buttons for solid state versions that use haptic feedback, analyst Min-Chi Kuo wrote in a <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1585852274680950784">tweet</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/28/kuo-iphone-15-pro-models-solid-state-buttons/"><em>MacRumors</em></a>. The design would be similar to the non-physical home button on the iPhone 7, which used a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-16-iphone-7-plus-teardown-ifixit.html">Taptic Engine</a> to simulate a button press with vibrations. It could also resemble Mac trackpads, which don't move but simulate clicks using similar haptic technology.&nbsp;</p><p>Making this work would require additional Taptic Engines on top of the one already in current iPhone models. "There will be Taptic Engines located on the internal left and right sides to provide force feedback to make users feel like they are pressing physical buttons," said Kuo in a tweet thread. "Due to this design change, the number of Taptic Engines used in each iPhone will increase from the current one to three."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0a2e46b534ba45b49f3c56c68435a268"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">(1/6)<br />My latest survey indicates that the volume button and power button of two high-end iPhone 15/2H23 new iPhone models may adopt a solid-state button design (similar to the home button design of iPhone 7/8/SE2 &amp; 3) to replace the physical/mechanical button design.</p>— 郭明錤 (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1585852274680950784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>Apple was reportedly planning a similar change for the Watch to increase water resistance, according to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-08-apple-watch-buttons.html">2018 rumor</a>, but it never happened. It's not clear how a buttonless design would benefit an iPhone, though, as it seems like two additional Taptic Engines would add rather than reduce complexity (a large part of the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/65598/apple-watch-ultra-is-beautiful-rugged-and-repairability-is-just-within-reach#:~:text=The%20Ultra's%20Taptic%20Engine%20turns,6.4%20g%20Series%208%20Engine.">Watch Ultra's heft</a> is due to the massive Taptic Engine).</p><p>Kuo said that the buttonless design and switch to USB-C (which Apple already confirmed) would be two of the major changes for the next iPhone Pro models. Kuo is often right about such things, but the iPhone 15 models are still a year away, so a lot can change in the meantime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the years, we've seen smartphone charging speeds going from the already-impressive 30 minutes down to 15 minutes, but apparently that's still too slow for Xiaomi. In the new <a href="https://www.mi.com/global/discover/article?id=2802">Redmi Note 12 lineup</a> unveiled earlier today, one model dubbed "Redmi Note 12 Discovery Edition" stood out with a whopping 210W HyperCharge capability. This feature is controlled by three 100W fast charging chips, which fully charge the phone's 4,300mAh battery in just 9 minutes. To put things into perspective, both Xiaomi's earlier <a href="https://www.engadget.com/redmi-10-5g-redmi-note-11-pro-plus-5g-120w-hypercharge-124520823.html">120W HyperCharge</a> and Oppo's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-150w-supervooc-oneplus-140004546.html">150W SuperVOOC</a> need 15 minutes to juice up a 4,500mAh battery.</p><p>The Redmi Note 12 Discovery Edition also sees the debut of MediaTek's mid-range Dimensity 1080 processor, and it's completed with a 6.67-inch OLED screen (2,400 x 1,080, 120Hz), a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-12t-pro-200mp-camera-pricing-availability-130236719.html">200MP</a> main camera (Samsung's brand new HPX sensor; with OIS), an 8MP ultra-wide camera, a 2MP macro camera and a 16MP selfie camera. You'll also find dual-SIM slots, dual speakers, a 3.5mm headphone jack, an in-display fingerprint sensor, NFC, and an infrared blaster on this Android 12 device.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for RAM and storage, this model only comes with one combo: 8GB LPDDR4x RAM and 256GB UFS 2.2 storage. Unlike last year's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/redmi-10-5g-redmi-note-11-pro-plus-5g-120w-hypercharge-124520823.html">Redmi Note 11 Pro+</a>, microSD expansion is missing here, which may be a deterrent for those who are considering an upgrade. Still, not bad for 2,399 yuan or $330.</p><figure><img alt="Redmi Note 12 Pro+ series" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/166f14c0-567e-11ed-9fbf-7eca9ab8019a" style="height: 1000; width: 1600;" /><figcaption>From left to right: white, black, blue versions of the Redmi Note 12 Pro+, as well as the Redmi Note 12 Discovery Edition and Redmi Note 12 Yibo Edition (a collaboration with Chinese artist Wang Yibo).</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>Despite the name, the Redmi Note 12 Discovery Edition is actually based on the Redmi Note 12 Pro+, with the main difference being the lesser charging power (120W) but bigger battery (5,000mAh) for the latter. This model starts from 2,199 yuan or about $304, which comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage; or you can pay 2,399 yuan or around $331 to bump the RAM up to 12GB.</p><p>Then there's also the lesser but similar-looking Redmi Note 12 Pro, which swaps the 200MP main camera for a 50MP one (using Sony's IMX766 sensor), and it only uses 67W charging for the same 5,000mAh battery. This starts from 1,699 yuan or about $235, which gets you 6GB of RAM with 128GB of storage; and you can max out at 12GB of RAM with 256GB of storage for the price of 2,199 yuan or around $304 — the same as the Pro+'s starting price, interestingly.</p><figure><img alt="Redmi Note 12" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/094d7bc0-5687-11ed-aedf-f95f4d9f944f" style="height: 1000; width: 1600;" /><figcaption>Redmi Note 12</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>Last but not least, the Redmi Note 12 is positioned as an affordable smartphone, starting at 1,199 yuan or about $166. It packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 chipset, a slightly lesser-grade OLED display of the same size (mainly lower brightness and contrast, as well as the lack of HDR support), less powerful cameras (48MP main, 2MP depth sensor and 8MP front), weaker charging power (33W) and just a mono speaker. In terms of variants, it starts from 4GB of RAM with 128GB of storage, going all the way up to 8GB with 256GB, respectively (1,699 yuan or around $235; same as the Note 12 Pro's base price).</p><p>As with recent Redmi phones, there's a good chance that these new models will make their way to international markets later, so we'll be keeping an eye out for further updates.</p>

## Minnesota and DC sue Target-owned Shipt delivery service for worker misclassification

<p>The Minnesota and District of Columbia attorneys general are suing Target-owned Shipt delivery service over worker misclassification, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/lawsuit-shipt-misclassified-workers-employment-protection/"><em>CBS News</em></a> has reported. The lawsuits accuse the company of designating its "personal shoppers" (who pick and deliver grocery orders) as independent contractors to avoid paying benefits like state unemployment insurance and worker's compensation.&nbsp;</p><p>"Increasingly, we’re seeing companies abuse hard-working District residents by fraudulently calling them independent contractors and, as a result, denying them wages and benefits they are legally owed," said DC AG&nbsp;Karl Racine in a statement.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Shipt said it disagrees with the allegation and that most of its workers prefer being able to set their own hours. "Shoppers with Shipt are independent contractors, and the flexibility that comes with being an independent contractor is the primary reason Shipt Shoppers choose to earn on our platform," spokesperson Evangeline George told <em>CBS News</em>. Citing its own survey, it said that 80 percent of its workers named such flexibility as a key priority.</p><p>However, Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison said the company controls "virtually every facet of a shopper's work" despite claiming the workers are independent. "Unlike other employees, these workers have no clarity on how much they will be paid day to day, and they often don't receive the minimum wage and overtime they're entitled to," he added.&nbsp;</p><p>The suits seek to recover paid sick leave owed, unpaid wages, payments owed for unemployment insurance, penalties and more. Other delivery companies including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/door-dash-faces-lawsuit-from-san-francisco-da-over-worker-classification-034939022.html">DoorDash</a> have faced similar actions, and Instacart recently agreed to <a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/online-retail/instacart-pay-465-million-settlement-over-gig-worker-dispute">pay $46.5 million</a> in a settlement with the city of San Diego over misclassified workers. Earlier this year, Massachusetts <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-lyft-lawsuit-massachusetts-181649594.html">sued Uber and Lyft</a> for identifying drivers as contractors.&nbsp;</p><p></p>

## Elon Musk has begun his takeover of Twitter

<p>After months of legal drama, Elon Musk has begun his takeover of Twitter,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-completes-twitter-takeover-11666918031?mod=hp_lead_pos1"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/10/27/twitter-elon-musk/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a><em>. </em>His first move was to fire CEO Parag Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal and other top execs.</p><p>Musk is taking the reins just ahead of a Friday deadline to complete the deal. The deal's closing will bring to an end the months-long legal battle that has engulfed Twitter since Musk first offered to buy the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-offers-to-buy-twitter-for-43-billion-104642696.html">in April</a>, before announcing a couple weeks later that the acquisition was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-his-deal-to-buy-twitter-is-temporarily-on-hold-105457845.htmlv">“on hold.”</a> Musk, who declined to do due diligence before his offer, cited concerns about the number of bots and fake accounts on the platform. Twitter’s lawyers later argued that the bot issue was merely <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-musk-hearing-whistleblower-230213240.html">a “pretext”</a> for him to renege on the deal.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But finalizing the acquisition will be far from the end of turmoil within Twitter. Musk, who has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-disparage-twitter-employees-224616582.html">criticized </a>Twitter's leadership and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-messages-jack-dorsey-parag-agrawal-000254423.html">clashed</a> with Agrawal, has already fired at least four executives, including Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's top policy official, and Sean Edgett, the company's general counsel. <em>The New York Times</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/musk-twitter.html">reported</a> that "at least one" executive was escorted from Twitter's office on Thursday.</p><p>Musk, who changed his Twitter bio to “Chief Twit,” has made it clear he intends to bring big changes to the social media company. He has said both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-ted-181607962.html">in public</a> appearances and in <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/07/1127337447/heres-what-elon-musk-will-likely-do-with-twitter-if-he-buys-it">private messages</a> that he wants to relax Twitter’s moderation rules and that he dislikes permanent bans. He’s also likely to cut staff, though he has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-wont-layoff-75-percent-of-staff-122948434.html">told employees</a> he won’t cut <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-reportedly-wants-to-lay-off-most-of-twitters-employees-222504933.html">75 percent</a> of employees as he was reportedly considering.</p><p>Twitter’s core service could also dramatically change under Musk’s leadership. In addition to loosening moderation rules on the platform, Musk has said wants to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-ted-181607962.html">“open source”</a> Twitter’s algorithm so users could better understand its recommendations. At the same time, he’s tried to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-advertisers-hellscape-172909516.html">reassure advertisers</a> that he doesn’t want the site to be a “free-for-all hellscape,” and that Twitter should be the “most respected advertising platform in the world.”</p><p>Musk, who has often talked about his desire for Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1577428272056389633">to be</a> “an accelerant to creating X, the everything app” akin <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/10/06/musk-super-everything-app-vision-twitter-wechat">to WeChat </a>in China, is also likely to look for ways to increase non-advertising revenue. He’s proposed changes to <a href="https://twitter.com/karissabe/status/1575592976822116352">Twitter Blue</a>, and floated the idea of charging companies for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-tweet-embeds-charge-173354164.html">tweet embeds</a>.</p><p><em>Developing…</em></p>
