Wait, stop, I can hear you typing out a letter to the editor right now. Address it to Gordon Mah Ung, because this take belongs to him. Why could one of the most beloved CPU socket designs ever be bad for AMD? You&rsquo;ll need to watch the latest PCWorld video to find out. </p>

</div></figure><p>If you&rsquo;re short on time, here&rsquo;s the gist: Gordon says that customers who may be using hardware as old as the original Zen gen 1 processors from 2017 aren&rsquo;t in any hurry to jump to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1074246/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the new AM5 platform and Ryzen 7000 processors</a>, fantastic as these new designs are. Why would they want to buy a new motherboard, new RAM, and new processor, when they can toss a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/701130/tested-the-ryzen-7-5800x3ds-astonishing-performance-shows-how-far-amds-ryzen-has-come.html">Ryzen 7 5800X3D</a> onto their dusty motherboard, and still get a massive performance increase for just $350 or so? </p>

<p>Perhaps the bigger problem for AMD is those customers who <em>are </em>ready to upgrade. After all, if you&rsquo;re prepared to spend over a thousand bucks on a new CPU, motherboard, and RAM&hellip;then there&rsquo;s nothing stopping you from jumping over to the Intel side of things to check out what&rsquo;s new in the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357979/intel-core-i9-13900k-review.html">ferocious 13th-gen Core series</a>. Intel has apparently recognized AMD as a legitimate threat, and is competing on both raw core counts and prices once again. </p>



<p>These options are great for consumers, but they might not work out great for AMD in the long run. In fact, it might be such a strategic disadvantage that it causes AMD to rethink its upgrade-friendly approach. (The company has committed to making new processors for AM5 through 2025.)

## 20 terrifying PC horror games to play with the lights off

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Horror games are a dime a dozen. Scary&nbsp;horror games,&nbsp;<em>good</em>&nbsp;horror games&mdash;well, those are much rarer. We&rsquo;ve rounded up some of the best horror games ever made, running the gamut from big-budget extravaganzas released this very year to&hellip; text adventures. Yes, seriously.</p>



<p>Turn out the lights, put on some headphones, make sure you&rsquo;ve got a spare pair of underwear nearby, and enjoy these terrifying spine-tinglers.</p>



<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: This list was updated on October 28, 2022 to add several new games and remove some older titles. Hayden Dingman and Adam Patrick Murray contributed extensively to this article</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="phasmophoria" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/10/phasmophoria-100863258-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p>Like&nbsp;<em>Left 4 Dead</em>,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html">Phasmophobia</a>&nbsp;</em>is a first-person, 4-person horror coop game. But while Valve&rsquo;s undead shooter leans into action with guns a-blazing,&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>takes a more classical approach to terror. You control a tiny team of paranormal ghost hunters, traveling to various locations and using an array of equipment (from UV blacklights to EMF readers) to try to identify the type of spook haunting the house, and where they&rsquo;re lurking. The places are dark. The ghosts are&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;friendly.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s already the best ghost game I&rsquo;ve ever played, even in its current slightly janky early access form. The tricks it pulls using the in-game voice chat can be truly terrifying. Turn off the lights, grab some friends, and don&rsquo;t miss out.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Back 4 Blood" class="wp-image-547522" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/back-4-blood.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Turtle Rock</p></div>



<p>Speaking of &ldquo;Like <em>Left 4 Dead,</em>&rdquo; <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/924970/Back_4_Blood/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Back 4 Blood</a></em> is a cooperative first-person shooter where you and three buddies (or AI companions) blast through hordes of zombies, including special versions with meaner abilities. Sound familiar? It should&mdash;the game&rsquo;s even made by Turtle Rock, the developer behind <em>Left 4 Dead</em>. A new card system adds a random element to the game that can turn situations on their heads (for better or worse) and amps up the replayability. </p>



<p>The player base has dwindled a bit since release, but if you&rsquo;ve been feeling nostalgic for the <em>L4D</em> feel of yesteryear, grab some buddies and saddle up. Better yet, <em>Back 4 Blood </em>is included in Microsoft&rsquo;s excellent Xbox Games Pass for PC, so you might not even spend a dime to get in on the fun.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="The Medium" class="wp-image-547561" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/the-medium.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Bloober Team</p></div>



<p>What happens when you pair up the developers behind horror classics like <em>Layers of Fear</em>, <em>Observer</em>, and <em>Blair Witch</em> with <em>Silent Hill</em> veteran Akira Yamaoka contributing music, then top it all off with a cutting-edge real-time ray tracing graphics engine? You get <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293160/The_Medium/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">The Medium</a></em>, a truly dark and disturbing third person adventure where you play as a psychic who travels (sometimes in real time) between the real world and the spirit world to solve a mystery in an abandoned eastern Europe resort town. This one will stress your PC hardware as well as your psyche.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Chernobylite" class="wp-image-547562" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/chernobylite.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Chernobylite</p></div>



<p>Not only is the idea of exploring the famous nuclear disaster site Chernobyl scary in itself, but imagine if there were supernatural creatures roaming around as well? <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1016800/Chernobylite/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Chernobylite</a></em> feels like a sci-fi horror version of <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> or <em>Metro</em> set in&nbsp;Chernobyl&rsquo;s excursion zone as you try to track down what happened to your fiancee 30 years ago. It&rsquo;s a stealth based FPS with some interesting base building and choose-your-own-adventure-style storytelling in a package I&rsquo;ve never experienced before, and I love it.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="amnesia rebirth" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/10/amnesia-rebirth-100863259-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p>Over a decade after its debut, Frictional&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Amnesia</em>&nbsp;series remain some of the most truly spine-tingling horror games available. This year, Frictional delivered a treat just in time for Halloween.&nbsp;<em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/999220/Amnesia_Rebirth/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html">Amnesia Rebirth</a></em>&nbsp;takes place in the Algerian desert in 1937, putting you in the shoes of Tasi Trianon, who&mdash;of course&mdash;wakes up with no memory. The game&rsquo;s developers call it &ldquo;A harrowing journey through desolation and despair, exploring the limits of human resilience.&rdquo; Better yet,&nbsp;<em>Rebirth</em>&nbsp;is a direct follow-up to the legendary&nbsp;<em>Dark Descent</em>, and some of the locales give off strong&nbsp;<em>Soma&nbsp;</em>vibes&mdash;two games we&rsquo;ll talk about more later. &nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="blair witch" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/10/blair-witch-100814627-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p>Bloober Team puts out damned creepy games, but the one I&rsquo;m more enamored with isn&rsquo;t a great fit for this list.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3397842/layers-of-fear-2-review.html"><em>Layers of Fear 2&nbsp;</em>is a masterpiece of art direction</a>, a brilliant homage to classic Hollywood that I highly recommend&mdash;but it&rsquo;s not scary.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1092660/Blair_Witch/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html"><em>Blair Witch</em></a>&nbsp;is pretty tense though. Taking on the found footage aesthetic of the films, you play as an ex-cop who joins a missing persons search&mdash;and ends up (as you&rsquo;d expect) hopelessly lost in the woods. As ever, Bloober&rsquo;s got a neat gimmick to go with the action, scrubbing through film clips to change the state of the world. That&rsquo;s a side course though. Really, this one&rsquo;s just about the tension of being alone in a forest labyrinth, with no way out. Sometimes the simple concepts are the scariest, yeah?</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="pathologic 2" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/10/pathologic-2-100814631-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p>A remake of Ice Pick Lodge&rsquo;s 2004 oddity&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>, pseudo-sequel&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/505230/Pathologic_2/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html"><em>Pathologic 2</em></a>&nbsp;preserves much of the original&rsquo;s subtle horror. There&rsquo;s a city. There&rsquo;s a plague. There&rsquo;s never enough time.</p>



<p>And sure, there are more traditional horror elements&mdash;cryptic speeches, otherworldly entities. It&rsquo;s more about the&nbsp;<em>experience</em>&nbsp;though. Playing as &ldquo;The Haruspex,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re ill-equipped to unravel&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2</em>&lsquo;s mysteries, and that&rsquo;s part of the draw. If horror games are about making the player feel weak and powerless, then&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2</em>&nbsp;is one of the most successful horror games of all time. Every success is hard-won, and any fleeting catharsis like a breath of fresh air for a dying man.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="resident evil 2 remake" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/10/resident-evil-2-remake-100814632-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p><em>Resident Evil 2</em>&nbsp;was one of the more neglected&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>&nbsp;entries. Whereas both the debut and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>&nbsp;have been remastered and even remade time and again,&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2</em>&nbsp;was left to languor on the PlayStation for two decades.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3335258/resident-evil-2-2019-review.html">Capcom did right by it though</a>. The&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/883710/Resident_Evil_2/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html"><em>Resident Evil 2</em>&nbsp;remake</a>&nbsp;is the bar for any and all remakes going forward, transplanting the story and atmosphere of the original into a modern engine. A map that tracks your per-room progress is one of many smart tweaks here, as is ditching the iconic (but annoying) save ribbons for all but the hardest difficulties.</p>



<p>Since this remake came out, <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/418370/Resident_Evil_7_Biohazard/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil VII</a> </em>brought pure horror in a single bleak location back to the series, while <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1196590/Resident_Evil_Village/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil VIIIage</a> </em>(sigh) revived the clockwork puzzle feel of the earlier games. There was also a <em>Resident Evil 3 Remake</em> that wasn&rsquo;t quite as successful. But if you&rsquo;ve only got time for one <em>RE</em> game this Halloween season, start with <em>Resident Evil 2 Remake</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="observation" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/10/observation-100814630-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p>No Code&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3244244/best-pc-games-2017.html"><em>Stories Untold</em></a>&nbsp;created horror from the mundane, nightmares unfolding while you spooled through microfiche or adjusted the dials on an X-ray machine.&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/906100/Observation/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html"><em>Observation</em></a>&nbsp;is slightly more active, but retains that analog feel. This time you&rsquo;re aboard a spaceship in Saturn&rsquo;s orbit&mdash;or rather, you&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;the spaceship. You&rsquo;re S.A.M., the ship&rsquo;s artificial intelligence, only afforded a window on the world through your various security cameras.</p>



<p>I still think No Code described it best in their first pitch, when they said &ldquo;<em>Observation</em>&nbsp;is kind of&nbsp;<em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>&mdash;but you&rsquo;re HAL.&rdquo; Combine that with some&nbsp;<em>Annihilation</em>-esque cosmic horror, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3396640/observation-review-science-fiction.html">you&rsquo;ve got all the makings of an unsettling slow burn</a>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="control review" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/10/control-review-100814629-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p>Another one for fans of New Weird,&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/870780/Control_Ultimate_Edition/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html"><em>Control&nbsp;</em></a>certainly isn&rsquo;t the most traditional horror game. Hell, it&rsquo;s not even the most traditional horror game made by Remedy. That&rsquo;d be&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake</em>, of course.</p>



<p>But&nbsp;<em>Control</em>&nbsp;draws a lot of inspiration from&nbsp;<em>The Southern Reach Trilogy</em>, from SCP Foundation, from&nbsp;<em>House of Leaves</em>, from&nbsp;<em>The X-Files</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Twin Peaks&mdash;</em>in other words, from a lot of sources that are horror or at least horror-adjacent. It&rsquo;s rarely scary but it&rsquo;s almost always creepy, a pervasive sense of wrongness that arises from every empty office, every blank concrete wall, and&hellip;well, probably from the people floating motionless in the air as well.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s the type of horror that sits in the back of your mind, like the veil of the world&rsquo;s been torn back just a bit to reveal the abyss gazing through.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3434060/control-review-so-good-you-might-finally-stop-asking-for-alan-wake-2.html">And that&rsquo;s very special indeed</a>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="man of medan" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/10/man-of-medan-100814628-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p>In 2015 Supermassive adapted Telltale&rsquo;s style of branching cinematic storytelling to the horror genre. The result? PlayStation 4 exclusive&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, a surprisingly entertaining pulp horror tale about a bunch of ill-fated teens.</p>



<p>Luckily follow-up&nbsp;<em>The Dark Pictures Anthology</em>&nbsp;is funded by Bandai Namco, and thus free to come to the PC as well. The first chapter is&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/939850/The_Dark_Pictures_Anthology_Man_of_Medan/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html"><em>Man of Medan</em></a>, which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3434577/man-of-medan-review-five-friends-a-haunted-ship-and-plenty-of-ways-to-die.html">retells the story of the real-world ghost ship Ourang Medan</a>&mdash;albeit from the perspective of a fresh group of ill-fated twenty-somethings. It&rsquo;s part adventure game and part film, as you make dialogue choices and decisions that could keep your characters alive, or result in everyone&rsquo;s death.</p>



<p>The writing is fairly predictable, and some of the acting a bit wooden, but it&rsquo;s still a fun time trying to outsmart everyone&rsquo;s favorite horror tropes. And whatever you do,&nbsp;<em>don&rsquo;t open the coffins</em>. What, are you&nbsp;<em>trying</em>&nbsp;to end up dead?</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="dusk" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/10/dusk-100778202-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p>New Blood&rsquo;s carved out a neat little niche, creating not just retro-inspired shooters but ones that are vaguely horror-inspired as well.&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/519860/DUSK/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html"><em>Dusk</em></a>&nbsp;takes you through sinister farms and abandoned cityscapes,&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/673130/AMID_EVIL/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html"><em>Amid Evil</em></a>&nbsp;to much weirder fantasy environs. But both are about moving a million miles an hour, shooting anything that moves, and opening a bunch of locked doors. Scary? Maybe not so much&mdash;but only because you have more than enough weapons to defend yourself from all the horrors that await.</p>



<p>If that&rsquo;s not enough,&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1010750/Blood_Fresh_Supply/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html"><em>Blood: Fresh Supply</em>&nbsp;</a>remasters one of New Blood&rsquo;s inspirations. Might as well grab all three and get gibbing.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="evil within 2" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/10/evil-within-2-100739495-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p>The first&nbsp;<em>Evil Within</em>&nbsp;was a mess of a game. Oh sure, it had brilliant ideas, but the execution was just&nbsp;<em>dismal</em>&nbsp;at times&mdash;clunky movement, a tedious and poorly paced opening, and a save system that caused more than one person I know to quit after a few hours.</p>



<p>But&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/601430/The_Evil_Within_2/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html"><em>The Evil Within 2</em></a>&nbsp;is excellent&mdash;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3244244/best-pc-games-2017.html">one of 2017&rsquo;s best games</a>, even. The more open-world structure of some acts takes a bit of getting used to, but its more story-driven bits are home to jaw-dropping spectacle: people&rsquo;s last moments frozen in time, unsettling architecture, supernatural hallucinations. All the ideas that made the first game worth the grind are back, and paired with a game that actually plays well this time.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="dead by daylight" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/10/dead-by-daylight-100739493-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p>Once upon a time this slide was a battle between&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Friday the 13th</em>, two horror games with a similar conceit: Asymmetric multiplayer, where four survivors have to band together and hold out while another player, the powerful monster, tries to kill them off. &ldquo;Think&nbsp;<em>Evolve</em>, but for sadists,&rdquo; I wrote.</p>



<p>But&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html"><em>Dead by Daylight</em></a>&nbsp;is your only option now. The&nbsp;<em>Friday the 13th</em>&nbsp;game got caught up in the ongoing lawsuit over the series rights, with the developers pretty much abandoning and saying &ldquo;no new content&rdquo; would be forthcoming. Rest in peace, and all. You can still buy it on Steam, but you&rsquo;re better off sticking with&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="alien isolation" src="https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2014/10/alien-isolation-100526667-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p>One alien. That was the design direction behind Creative Assembly&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/214490/Alien_Isolation/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html"><em>Alien: Isolation</em></a>, which pursued the survival horror mood of the original 1979 film instead of the action-packed plot of&nbsp;<em>Aliens</em>.</p>



<p>And it worked. Though a bit overlong and at times needlessly difficult,&nbsp;<em>Alien: Isolation</em>&nbsp;is the strongest big-budget horror experience in years. This game is just plain&nbsp;<em>tense&mdash;</em>almost unbearably so if you&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2824536/become-ripley-hackers-unlock-alien-isolations-hidden-oculus-rift-vr-support.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">play it with a VR headset</a>. And it&rsquo;s&nbsp;available for Linux, Steam Machines, and OS X, too.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="soma" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/10/soma-100739506-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p><em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/282140/SOMA/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html">SOMA</a>&nbsp;</em>isn&rsquo;t the scariest game Frictional&rsquo;s ever made. It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s barely a horror game for long stretches at a time, and the monsters are more hindrance than terror.</p>



<p>But the underwater confines of PATHOS-II are often unnerving, what with the groans of pressurized metal and the flickering lights and the robots that seem to believe they&rsquo;re still human.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2984981/software-games/soma-review-ghostly-machines-beneath-the-sea-exploring-humanitys-depths.html">It&rsquo;s a strong experience</a>, and one well worth playing even if it won&rsquo;t make you leap out of your seat.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="amnesia dark descent" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/10/amnesia-dark-descent-100739491-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p>Now we&rsquo;re digging into Frictional&rsquo;s truly great scares. A Victorian-era castle may not seem like the best setting for a horror game, but with&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/57300/Amnesia_The_Dark_Descent/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html"><em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent&nbsp;</em></a>Frictional took everything it learned from its earlier games, polished it, and released one of the scariest games of all time. You play as Daniel, an archeologist who&rsquo;s lost his memory and has only a letter&mdash;apparently written by him&mdash;to guide his escape from the mad castle and shadowy figures that stalk him.</p>



<p>As of 2018,&nbsp;<em>Amnesia</em>&lsquo;s also been updated with a new difficulty level, harder than before. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it for new players, as true horror&rsquo;s found in thinking you&nbsp;<em>might</em>&nbsp;die and then escaping. But for veterans, it&rsquo;s great to have a reason to revisit the castle.</p>



<p>And while it&rsquo;s more polarizing, the sequel&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/239200/Amnesia_A_Machine_for_Pigs/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html"><em>Machine for Pigs&nbsp;</em></a>is worth checking out, as long as you curb your expectations.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="doki doki literature club" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/10/doki-doki-literature-club-100778204-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p>Part of the appeal of&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html"><em>Doki Doki Literature Club</em></a>&nbsp;is not&nbsp;<em>knowing</em>&nbsp;it&rsquo;s a horror game when you go into it, so it feels a bit like a betrayal to put it on here, a &ldquo;Best Horror Games&rdquo; list.</p>



<p>But even knowing there&rsquo;s a twist coming,&nbsp;<em>Doki Doki Literature Club&nbsp;</em>is still a smart horror experience that pulls some unsettling tricks on the player. Better yet, it&rsquo;s free, so even if you&rsquo;re not big into the visual novel genre normally (I&rsquo;m not) you won&rsquo;t risk much by downloading it and giving it a try.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="outlast" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/10/outlast-100739499-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p>Asylums are easy fodder for horror. That said,&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/238320/Outlast/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html"><em>Outlast</em></a>&nbsp;makes the most of its clich&eacute;d setting by providing you no way to defend yourself and forcing you into the found-footage conceit popularized by horror films like&nbsp;<em>Blair Witch Project</em>. The game has some pacing issues, but it&rsquo;s definitely not for the faint of heart&mdash;gore and jump scares abound.</p>



<p>And if you already played and enjoyed the base&nbsp;<em>Outlast&nbsp;</em>game, be sure to check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/273300/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Whistleblower</a>&nbsp;DLC released last year.&nbsp;<em>Outlast 2</em>?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3193037/gaming/outlast-2-review-fear-turns-to-frustration.html">Not so much</a>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="stasis" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/10/stasis-100739507-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p>It&rsquo;s a point-and-click, but&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/380150/STASIS/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html"><em>Stasis</em></a>&nbsp;has atmosphere in spades. You wake up on a strange spaceship, surrounded by bodies, and it only gets worse from there.</p>



<p>Styled after the classic isometric horror game&nbsp;<em>Sanitarium</em>&nbsp;and paying obvious homage to&nbsp;<em>Alien</em>,&nbsp;<em>Event Horizon</em>,&nbsp;<em>I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream,&nbsp;</em>and other bits of beloved genre fiction,&nbsp;<em>Stasis</em>&nbsp;is easily one of the best horror games in recent years&mdash;not necessarily because of overt scares, but because it tells a compelling story and has a way of getting under your skin.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="dead space" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/10/dead-space-100739505-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p>If&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>&nbsp;is the best space-based survival horror game of all time&mdash;and it is&mdash;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/17470/Dead_Space/&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html"><em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em></a>is a close second. Engineer Isaac Clarke attempts to repair an enormous space station, only to find it&rsquo;s infested by aliens known as the Necromorphs.</p>



<p><em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>is essentially the horror game&nbsp;<em>Doom 3</em>&nbsp;so desperately tried to be. It&rsquo;s absolutely worth checking out.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="anchorhead" src="https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2014/10/anchorhead-100526668-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p>Scared by&hellip; a text adventure? It&rsquo;s true. The tale of a creepy old mansion and a young couple,&nbsp;<em>Anchorhead</em>&nbsp;is over fifteen years old at this point and owes a&nbsp;<em>hefty</em>&nbsp;amount to Mr. H.P. Lovecraft. Like a good horror novel,&nbsp;<em>Anchorhead&nbsp;</em>is less about jump-out-of-your-seat scares and more about creating tension, but it does that&nbsp;<em>masterfully</em>.</p>



<p>Plus it&rsquo;s free, like most modern text adventures, and&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://iplayif.com/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2Fanchor.z8&amp;xcust=2-1-436006-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/436006/15-terrifying-pc-horror-games-to-play-with-the-lights-off.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">playable through your browser</a>.</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Overclocking isn&rsquo;t a new idea, and it isn&rsquo;t limited to high-end processors, either. In high school I overclocked the Intel Xscale CPU in my Palm Tungsten T3 from 400Hz to 600Hz, just so I could play my Quicktime copy of the trailer for The Matrix Revolutions more smoothly. (In hindsight, it wasn&rsquo;t worth it.) But the point is, you can overclock almost any computer processor, as one enterprising modder did to the little-SoC-that-could, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/420028/10-practical-raspberry-pi-projects-anybody-can-do.html">$35 Raspberry Pi</a>. </p>

After that he installed a relatively huge custom heat sink, and applied compressed air while the Pi was operating. To hit the custom 2.5GHz configuration with extra voltage, he had to constantly apply canned air to keep the whole thing at 6 degrees Celsius (43 Fahrenheit). </p>

<p>The stats: Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce RTX 3060 carries an MSRP of $329, while the Arc A770 LE costs $349 at retail. (You can grab the 8GB version for $20 less, or the Arc A750 for $289 as well.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can you really find these GPUs at these prices? Not really, not even with the current soft market for graphics cards. The RTX 3060 can be found easily from many retailers in stock, but you&rsquo;ll still be likely paying slightly more than the $329 MSRP retail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Intel Arc A770 LE, or &ldquo;Limited Edition,&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t really supposed to be limited&mdash;it&rsquo;s just a brand name, like Nvidia&rsquo;s rival &ldquo;Founders Edition&rdquo; GPUs&mdash;but it seems like it. Intel&rsquo;s graphics card is very difficult to find, having sold out quickly upon its release. We&rsquo;d guess that&rsquo;s because of more limited stock numbers rather than loads of buyers picking them up, however.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My local Microcenter seemed to get roughly four or five units each of the A750 and A770, and that&rsquo;s where I snapped up this Arc A770 16GB LE version for MSRP. Looking around as of today, they&rsquo;ve fairly difficult to find in stock and seem to already have higher pricing on the secondhand marketplaces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The win most definitely goes to the RTX 3060 for price and availability this round, as they&rsquo;re readily available.</p>

<h2 id="nvidia-rtx-3060-vs-intel-arc-a770-le-performance">Nvidia RTX 3060 vs Intel Arc A770 LE: Performance</h2>



<p>This is what everyone has been waiting for &ndash; what can Intel do against the established competition? Sometimes, it&rsquo;s fantastic, punching well above its weight. Other times, it is endlessly frustrating, with performance issues and instability causing major woes. The Arc A770 delivers very competitive results in many newer DirectX 12 and Vulkan games. On the flip side, if you want to play DX11 games&mdash;which most legacy games and non-triple-A games use&mdash;it&rsquo;s better to skip Arc, for now. </p>



<p>Keep in mind you&rsquo;ll need a newer system that supports <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394720/faster-gaming-frame-rates-for-free-resizable-bar-explained.html">PCIe Resizable BAR or Smart Access Memory</a> to take full advantage of the Intel Arc performance, which may limit some gamers with older hardware. If you haven&rsquo;t upgraded your CPU and motherboard in the last few years, the GeForce RTX 3060 is the preferable upgrade. Our full <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341464/intel-arc-a770-a750-graphics-card-xe-hpg-review.html">Arc A770 review</a> wades into the topsy-turvy performance results, but we&rsquo;ve plucked out a few benchmarks to illustrate head-to-head performance between these two cards. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Intel Arc A770" class="wp-image-1361833" height="989" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cyberpunk-2077-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Here&rsquo;s the game everyone loves to talk about &ndash; <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. With ReBar on, you&rsquo;ll have the A770 match the RTX 3060 in 1440p, but fall behind in 1080p. Clearly, Intel Arc seems to scale much better with higher resolution, so 1080p gamers will likely find the RTX 3060 a better performer.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Intel Arc A770" class="wp-image-1361835" height="987" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/watch-dogs-legion-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Let&rsquo;s look at <em>Watch Dogs Legion</em>. Here, the A770 pulls an impressive lead over the RTX 3060, even at 1080p. Keep in mind &ldquo;ReBar on&rdquo; is crucial to squeeze performance from Intel&rsquo;s GPU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Arc performs well, it certainly does so convincingly, especially if its with DX12 games. How about ray tracing performance? This has been a strong suit of Nvidia, and typically a challenge for AMD GPUs.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Intel Arc A770" class="wp-image-1361836" height="987" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RT-SOTR-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Ray tracing performance is impressive on the Arc when everything works in a stable fashion. They&rsquo;ve been able to match or beat the RTX 3060 in many cases, such as in this <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nvidia has a trick up its sleeve, however, in the form of their DLSS upscaling technology. This allows many games to run ray tracing at a much lower performance penalty while keeping higher frames rates. High fidelity visuals stay in check, too. Intel offers a similar option in the way of XeSS &ndash; but with much more limited game support at present.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Who wins the performance crown here? While Intel does pull an admittedly surprising lead in many titles when it does do well, even with ray tracing, the overall winner remains the RTX 3060 for one main reason: Consistency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unless you plan to play a very specific game where Arc excels, you&rsquo;ll be better served by the mature drivers that accompany Nvidia&rsquo;s GPUs for now, such as the RTX 3060. You will have a more consistent experience across games using DX11 and DX12. When we consider new technologies thrown in such as DLSS and ray tracing, Nvidia also has a more mature setup.</p>



<p>When Intel matures its drivers for Arc with stability improvements, the hardware can certainly prove very capable. &nbsp;</p>



<p>How about for content creators? GPU streaming has been an important performance facet to consider lately, and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/827992/tested-intel-arc-av1-video-encoder-vs-nvidia-amd.html">Arc provides impressive AV1 encoders</a>. Nvidia&rsquo;s much more expensive <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">RTX 40-series GPUs</a> do so as well, but current-gen cards like the RTX 3060 lack those capabilities. For now, Arc is one of the best options for encoding. Some content creators, such as Linus Tech Tips, have even suggested to some it may be a good idea to run a second GPU in the form of an Intel Arc purely for this capability. While I don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s a viable option for many, the increased encoding performance is certainly a point to keep an eye on for content creators.</p>



<h2><strong>Nvidia RTX 3060 vs Intel Arc A770 LE: Power and other things to know</strong></h2>



<p>The GeForce RTX 3060 is rated to pull 170 watts, which is meager compared to the numbers that most GPUs are putting out now. The Intel Arc A770 pulls a heftier 225 watts due to its larger GPU die, but that&rsquo;s still reasonable to cool. Both are typically compact enough to fit in most cases, so this should not be an issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The RTX 3060 will have much better compatibility with the older hardware that a gamer may use to accompany such a GPU. With Intel&rsquo;s Arc, you need ReBar or Smart Access Memory, which is only available on newer platforms. You&rsquo;ll need this for a good experience, or Arc performance will suffer considerably.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Intel Arc A770" class="wp-image-1361839" height="1063" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-19-at-6.36.32-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<h2><strong>Verdict: Should you consider Intel&rsquo;s Arc, or stick with the Nvidia option?</strong></h2>



<p>It may be late, but Intel finally has entered as a competitor in the GPU space. Unfortunately, it comes with several serious issues that make it tough to recommend at this point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, let&rsquo;s point to the positives. The Arc A770 pulls off some stunning surprise victories over Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 3060 (and even higher GeForce models) sometimes, in newer DX12 and Vulkan games. Even with ray-traced games, it impresses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secondly, Arc does try to do all the right extra things you want from a modern GPU &ndash; XESS upscaling, ray tracing, content creator perks, etc. It&rsquo;s also nicely designed, in a package that shows care and GPU design with some attention to detail and build quality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s the bad news: Even if you wanted one, you&rsquo;re going to have a tough time finding one for sale. It seems to have been quickly bought up by enthusiasts looking to tinker with it, and not gamers building their gaming PCs. Even with tough GPU markets, it seems to be a very limited release thus far.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Nvidia 3060" class="wp-image-1361829" height="851" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-24-at-2.44.47-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The winner: Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce RTX 3060.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Sure, we&rsquo;ve heard this story the last two years, but this time it&rsquo;s different. The retail shelves are fully loaded with Nvidia GPUs such as the RTX 3060 close to MSRP. Some very worth competitors such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394984/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review-asus-rog-strix.html">AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT</a> are also knockin&rsquo; on the door with newly reduced prices. These are readily available, and in most cases, offer more consistent performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Availability aside, driver woes are still a major issue for these debut Arc graphics cards. Will first-gen Arc age like &ldquo;Fine Wine,&rdquo; as often was said of AMD drivers? It&rsquo;s too early to tell, but as of right now, gamers will undoubtedly face more stability issues across the gaming spectrum compared to more mature drivers from Nvidia. Problems range from stuttering issues, to crashes, and flat out not working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an enthusiast, I picked an Arc A770 up purely to tinker with it, and test it out. It&rsquo;s not something that could be recommended to someone who just wants a GPU to game without issues. There are little sprinkles of potential here, however&mdash;and if Intel stays on the path of creating a great gaming GPU, one day it could very well give us the entire package. For now, you&rsquo;re better off picking up a tried-and-true GeForce RTX 3060.</p>

## Nvidia launches the 8GB GeForce RTX 3060 it should have made all along

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>When PCWorld executive editor Brad Chacos reviewed the GeForce RTX 3060 early last year, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394228/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">he said it was &ldquo;fine.&rdquo;</a> Not exactly a ringing endorsement &mdash; he felt that using 12GB of GDDR6 memory on a GPU obviously targeting 1080p gaming was overkill, and a detrimental expense at a time when graphics cards were impossible to find for a reasonable price. Today Nvidia has revealed a more economical 8GB variant of the RTX 3060, which is probably the card it should have released over a year and a half ago. </p>



<p>The 8GB variant of the card gets an unceremonious introduction: just <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3060-3060ti/&amp;xcust=2-1-1365181-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a new line on the RTX 3060 Family page on Nvidia&rsquo;s website</a>, with no press release or blog post to go with it. You can expect manufacturer variants of the cheaper card to start showing up at retailers starting in November, though given the hard-to-predict pricing of GPUs lately, it&rsquo;s anybody&rsquo;s guess what they&rsquo;ll cost. The retail price of the original 12GB version of the RTX 3060 was set at $329, at a time when actually finding it at that price would have been a miracle. Today the street price of the 12GB card is in the $370 to $410 range. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Nvidia RTX 3060 specs page with 8GB and GDDR6X highlighted" class="wp-image-1365253" height="541" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/nvidia-specs-page.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="739" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nvidia</p></div>



<p>Nvidia announced <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/544311/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-vs-rtx-3060-ti-which-gpu-should-you-buy.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">another variant of the RTX 3060 Ti</a> in the same way. It uses the same 8GB of memory it had at launch, but it&rsquo;s been upgraded from GDDR6 to GDDR6X modules. That slight bump in memory speed will boost game performance, though it&rsquo;ll probably be a negligible increase unless you&rsquo;re running with ray tracing or other high-end visual effects at high resolutions. </p>



<p>Refreshing the RTX 3060 series, especially with an ostensibly cheaper option, makes sense for Nvidia. For the first time it&rsquo;s positioning its new generation, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">the RTX 40-series</a>, as cards that will be <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1074935/nvidias-tone-deaf-pricing-is-a-golden-opportunity-for-amd-and-intel.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">sold and marketed concurrently with the older 30-series designs</a>. Of course it was always going to be a wait of several months at least for cheaper xx60 variants, but this gives Nvidia a &ldquo;new&rdquo; card to put on the shelves in the meantime. And possibly even a little breathing room to release those newer, cheaper cards, while shoppers cast weary glances across the aisle at less expensive options <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1070995/amd-sets-its-next-gen-radeon-reveal-for-november.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">from AMD</a> <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341464/intel-arc-a770-a750-graphics-card-xe-hpg-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">and Intel</a>. </p>

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>It&rsquo;s possible to love a video game. To be devoted to it, to value what it does for you and how it makes you feel, and to want the best for it. Not in the same way you love a person &mdash; or at least, I hope not. But take a look at any major fan convention for video games, movies, TV, or almost anything that develops a subculture, and you can see this love is real, active, and powerful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And of course, profitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if it&rsquo;s possible to love a video game, then of course it&rsquo;s possible to fall out of love. To feel disconnected from what first drew you to it. To realize that it isn&rsquo;t giving you everything it once did, and you can&rsquo;t give it what it needs from you. Especially if what it needs is regular digital purchases in order to get a competitive advantage in gameplay. </p>



<p>I loved <em>Overwatch </em>once. I don&rsquo;t anymore. How that happened is, I think, worth examining. This Dear John letter is a broad history of the game itself, and its relationship with both its own players and the company that made it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="the-honeymoon-phase">The honeymoon phase&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In 2016, <em>Overwatch </em>was a big deal. A <em>Team Fortress 2</em>-style team shooter, made by the people who brought us <em>Starcraft </em>and <em>Diablo</em>, with incredible character designs that looked like Pixar had decided to reboot <em>G.I. Joe</em>? <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436265/blizzard-announces-a-brand-new-shooter-overwatch-and-shows-off-starcraft-expansion-at-blizzcon.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Players couldn&rsquo;t get enough of it</a>. And indeed, for the first couple of years <em>Overwatch </em>was a 600-pound Winston of the gaming landscape, dominating game coverage, showing up constantly on Let&rsquo;s Plays, and causing an excited titter with each newly-announced character and map.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fast forward six years, and the launch of <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Overwatch 2</a></em> seems to have come and gone with barely a ripple. Between a contentious shift to free-to-play, serious launch problems, and a cloud of problematic exhaustion hovering over Activision Blizzard itself, the shine has come off of the orange stretchy yoga pants.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Custom Overwatch keycaps" class="wp-image-1359599" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DSC09561.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>In 2017 I made this custom Overwatch keycap set, using WASDKeyboards&rsquo; art tool, Adobe Illustrator, and a blatant disregard for intellectual property.&nbsp;</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>Despite being obsessed with the original game for years, slurping up every bit of lore, buying every licensed LEGO set, attending a live Overwatch League esports event, and even designing my own Overwatch keyboard, I haven&rsquo;t been able to bring myself to even enter a single game of<em> Overwatch 2</em>. I can&rsquo;t force myself to care about it, even for free. There are just too many issues, both internal and external, that make my brain actively reject the new title. I can&rsquo;t help but stare at the little brick D.Va mech on my desk, and think about all the things that have gone wrong.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="a-roster-full-of-missed-opportunities">A roster full of missed opportunities&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Without a doubt, <em>Overwatch&rsquo;s </em>greatest strength has always been its character design. Each fighter is vibrant, distinct, and interesting. You just want to inspect every little detail, like the best action figures. (In fact, these characters do make pretty great action figures.) And despite being as widely varied as a cyborg ninja, a ballerina sniper, a robot centaur, and a hamster in a 6-foot mecha ball, the art design is so skillfully executed that all of them feel part of the same day-after-tomorrow cartoon future.&nbsp;And it certainly doesn&rsquo;t hurt that there&rsquo;s a bit of PG-13 sexiness to almost all of them, even the grizzled old veterans. Blizzard knows how the bread gets buttered. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Overwatch full roster" class="wp-image-1359598" height="289" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/overwatch-roster.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Blizzard</p></div>



<p>But the designs themselves are only part of the appeal. With absolutely incredible animation (again, shades of Pixar) and skillful voice acting, the characters seem like they could walk out of a 6-on-6 deathmatch and into an anime. They kind of do: while prerendered cinematics don&rsquo;t get the same gee-wow reactions they did back in the days of the original <em>Warcraft </em>and <em>Starcraft</em>, the short vignettes created to flesh out the characters and the world of <em>Overwatch </em>remain some of the best parts of the property.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And herein lies the problem. <em>Overwatch </em>has this wonderful cast of characters, brought to life with loving animation and voice acting, and you even get to inhabit them in gameplay. But when you try to dig deeper into the story surrounding the characters, you find yourself shoveling water out of a shallow puddle. Despite most of these characters having a deep backstory with the vaguely <em>Avengers</em>-esque <em>Overwatch </em>organization, the game&rsquo;s story starts &mdash; and effectively ends &mdash; with Winston &ldquo;reactivating&rdquo; the team after years of downtime in the original intro video.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What happens next? Ostensibly, the gameplay of <em>Overwatch 1</em>&hellip;which never actually progresses the story. It&rsquo;s so vague and ill-defined that you can play on a team filled with Overwatch &ldquo;good guys,&rdquo; Talon &ldquo;bad guys,&rdquo; and the various in-between mercenary types, and it makes sense. Because there&rsquo;s no sense at all. You don&rsquo;t necessarily need it for a session of team shooting, but for those of us who&rsquo;ve been craving actual progression and depth for these characters, it feels like we&rsquo;re all Tantalus trying to get a sip.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every gorgeous cinematic is essentially prologue, much of which we already knew. Even the few seasonal event missions, repeated every year since launch ad nauseam, have to take place before the &ldquo;reactivation&rdquo; start of the story, because otherwise they don&rsquo;t make sense with the paper-thin narrative of the gameplay. Every one of the dozens of comics and short stories Blizzard has given us is adding to a huge mountain of prelude, every new character has to have something they were doing before Winston presses that pivotal &mdash; and ultimately meaningless &mdash; button.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure><p><em>Overwatch </em>was sold as an ever-expanding roster of fantastic characters. And it is, or at least it was, until work unceremoniously paused for the developers to create a pseudo-sequel. But even fighting games and MOBAs, whose characters barely ever go deeper than &ldquo;person who fights other people,&rdquo; have stories that progress and resolve to a certain degree. <em>Overwatch </em>doesn&rsquo;t, and never has. As a fan who genuinely loves a lot of these characters, watching them remain frozen in time even as the game ostensibly progresses is something I find incredibly frustrating.</p>



<h2 id="gameplay-is-a-moving-target">Gameplay is a moving target&nbsp;</h2>



<p><em>Overwatch</em>&rsquo;s gameplay struggled with a bit of an identity crisis at launch. Broadly similar to <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, it encouraged fast-paced coordination with a team, with a secondary feature of constantly switching between its many heroes to counter the choices of the other side. But while <em>TF2</em> could have huge teams and dozens of active players in its broad offense, defense, and support roles, the more varied, specialized cast in <em>Overwatch </em>had shades of MOBAs like <em>League of Legends</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the multiplayer matches never ceased to be fun, issues cropped up almost immediately. The combo of shields and turrets proved to be extremely difficult to crack without precision teamwork, especially when combined with the self-propelling cart objective. Some characters like Hanzo and Symmetra had abilities that were overpowered, making them nearly unstoppable in specific situations, while traditional shooter roles like Widowmaker&rsquo;s sniper or Tracer&rsquo;s scout were all but useless without a high-skill player behind them.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Overwatch hamster wrecking ball" class="wp-image-1359622" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/wrecking-ball-screenshot-003.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Blizzard</p></div>



<p>And of course, you had the usual problem of people missing the point of a team-based shooter: the team is more important than the shooting. Even in competitive modes, players would flock to the more viscerally fun offensive-based characters, collecting kills while tanks and supports collected dust. Again, the minute-to-minute gameplay was always fast and enjoyable, but anyone focused on actually winning games (and at least willing to try the role-based teamwork) quickly grew frustrated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blizzard&rsquo;s answer was to continually tweak both the characters and the game&rsquo;s very structure. In addition to the usual small adjustments for the sake of balance and flow, characters would receive effective redesigns from the ground up to try and address overwhelming advantages. Notable examples include axing Mercy&rsquo;s full-team revival power, tweaking turret specialists Torbjorn and Bastion to force them into more mobile roles, toning down overpowered abilities from Hanzo and Roadhog, and completely redesigning Symmetra&rsquo;s specialized power set not once, but twice.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Symmetra Overwatch 2 " class="wp-image-1359596" height="673" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/symmetra-overwatch-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Blizzard completely redesigned the skills of heroes like Symmetra, often multiple times.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Blizzard</p></div>



<p>On top of the constant character tweaks that players had to adjust to, Blizzard would radically change the game&rsquo;s setup on more than one occasion. While initially players could load up multiple copies of each character on both teams, the game switched to selections that <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://dotesports.com/general/news/kaplan-overwatch-hero-limit-season-2-3703&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blocked out a character after another player had chosen them</a>. This spelled the end of fun if tactically unsound compositions, like a team full of giant hammer-swinging Reinhardt knights and one zippy little Lucio to boost their speed and heal them up. </p>



<p>But a bigger change was re-arranging the division of characters from offense/defense/tank/support to just three divisions, damage/tank/healer. Because there was a roughly even split before, and because some characters were pretty borderline anyway, this suddenly meant that there were more than double the number of damage characters as either tank or healer&hellip;despite an ostensibly &ldquo;even&rdquo; split in the importance of those three roles.&nbsp;Initially the only real difference was fodder for team comp squabbles (&ldquo;can we PLEASE get some healers?&rdquo; asks the guy who refuses to switch off Genji), technical discussions about the meta, and lots and lots of forum battles. But as newer characters were introduced and the roster of damage choices continued to outpace tanks and supports, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://kotaku.com/overwatchs-latest-update-redeems-the-games-competitive-1837276905&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Blizzard created Role Queue</a>. This would turn out to be the least popular and most problematic choice in the game&rsquo;s brief history.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Overwatch Role Queue" class="wp-image-1359597" height="663" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Q8Z1QOXZG8QP1563419447038.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Blizzard</p></div>



<p>Forcing teams to have only one &ldquo;copy&rdquo; of each hero restricted player choices somewhat, but the large roster made up for it. But role queue forced players to choose damage, tank, or healer right from the start of their play session, with no way to switch out of that choice without ending (or just quitting) the current match. Predictably, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/elhnqg/role_queue_killed_overwatch/&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ever-longer digital lines</a> formed up behind the &ldquo;damage&rdquo; queue, which contained the most fun and popular characters even before two categories were smooshed into one gigantic one. With a big, frustrating barrier between players and the main content of the game, <em>Overwatch </em>suddenly became an exercise in patience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While all of this was going on, Blizzard seemed more concerned with a part of the game that, well, wasn&rsquo;t actually a part of the game. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://gamerant.com/nfl-owners-sponsoring-overwatch-league/&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Overwatch League</a> was meant to be a bold new direction in esports, adapting city-based teams and fandoms into a system that had previously been more akin to following individual golfers or boxers climb up the ranks. Initially met with a lot of optimism among <em>Overwatch </em>fans, if not esports as a whole, Blizzard sank billions into establishing the league and getting investors for the dozens of city-based teams.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Overwatch League stage" class="wp-image-1359592" height="599" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/overwatch-league.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="996" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Activision Blizzard</p></div>



<p>But as it turns out, you can&rsquo;t make a game that appeals equally to the kind of .01 percent of gamers who can compete internationally, and the kind of gamers who can enjoy <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://nintendeal.com/review/overwatch-legendary-edition-review-30-fps-and-i-just-dont-care/&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">playing a fast-paced shooter on the Nintendo Switch</a>. Blizzard&rsquo;s gameplay tweaks and balance adjustments quickly seemed to pivot towards making OWL matches closer and more exciting, instead of trying to keep the various playable heroes on even footing for the casual and competitive modes of <em>Overwatch </em>itself. (You know, the thing millions of players were actively engaging in the product, instead of watching it on a Twitch stream.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between long wait times to play in role queue, tweaks that seemed to be made for the benefit of everyone except the game&rsquo;s player base, and content updates that became more and more anemic, <em>Overwatch </em>gradually lost grip of the public&rsquo;s attention and never got it back. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398308/blizzcon-2019-blizzard-announces-diablo-iv-overwatch-2-world-of-warcraft-shadowlands.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">announcement of <em>Overwatch 2</em></a>, and the subsequent and indefinite wait for it to actually release, essentially spelled the end of the original game.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="broken-pve-promises">Broken PvE promises</h2>



<p>Which isn&rsquo;t to say that it was the death of <em>Overwatch </em>as a brand. Blizzard did a poor job of explaining exactly what <em>Overwatch 2</em> is, aside from the fact that it isn&rsquo;t a sequel in the conventional sense. But one of the most exciting features was to be an expanded focus on player-versus-environment modes, indulging players like me who wanted more story and weren&rsquo;t necessarily invested in the constant competition of the opposing shooter modes.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Overwatch 2 PvE skill tree" class="wp-image-1359594" height="601" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/overwatch-pve.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The skill tree from Overwatch 2&rsquo;s PvE mode&hellip;which you won&rsquo;t see until 2023. At least.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Blizzard</p></div>



<p>After a few years of short and repetitive PvE missions, which as I previously said were wholly uninterested in actually progressing the story or the characters beyond the big button press, I was stoked. The initial Blizzcon 2019 presentation seemed to indicate that we&rsquo;d be getting a series of grander and much more interesting single-player missions, focusing on dynamic team compositions, set-piece battles, and upgrading and expanding individual powers as they progressed, MOBA-style.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This would be a huge improvement on the first game, which offered a grand total of four missions in which you could team up to tell an actual story. (One of which, Junkenstein&rsquo;s Revenge, was an entertaining but non-canon dress-up session.) The first cinematic for <em>Overwatch 2 </em>even drove this point home: the team is finally assembled and ready for action, ostensibly getting off the giant pause button the story had been suck on since 2016.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure><p>And yet, when Blizzard announced it was finally ready for beta testers, what it would be testing was&hellip;the standard multiplayer mode. Sure, there are tweaks: another character power reboot for Orisa, newcomer Sojourn (another offense hero, natch), and teams are now limited to five players on a side instead of six. But that highly-touted PvE content, as it turns out, will have to wait until 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let that sink in for a moment. This game, which started with what looked like an interesting setup to tell stories in a brand new Blizzard world, has to wait <em>seven years</em> after its initial launch date to get any kind of forward progression for those stories. And that&rsquo;s assuming that Blizzard actually fulfills its promise and doesn&rsquo;t give us a series of insubstantial mini-missions, as was the case with the original game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I played through the beta, and made a few observations with friends about how it had shifted slightly. Quicker gameplay, less focus on shields with only one tank per side, an easier time breaking through choke points. But it felt like a refinement of the original game, not a true sequel or even a re-launch. Any enthusiasm I had for engaging in this universe in which I had invested so much time was, once again, put on pause.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="and-everything-else">&hellip;and everything else&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The final death knell for my interest in <em>Overwatch 2 </em>came when it was announced that it would switch to a free-to-play setup with a battle pass system, in which players would need to either pay or grind to unlock new characters. (Those who hadn&rsquo;t bought the first game, which would disappear once <em>Overwatch 2 </em>launched, would even have to grind to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/09/28/overwatch-2-it-will-take-new-players-about-100-matches-to-unlock-all-original-heroes&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unlock some of the <em>original cast</em></a>.) With every game from <em>Fortnite </em>to <em>Rocket League</em> to <em>Clash of Clans</em> trying to sell me a battle pass, and then trying to get me to grind it out multiple times every year, I&rsquo;d had enough.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Overwatch 2 battle pass" class="wp-image-1359595" height="517" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/overwatch-2-battle-pass.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>To play devil&rsquo;s advocate, <em>Overwatch </em>really should have been a free-to-play game from the start. Activision Blizzard has <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/revenue&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">made more money slinging the randomized loot boxes</a>, primed with limited events and artificial scarcity to such a degree that they&rsquo;ve been <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/loot-box-laws-block-diablo-immortal-launch-in-some-european-countries/&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">banned as de facto gambling in some countries</a>, than it ever did in sales of the actual game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But battle passes have quickly become an even more greedy alternative, particularly where Activision Blizzard is concerned. True, they don&rsquo;t require spinning a roulette wheel to unlock their ingrained prizes. But they&rsquo;ve now become a way of splitting the player base into the haves and have-nots, in which those who pay up have specific advantages in gameplay. That&rsquo;s not always the case &mdash; <em>Fortnite</em> remains refreshingly dedicated to cosmetic-only upgrades, for example.&nbsp;But it&rsquo;s certainly true in <em>Overwatch</em>, where half of the strategy is supposed to be switching your character on the fly to counter the choices of the other team and complement your own. And Activision Blizzard had recently <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/hearthstone-is-introducing-premium-currency-and-a-battlegrounds-season-pass-players-are-unimpressed/&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pulled the same distasteful move in <em>Hearthstone</em></a>, where players of the popular Battlegrounds mode now have to pay real money to get the best chance of pulling the hero they actually want to use.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Hearthstone battlepass" class="wp-image-1359619" height="889" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hearthstone-Screenshot-10-23-22-16.47.31.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Overwatch isn&rsquo;t the only Blizzard game trying to suck more money out of you: Hearthstone now charges for hero choices in Battlegrounds.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Blizzard</p></div>



<p>After years of grinding for lootboxes and somehow still missing out on some of the best skins in the game, <em>Overwatch </em>players are no strangers to dealing with Activision Blizzard&rsquo;s greed. The manipulative battle pass system was the straw that broke the hover-payload for me. I had been growing increasingly frustrated with the company due to its behind-the-scenes problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you follow game industry news, you know what I&rsquo;m talking about. An apparent willingness to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitzchung_controversy#:~:text=Banning%20of%20Ng%20Wai%20Chung,-On%20October%206&amp;text=The%20company%20cited%20a%20rule,still%20bound%20by%20competition%20rules.&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">engage in China&rsquo;s oppressive cultural mandates</a>.

Without turning this article into a laundry list of complaints against Activision Blizzard, it seems to be a deeply troubled company that doesn&rsquo;t treat its employees with even basic dignity. Its responses to these controversies have been the usual corporate dross, and have done almost nothing to indicate that it&rsquo;s interested in actual change.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/605846/microsoft-hopes-to-buy-activision-blizzard-in-a-deal-that-would-make-gaming-history.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard at the start of this year,</a> part of its ongoing efforts to create a stable of first-party developers and publishers to compete with Sony and Nintendo.

It doesn&rsquo;t seem like Microsoft cares whether Activision Blizzard continues to slide towards anti-consumer monetization strategies, either.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="no-big-loss">No big loss&nbsp;</h2>



<p>So with all of that running through my mind, I felt weirdly relieved trying to get into a game of <em>Overwatch 2 </em>on launch day, and being met with a queue of 40,000 people that never seemed to get any shorter. The situation stayed the same for three days, and each time the game stubbornly refused to load, I almost felt happy to go do something else.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzard-and-overwatch-2-struck-by-third-ddos-attack-in-a-week&amp;xcust=2-1-1359589-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Blizzard said it was a DDOS attack.</a> I say it was a blessing, an excuse to close the launcher and find another game to fill my time. It&rsquo;s possible to actually get into matches now, despite an ongoing host of issues &mdash; perhaps not surprising from a company that seems to be actively battling its own QA department. But my experience with<em> Overwatch 2</em> is still limited to about an hour of the beta.&nbsp;                                      </p>

<p><em>Overwatch </em>isn&rsquo;t the same game it was in 2016. That&rsquo;s no indictment: a multiplayer game actively courting an audience of millions should change, especially if it sells itself on remaining new and interesting. But for every improvement the <em>Overwatch </em>developers have made, it seems like they&rsquo;ve also taken a step back, especially in terms of avaricious monetization. And Blizzard certainly isn&rsquo;t the same developer it was in 2016&hellip;or at least, it isn&rsquo;t the developer we <em>thought </em>it was, unburdened by a host of illuminating peeks behind the curtain. </p>



<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll re-engage with this once-wonderful property when it launches some story content next year, and becomes more than &ldquo;<em>Overwatch 1.5</em>.&rdquo; Maybe some time apart will be good for both of us. Or maybe I&rsquo;ll skim the gaming news headlines and see if Activision Blizzard has decided to treat its employees better, perhaps under the stern gaze of its new owner and the guiding hand of absolutely anyone except Bobby Kotick.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Or maybe I&rsquo;ll forget all about it between now and then. Maybe most of <em>Overwatch</em>&rsquo;s original fans will, too. I shouldn&rsquo;t be tempted to return to a place that I know is bad for me, just because I can remember when it wasn&rsquo;t. Maybe I&rsquo;ll let this overly long article serve as the final breakup for a game I used to genuinely love. At this point I&rsquo;m reminded of perhaps the most famous breakup line in history: Frankly, <em>Overwatch</em>, I don&rsquo;t give a damn.&nbsp;</p>

Its use of post-consumer recycled plastics helps it stand out in a competitive field of 2022 laptops.</p>
</div>


<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard the slogan: recycle, reuse, reduce. While you likely know what that might mean for everyday items like cans, how would it apply to a laptop PC? That&rsquo;s something Acer&rsquo;s exploring with its Aspire Vero line of computers.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Acer Aspire Vero 14 is a laptop that&rsquo;s made from a number of materials, many of them recycled, most importantly, post-consumer recycled. From the unboxing experience to the laptop itself, this is a machine made with the environment in mind. But what will you sacrifice for the bragging rights of toting around a laptop made from trash? Let&rsquo;s find out.<br />&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="acer-aspire-vero-specifications-and-features">Acer Aspire Vero specifications and features</h2>



<p>Our review unit is packing an Intel Core i7-1225U, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of NVMe PCIe SSD storage. For more details, check out the bulleted list below:</p>

<p>The Acer Aspire Vero has a design that&rsquo;s unlike most other laptops. Embracing its plastic-ness, the Vero is completely covered in textured plastic with yellow and grey flecks embedded. The plastic is lightly textured with a slight raised dot pattern. Acer says that these components are made from 30% post-consumer recycled materials. The yellow in the grey chassis is echoed in a few distinctive touches, from the yellow rubber feet on the bottom of the laptop to the yellow coloration on the flipped R and E keys, symbolizing the importance of that old chestnut &ldquo;reduce, reuse, recycle.&rdquo;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Logo" class="wp-image-1363010" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/acer-aspire-vero-acer-logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>In lieu of stickers, the Aspire Vero mostly embosses its intentions into the plastic, from the Acer logos to the Intel Evo stamp of approval to the Post-Consumer Recycled logo. No paint is used on the Aspire Vero, eliminating a source of volatile organic compounds from the manufacturing process.<br />&nbsp;<br />On the whole, even if I didn&rsquo;t know that this was made from recycled plastic, the Aspire Vero is attractive, full stop. Admittedly, this isn&rsquo;t the thinnest, sleekest, or lightest laptop around but its extra heft helps it stand out. Many plastic laptops feel cheap, but the Aspire Vero bucks the trend by using the material in a way that is more sustainable, feels nice, and looks good to boot.</p>



<h2 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Aspire Vero left ports" class="wp-image-1363012" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/acer-aspire-vero-left-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>If you&rsquo;re in need of ports, the Aspire Vero doesn&rsquo;t skimp. At this price, we hoped to find a Thunderbolt 4 and we found that and more. On this 14-inch version, there are 2 USB-A ports, both with USB 3 speeds, a headset jack, and a full-sized HDMI port. If you have a compatible charger, there&rsquo;s a vestigial DC-in barrel plug as well, although the version of the Vero we sampled came with a 65-watt USB-C PD charger in the box.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you&rsquo;re looking for the latest and greatest in wireless, the Aspire Vero packs the newer, faster Wi-Fi 6E along with Bluetooth 5.2. Need wired connectivity? The bigger 15-inch Aspire Vero has a gigabit ethernet port as standard. Otherwise, the 14-inch can easily plug into a Thunderbolt hub with wired ethernet or a standalone USB adapter and still have ports to spare.<br />&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="keyboard-and-trackpad">Keyboard and trackpad</h2>



<p>Given the plastic nature of the Aspire Vero, you might think that the keyboard is a cheap, chintzy affair. Thankfully, you get a nice set of keys on this machine, backlit by default (with two levels of brightness) and a shallow but responsive-feeling amount of travel on each button. If you use the delete key a lot, you might need to retrain your brain to not hit the power button&ndash;it&rsquo;s right above the backspace, where delete usually is on a lot of other keyboard layouts. Following the recycled theme, the keycaps on the Aspire Vero are made with 50% post-consumer recycled plastic.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Aspire Vero touchpad" class="wp-image-1363014" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/acer-aspire-vero-fingerprint-reader-touchpad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p><br />&nbsp;<br />The touchpad, likewise, is recycled from plastic Acer calls OceanGlass. I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what this means, but it sounds that unlike the rest of the machine, this isn&rsquo;t post-consumer material. Anyways, the plastic touchpad feels almost like glass, giving a highly polished and soft surface that works great for pointing and gestures. Embedded in the touchpad is a small, rectangular fingerprint sensor, which makes secure log-ins fast and stress-free.</p>



<h2 id="display-speakers-and-webcam">Display, speakers, and webcam</h2>



<p>Even though the Aspire Vero takes liberties with its eco-inspired design and recycled materials, the display panel in this laptop is a pretty ordinary 1080P HD IPS screen. It gets plenty bright, with a peak brightness around 300 nits. The contrast looked great and colors were vibrant without looking oversaturated. For day-to-day use, I had no qualms with this display. The only thing I&rsquo;d change is the aspect ratio&ndash;its 16&times;9 widescreen shape is good for binge watching shows, but the extra vertical space of a 16&times;10 screen is my preference for productivity.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Aspire Vero webcam photo" class="wp-image-1363016" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/WIN_20221005_16_48_51_Pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p><br />&nbsp;<br />The webcam is a decent enough unit, coming in with a 1080p resolution. I looked pretty good except in a heavily backlit scene in a caf&eacute;. The noise is kept under control quite nicely and even in that backlit instance, my face never looked too smooth or blotchy. Noise canceling dual microphones helped keep some of the background noise at bay and my voice sounded clear enough even with other ambient sounds around.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Aspire Vero speaker" class="wp-image-1363019" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/acer-aspire-vero-speaker.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p><br />&nbsp;<br />In the last few years, laptop speakers have gotten impressive. That said, Acer didn&rsquo;t seem to put much effort into the Aspire Vero&rsquo;s sound system. The stereo speakers are weak and, perhaps worst of all, fire downwards from the bottom of the computer. That might not be bad if you&rsquo;re using it on a desk or kitchen countertop, but on a lap or any kind of softer surface, the speakers are muffled to be nearly indistinguishable.</p>



<h2 id="software">Software</h2>



<p>I can appreciate what Acer was going for when it included its VeroSense software with this laptop. The intention there is neat, as this app lets you track the power usage of your Aspire Vero, change the power profile, and cap the battery&rsquo;s charge at 80% if you&rsquo;re gonna use it at a desk often (this helps prolong your battery&rsquo;s health immensely). That said, Windows 11 Home includes some pretty helpful and nice visuals in its Settings app, which you can also use to gauge power usage while turning down settings to save battery life.<br />&nbsp;<br />Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s an ugly side to the software that&rsquo;s preloaded on the Aspire Vero and that&rsquo;s the presence of Norton and ExpressVPN. Both apps will bug you to sign up for their paid services, making pop-ups an annoyance when using the laptop. Dropbox even tried to give me a special deal on storage, unprompted. Sometimes, this brought some of my testing to a screeching halt.</p>



<p>I had similar issues with the cheaper Acer Aspire 5, so I&rsquo;m not surprised. Like that machine, the Aspire Vero also loads your Start menu up with random junk you&rsquo;ll probably never use, including a <em>League of Legends</em> coaching website link, <em>Forge of Empires</em>, and a dummy app that tells you that Intel&rsquo;s Unison is coming soon (how exciting!). On top of the standard Windows 11 junk, this makes the Aspire Vero feel like someone&rsquo;s logged on before you and installed a bunch of apps you didn&rsquo;t want. Not the ideal start to a life with a new laptop.</p>



<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>



<p>With its Intel Core i7-1255U, this otherwise modest Acer Aspire Vero 14 AV14-51-73LM is a bit faster than you might think. While it only has two performance cores, the power on display here is awesome for day-to-day tasks. One of the only downside to this laptop might be its soldered-on RAM, leaving no room for future memory upgrades that might help the system feel peppier in the long run.<br />&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Acer Aspire Vero PCMark10" class="wp-image-1363024" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/acer-aspire-vero-pcmark10.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>We use the PCMark 10 benchmark to get an overall picture of a laptop&rsquo;s performance. The i7-1255U might not have many of the burly performance cores that Intel blends with efficiency cores, but it still held its own with others in its class. The Acer Aspire Vero was only a bit slower than the more powerful Lenovo Yoga 9i, which sports a better Intel chip inside.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Acer Aspire Vero Cinebench" class="wp-image-1363026" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/acer-aspire-vero-cinebenchr15.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>In another performance test, we use Cinebench R15 to get a sense for how well all a laptop&rsquo;s cores work together to render a 3D model. The Acer Aspire Vero held up well against the competition, giving us the performance we&rsquo;d expect from this Intel chip with a U at the end&ndash;not too potent, but no slouch either. As it stands, Intel&rsquo;s chips are still bested by the latest AMD Ryzen mobile processors since those chips have more of the powerful type of core, as we see with the HP Pavilion Aero in this test.<br />&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Acer Aspire Vero 3DMark" class="wp-image-1363028" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/acer-aspire-vero-timespy.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>So, you like to play games, eh? Well, don&rsquo;t expect amazing results from the Acer Aspire Vero. It has an edge over many recent Intel chips in that instead of 80 execution units on the integrated Xe graphics chip, it comes with 96. We&rsquo;d say you can comfortably play e-sports titles like <em>Rocket League</em> on this laptop and especially if you like retro games or indie games, you&rsquo;ll find it plenty performant as shown in the intensive 3DMark Time Spy benchmark chart.<br />&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Acer Aspire Vero Handbrake" class="wp-image-1363029" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/acer-aspire-vero-handbrake.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>In our Handbrake rendering test, the Intel i7-1255U&rsquo;s extra Xe graphics cores come in handy, helping the Aspire Vero in transcoding a big HD video into one suitable for use on a tablet. In this test, we can see this laptop punches above its weight thanks to Intel&rsquo;s QuickSync video tech and would say it&rsquo;s performant enough for some light video editing tasks.</p>



<h2 id="battery-life">Battery life</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Acer Aspire Vero battery life" class="wp-image-1363033" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/acer-aspire-vero-batterylife.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>When looking at competing portability-focused laptops, it&rsquo;s clear that the Acer Aspire Vero&rsquo;s body chassis isn&rsquo;t just made of recycled plastic&ndash; it also has a little extra space for a bigger battery. Slimmer laptops with a taper just can&rsquo;t fit a lot of stuff inside, so Acer was able to stick in a chunky 56 watt-hour battery inside. That let the Aspire Vero sail past the 10 hour mark in our video loop test, putting it in good company with other modern laptop PCs. If you use your laptop away from your desk frequently, take a look at the Aspire Vero.<br />&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Although Acer could have coasted on the Aspire Vero&rsquo;s recycled materials and cool design, we were surprised to find that it&rsquo;s a very competent laptop. Between its decently peppy Intel chip, excellent battery life, and plentiful ports, there&rsquo;s tons to love on top of its eco-conscious design. Once you uninstall Norton and the other annoying bloatware, you&rsquo;ll have an awesome little computer.<br />&nbsp;<br />That said, the things Acer is doing with the Vero series shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily need calling out&ndash;they should be a baseline for the industry. We&rsquo;d love to see the post-consumer recycled materials and eco-friendly thinking used here across the Acer lineup and beyond. If combined with a upgradeable, super repairable approach like that of Framework, there could be a meaningful reduction of waste in laptop computers that could keep a lot of useful material from the landfill.</p>
