The first is that the people who control Joe Biden know what little self-control conservative content hustlers like myself are with embarrassing Biden videos and pump the content out there as a distraction. The second is Biden's handlers are the most incompetent people to ever work in politics and need to be blacklisted on the grounds of being too stupid to breathe.</p><p>No self-respecting political hack should EVER allow the President of the United States to be led like a child and need to be shown how to sit down.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Schumer to Biden: \"Great job!
