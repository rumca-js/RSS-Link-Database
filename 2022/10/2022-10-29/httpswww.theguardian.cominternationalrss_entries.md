<p>What Arsenal have done this season is already remarkable, even if signs of fatigue are already starting to show</p><p>Titles races often hinge on single moments – or at least our memories of them, the narratives we construct to process them, do. Stan Cullis’s non-tackle, Ray Tinkler’s idiosyncratic interpretation of offside, Steve Bruce’s header, Newcastle’s 4-3 defeat at Anfield, Sergio Agüero’s finish, Riyad Mahrez skipping by Nicolás Otamendi – far more uplifting to remember the moments of brilliance and infamy, to isolate heroes and villains, than to consider the grand sweeps of economic determinism. Gossip and goals tend to be more fun than Marxist analyses.</p><p>Manchester City will almost certainly win the Premier League and they will do so because of the collection of great players gathered under a great coach, all funded by Abu Dhabi as part of the wider geopolitical strategy of the oil-and-gas-rich Gulf states. Or, if you prefer your history more event-driven, it may be that the key moment of this campaign has already happened.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/oct/29/to-be-in-the-premier-league-race-at-all-is-a-mark-of-progress-for-this-arsenal-team">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Pulitzer-winning science author on combining the history of cell biology with personal stories, the influence of Salman Rushdie and why he likes to write in bed</p><p>Siddhartha Mukherjee is the author of four science books, including <em>The Emperor of All Maladies</em>, which won the 2011 Pulitzer prize for general nonfiction and the <em>Guardian</em> first book award. Born in Delhi in 1970 and educated at Stanford, Oxford (as a Rhodes scholar), and Harvard, Mukherjee is now assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University, as well as a cancer physician and researcher. He lives in New York City with his wife, Sarah Sze, an artist, and their two daughters. His latest book, <em>The Song of the Cell</em>, will be published on 3 November.</p><p><strong>Why a book about cells?<br /></strong>Cell biology had always been at the centre of my thinking – as an oncologist, I look at cells through cancer, which is their ultimate distortion. So much of our attention has been occupied by genetics over the past century, but a gene is lifeless without cells.

This was typical. No journalist had a deeper sense of history than Jack. He frequently recalled his childhood and his formative years, after his parents moved back to Scotland when he was seven, in North Queensferry, Fife – where he interviewed with rare insight and sensibility the then chancellor in 2003 in a piece that began: “Gordon Brown lives in the house I once delivered newspapers to.” </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/29/no-journalist-had-a-deeper-sense-of-history-than-ian-jack">Continue reading...</a>

City had a brief fright when John Stones’s headed clearance cannoned off Rúben Dias and just wide of Ederson’s goal but the visitors swept upfield on the counter from the resulting corner. De Bruyne raced down the right flank and sent a teasing ball across the six-yard box that just eluded Ilkay Gündogan.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/oct/29/leicester-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

They were already pretty loose. My father was one of those 1960s men who, in the pre-digital crossed-line age of phone boxes and busy signals and telegrams in an emergency, managed to start a second family without the first one knowing anything about it. When the truth was revealed (not to everyone – it would be another four or five years before my sister and I discovered that we had half-siblings), that wasn’t the end of the calamity. The First Family, or three-quarters of it, had to move house in the new belt-tightening regime, but there was a short period between houses, maybe a couple of months, that was partly spent in what might have been called a pensione if it had been in Italy rather than on the outskirts of Maidenhead, and partly spent in the house of a family friend who already had three children of her own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/29/marian-keyes-nick-hornby-leila-slimani-benjamin-zephaniah-elif-shafak-books-that-changed-them">Continue reading...</a>

<p><em>In this, one of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/in-the-shadow-of-putin-s-russia">series</a> of essays on the war in Ukraine from countries in or neighbouring the former Eastern bloc, a Hungarian historian asks how long the country can remain on the fence</em></p><p>The invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 will go down in the annals of European history. Russia’s undeclared war has cast an almost apocalyptic shadow. And it has dramatically altered the relationships that had prevailed between east and west since the collapse of the USSR. Whenever or however this armed conflict ends, it will undoubtedly take a long time for a new peace-guaranteeing equilibrium to be established. At the very least, the European Union and Nato now have to reckon with a hostile power on their borders and to prepare for a new phase of the cold war.</p><p>Hungarians voted in general elections just weeks after the invasion, in April, and it seems reasonable to assume that the war next door had an influence on the result. Given the climate of fear that the devastating “special military operation” created, Hungarians <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/viktor-orban-expected-to-win-big-majority-in-hungarian-general-election">voted to keep Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz</a> in power rather than risk an untested six-party coalition. This assumption also underlies Orbán’s response, which is to stay out of the conflict to the point of being “exempted”, a position that has been condemned as a betrayal by Hungary’s western allies. Hungary refuses to allow arms shipments destined for Kyiv to transit Hungarian territory and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/hungary-sanctions-russian-oil-embargo-eu">blocks the extension of EU sanctions against Russia</a> to the energy sector.

<p>The U2 frontman’s autobiography is bracingly self-aware, albeit stuffed full of famous names</p><p>When manager Paul McGuinness took on U2 in 1978 he said, quoting F Scott Fitzgerald, that their 18-year-old frontman saw “the whole equation”. Incapable of meeting punk’s standards of cool, the young Dubliners found improbable success by going too far and being too much. That impulse produced fabulous coups, from their performance at Live Aid in 1985 to their reinvention of stadium rock with Zoo TV – as well as memorable disasters, notably the decision to deposit 2014’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/11/u2-songs-of-innocence-review" title="">Songs of Innocence</a> into every iTunes account in the world. As Bono writes in this, his first memoir: “Our best work is never too far from our worst.”</p><p>The same goes for his extracurricular activities. Nobody has done more to expand the parameters of rock stardom, often in contentious ways. If any song title sums him up, then it’s Tryin’ to Throw Your Arms Around the World, from 1991’s Achtung Baby. Bono wants to go everywhere, meet everyone, learn everything and somehow pull it all together. His failures are therefore more interesting than most people’s successes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/29/surrender-40-songs-one-story-by-bono-review-a-rattling-good-yarn">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Russia’s defence minister says mobilisation of 300,000 reservists finished and ‘no further measures are planned’; Antonio Guterres calls for west to help remove blocks to Russian grain exports</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/29/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-248-of-the-invasion">What we know on day 248 of the invasion</a></li></ul><p>The UN secretary general has urged Russia and Ukraine to renew the deal that has seen more than 8m tonnes of grain exported from Ukraine and brought down global food prices.</p><p><strong>Antonio Guterres</strong> also called for other countries, mainly in the west, to expedite the removal of obstacles blocking Russian grain and fertiliser exports, Agence France-Presse reported. </p><p>Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has said the <strong>partial mobilisation of reservists announced in September <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/28/russia-says-82000-conscripts-from-emergency-draft-already-in-ukraine">“has been completed”</a> </strong>and<strong> </strong>“no further measures are planned”.<strong> </strong>Speaking at a meeting with Vladimir Putin broadcast on state television, Shoigu said 82,000 mobilised recruits were in the conflict zone and a further 218,000 in training in barracks. His statement reflects what the west called a desperate effort to halt Kyiv’s counteroffensive with poorly trained troops.</p><p><strong>About 4 million people across Ukraine are being hit by power cuts</strong> from rolling blackouts due to Russia’s bombing campaign, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Agence Frence-Presse quoted energy company DTEK, the operator for the Kyiv region, as saying it would have to introduce “unprecedented” power cuts to prevent a complete blackout.</p><p>Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he had received a phone call from his Iranian counterpart, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, on Friday and had <strong>demanded Tehran stop sending weapons to Russia</strong>. Ukraine and western allies accuse Iran of sending “kamikaze” drones to Russia that have been used to devastating effect against Ukrainian infrastructure. Iran denies the charge.</p><p><strong>At least four people were killed and 10 wounded </strong>when several towns neighbouring the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia power plant were hit by shelling, a statement from the Ukrainian presidential office said.</p><p>The Russian defence ministry said its forces had repelled attempted<strong> Ukrainian advances in the east</strong> and had destroyed a Ukrainian military factory near the town of Pavlograd.</p><p><strong>The US will provide $275m in additional military assistance</strong> to Ukraine, including arms, munitions and equipment from US defence department inventories, the secretary of state has said. “We are also working to provide Ukraine with the air defence capabilities it needs with the two initial US-provided Nasams ready for delivery to Ukraine next month,” Antony Blinken said. “And we are working with allies and partners to enable delivery of their own air defence systems to Ukraine.”</p><p><strong>Assets belonging to Russian and Belarusian individuals seized by Ukraine could be used for the huge postwar reconstruction effort</strong>, the Ukrainian finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, has been quoted as saying. The government has frozen Russian and Belarusian assets in Ukraine worth about 44 billion hryvnias ($1.21bn) since the start of Moscow’s invasion, according to the Economic Security Bureau, a state agency.</p><p><strong>The European Union has appointed a Polish general, Piotr Trytek, to lead a new training operation with Ukrainian troops.</strong> Trytek, 51, was chosen as part of the EU’s pledge to step up military support for Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Vladimir Putin’s first deputy chief of staff has visited the Russian-held Ukrainian city of Kherson.</strong> Sergei Kiriyenko stopped at a ferry port where hundreds of people were being removed by order of Russian authorities.</p><p><strong>A Russian official’s threat to strike western satellites</strong> <strong>aiding Ukraine </strong>has raised concerns among space lawyers and industry executives about the safety of objects in orbit. No country has carried out a missile strike against an enemy’s satellite.</p><p><strong>UN nuclear inspectors are expected to reach a conclusion soon on Russia’s claims of the possible production of a “dirty bomb”. </strong>Investigators are being sent to two locations in Ukraine where Russia alleged the activities were taking place.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-says-draft-completed-un-chief-appeals-for-renewed-grain-deal">Continue reading...</a>

The original, released to great fanfare in 2018, was such a hit across the board – with critics, at the box office, as a cultural force – that it seems all the sequel can do is let down, especially in this economy. Never mind that this is a major studio franchise with a keen global audience we’re talking about here. Black Panther is still a <em>Black </em>film, a label that always makes for disproportionately higher stakes.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s a Black western or a Black musical comedy like Sister Act or a Black action franchise like Creed or a comic book film like Black Panther,” says the esteemed film historian Elvis Mitchell. “They’re still first and foremost Black movies.

<p>He’s gone from largely writing under-appreciated cult classics to renowned creator of a smash-hit comedy – and he’s not sure it’s really him. Might he call time on his brilliant satire?</p><p>“Luxury problems,” says writer-director Mike White, appearing via Zoom from his house in Hawaii. He’s 10 minutes late because he totally forgot we were meeting. He’s hunting for his glasses which turn out to be on his head. This past week has been manic, what with the edit of season two of his HBO comedy The White Lotus, the premiere, the press calls and round tables. “I feel pulverised,” he declares and then promptly laughs at himself. Luxury problems, he knows, aren’t really problems at all. “Also, you don’t want to be the guy who complains because he has a hit show.”</p><p>Season one of The White Lotus made White an overnight star at the age of 52. His class-war satire <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/sep/12/emmys-2022-succession-ted-lasso-the-white-lotus-triumph">scooped 10 awards at the Emmys last month</a>. It’s his biggest (some say only) mainstream success since he wrote 2003’s School of Rock. White can’t explain it.

The government has frozen Russian and Belarusian assets in Ukraine worth about 44 billion hryvnias ($1.21bn) since the start of Moscow’s invasion, according to the Economic Security Bureau, a state agency.</p><p><strong>The European Union has appointed a Polish general, Piotr Trytek, to lead a new training operation with Ukrainian troops.</strong> Trytek, 51, was chosen as part of the EU’s pledge to step up military support for Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Vladimir Putin’s first deputy chief of staff has visited the Russian-held Ukrainian city of Kherson.</strong> Sergei Kiriyenko stopped at a ferry port where hundreds of people were being removed by order of Russian authorities.</p><p><strong>A Russian official’s threat to strike western satellites</strong> <strong>aiding Ukraine </strong>has raised concerns among space lawyers and industry executives about the safety of objects in orbit.
