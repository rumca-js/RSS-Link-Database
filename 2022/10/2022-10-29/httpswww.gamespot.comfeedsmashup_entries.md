This is partially because of her abilities, which had to be tweaked slightly to fit the needs of the mobile game. But there are other factors at play when it comes to tailoring your gameplay strategy specifically to fit Ash on a mobile device.

With hundreds of games to choose from, a fair number of entries from the horror genre were bound to creep in and lurk in the shadows of the subscription service, biding their time until they can strike your download queue.</p><p>So which horror games are the best on Game Pass? We've gone through the entire catalog, lost several expendable interns, and emerged with these terrifying tales of interactive fun that you can sink your teeth into.</p><p>Between new releases such as Scorn and A Plague Tale: Requiem and older titles like The Evil Within 2 and Inside, there are a bunch of great horror and horror-adjacent games available for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. With Halloween right around the corner, it's the perfect time to play some spine-tingling games.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/164441168908?toolid=10001&amp;mkcid=1&amp;campid=5338497749&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-53200-19255-0&amp;customid=subid_value">Get 3 months of Game Pass Ultimate for $31</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>A Plague Tale: Requiem</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4055020-aplaguetalerequiem.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>There's a lot of shockingly good horror to uncover in A Plague Tale: Requiem, but like the best slices of horror, the game is a strong reminder that people are the biggest monsters around. Even if you're not too fussed with medieval misery, Requiem's signature rat technology that can spawn thousands of the vermin in a stage is bound to leave you with a cold feeling in the pit of your stomach.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/a-plague-tale-requiem-review-picturesque-terror/1900-6417981/">A Plague Tale: Requiem review</a>.</em></p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/a-plague-tale-requiem/9nd0jvb184xl">See on Xbox Store</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Alan Wake's American Nightmare</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4055019-alanwake%27samericannightmare.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>2010's Alan Wake is a slow-burning descent into dark stories and the power of words, but its spin-off American Nightmare puts the meta-narrative on the backburner. Instead, this game is a more action-packed romp where you have to navigate a timeloop of danger in a remote location, staying on your toes for the danger that lurks around you. It'll definitely spike your adrenaline levels, and it's a perfect game for a short 'n sweet experience.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alan-wakes-american-nightmare-review/1900-6379740/">Alan Wake's American Nightmare review</a>.</em></p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/bw08nw03fx4r">See on Xbox Store</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Alien: Isolation</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4054971-alien.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>We've had plenty of Alien games over the years, but Alien: Isolation is arguably the only one that captures the unique sensation of spacebound terror born from some of the most hideous monsters to ever grace the silver screen.

Whether you're stepping into the shoes of a slasher icon or avoiding an early demise, years worth of fine-tuning and progress has made Dead by Daylight one of the best multiplayer horror games on shelves today.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-by-daylight-review/1900-6416464/">Dead by Daylight review</a>.</em></p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=[subid_value]&amp;murl=https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/dead-by-daylight/C0N22P73QZ60">See on Xbox Store</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Evil Within 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4055014-theevilwithin2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>An underappreciated gem, The Evil Within 2 holds nothing back when it comes to pants-ruining scares.

Ninja Theory's first Hellblade game is a shocking exploration of how fragile sanity can be, wrapped up in a thrilling action package, and genuine sincerity for mental conflicts that has to be seen and heard to be believed.

It's the atmospheric tone of a malicious and immense world that you explore where the real scares can be found, as the idea of being stripped of your individuality is a fear that everyone can understand. Throw in a haunting soundtrack, captivating design, and a chilling tale of oppression, and you've got all the ingredients for a good (and frightening!) time.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/inside-review/1900-6416458/">Inside review</a>.</em></p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/inside/c17gqf31d617">See on Xbox Store</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Prey</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/4055700-prey.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Trust no one, trust nothing, and definitely start running the second you see a coffee cup shaking violently. Prey is pure digital paranoia, a game dripping with retro-futurism style and enemies who can strike at anytime. You'll never know if you can trust your own eyes, and by the time the end credits roll on this sinister slice of insidious design, you'll be paranoid of your own surroundings in the real world.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/prey-review/1900-6416678/">Prey review</a>.</em></p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/prey/bqmvwcmb8p59">See on Xbox Store</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Scorn</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/4055701-scorn.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>If a good dose of body horror has been recommended by Dr. Cronenberg, then Scorn is the perfect medicine for anyone looking to explore a revolting world of bio-mechanical nastiness. Scorn doesn't rely on jump-scares to send a few chills down your spine, but the constantly unnerving atmosphere, creepy design, and repulsive creatures will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/scorn-review-pound-of-flesh/1900-6417976/">Scorn review</a>.</em></p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/scorn/9nm3tnrpqxlr">See on Xbox Store</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Secret Neighbor</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/4055702-secretneighbor.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Carrying on from where the nerve-wracking Hello Neighbor left off, Secret Neighbor adds a new twist to that game's formula of a nigh-unstoppable antagonist: Betrayal. It's hard enough to avoid being turned into a hood ornament by the mysterious murderer stalking a house that you're trapped inside of, but with a teammate ready to stab you in the back, you'll need eyes in the back of your head.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hello-neighbor-review/1900-6416829/">Secret Neighbor review</a>.</em></p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/secret-neighbor/9p7gbpgt90l3">See on Xbox Store</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Signalis</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/4055703-signalis.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Old-school suspense that's reminiscent of PlayStation-era classic games such as the first Silent Hill, Signalis uses top-down 2D pixel art to striking effect when you're forced into fight-or-flight scenarios.
