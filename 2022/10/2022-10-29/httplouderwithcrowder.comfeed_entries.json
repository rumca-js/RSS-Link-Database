YouTube has issued yet ANOTHER hard strike to the channel. No specifics have been provided but they claim that our segment on Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter takeover is a violation of their deliberately opaque guidelines.\n</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble\">\n\n</p><p>Why is this one more severe than the others? Well, it\u2019s our 2nd \u201cstrike\u201d in 90 days. 3 strikes mean permanent removal.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"67b54\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=32019162&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>Do you remember the reason for our last strike? <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/youtube-suspends-crowder-kari-lake\" target=\"_blank\">It was due to none other than Kari Lake pointing to election-related issues</a> for a primary IN WHICH SHE WON!!</p><p>\n\tLook, we are going into an election season. One where, if the scales of media were balanced, conservative Republicans would win in a landslide! They can\u2019t have that.\n</p><p>\n\tMake no mistake, there is a reason that these two strikes directly relate to:\n</p><ul>\n<li>A future governor who has spoken out against big tech</li>\n<li>Support of a man (Musk) whose purchase and plan for a big tech platform would fundamentally allow more free and fair media coverage of elections.</li>\n</ul><p>\n\tIt\u2019s also no coincidence that this happened as we were nearing 100,000,000 plays/downloads within 30 days. It\u2019s not about the number. It\u2019s about YOU choosing truth over their lies.\n</p><p>\n\tSo what do we do? Do we roll over and die? Hell no!\n</p><p>\n\tStarting Monday through November 17th (back on YouTube on November 21st), we will be streaming <a href=\"https://rumble.com/c/StevenCrowder\" target=\"_blank\">exclusively on Rumble</a> and of course the extended show on <a href=\"https://get.blazetv.com/lwc/\" target=\"_blank\">Mug Club</a> as we always do.\n</p><p>\n\tMake no mistake, the machine is in full force. They are deathly afraid of you and the tectonic shift which is beginning to take place in our country.\n</p><p>\n<span></span>Never give up, never surrender, and FIGHT LIKE HELL!!\n</p><p>\n\tSee you Monday.\n</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-pennsylvania-rally", "title": "'We went to 54 States': Joe Biden embarrasses himself in public again (no. 217 in a series)", "date_published": "2022-10-29 14:15:04+00:00", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32018627&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C118\" /><br /><br /><p>The big red supernova is set to wash over America in ten days, and Democrats are in a panic.

Because incoming <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kevin-costner-yellowstone-quits\" target=\"_blank\">Governor John Dutton</a> and Beth are supposed to be the good guys and Jamie is supposed to be the bad guy.  But the good guys aren't known to blackmail the bad guys in fictional dramas. It tends to go the other way. Yet you find yourself feeling bad for Jamie, the bad guy. All while Beth, a good guy, tortures him. See, the other thing with Beth Dutton -- and I'm sure she self-identifies this way -- is that she's a crazy bitch.</p><p>The only pure good guy in the entire Duttonverse is <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/yellowstone-cole-hauser-bar-fights\" target=\"_blank\">Rip Wheeler</a>.

[One incident], in which he hit his ex-girlfriend in front of two of their children at 5 a.m. in 2010, resulted in a 90-day prison sentence.'<br /></blockquote><p>Mayweather has also <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-brother-floyd-mayweathher\" target=\"_blank\">partied with Joe Biden's brother</a> in the past. It has nothing to do with this story. I just think it's funny.</p><p>To recap the Oscars drama in case you have been limiting your own social media use all year...</p><p>In March, Chris Rock made a joke about a movie at the Oscars that Will Smith found funny. The rub is that Will Smith's wife didn't find it funny, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/will-smith-chris-rock-oscars\" target=\"_self\">so Smith assaulted Rock on stage</a>. Smith's wife <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jada-pinkett-smith-laughing\" target=\"_self\">found THAT funny</a>, even though she is a <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jada-pinkett-smith-responds\" target=\"_self\">\"strong woman\" who \"didn't\" want her husband</a> to do that. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/adam-sandler-chris-rock-oscars\" target=\"_self\">The Grown-Ups were activated</a>. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-attacked-hollywood-bowl\" target=\"_self\">Jokes were made</a>.
