<p>Elon Musk has ordered company-wide layoffs at Twitter, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/29/technology/twitter-layoffs-musk-jobs.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. On Saturday, the SpaceX and Tesla executive reportedly told managers to begin drawing up lists of employees to cut. Twitter did not immediately respond to Engadget’s request for comment.</p><p><em>The Times</em> could not determine how much of Twitter’s workforce Musk plans to let go – though some teams will be more affected than others. Before completing his $44 billion <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html">takeover of the company</a>, Musk reportedly told investors he planned to lay off as much as 75 percent of Twitter’s 7,500-person strong workforce. In meeting with staff, Musk is said to have told employees he wouldn’t <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-wont-layoff-75-percent-of-staff-122948434.html">cut the company’s headcount so dramatically</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The forthcoming layoffs are likely to occur before November 1st. The timing may give Musk the opportunity to avoid paying out stock grants to outgoing workers. According to <em>The Times</em>, such payouts “typically represent a significant portion” of an employee’s pay. While Musk has shared some details about what <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-moderation-council-elon-musk-193142274.html">moderation</a> on the platform could look like under his watch, he's been less forthcoming about his plans for the company's workforce. On Saturday, he spent most of Saturday <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1586410852646674432?s=20&amp;t=0zRgrmhIUTgX1OenVrsYtA">tweeting about food</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Musk has already cut part of Twitter’s leadership team, firing CEO Parag Agrawal and Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal on the day he took ownership of the company. According to <em>The Guardian</em>, those moves are expected to cost Musk <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/28/twitter-bosses-120m-dollars-payout-elon-musk">at least $120 million</a> in “golden parachute” payouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While <em>The Witcher</em> won't return until <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-witcher-blood-origin-december-25-netflix-181659438.html">next year</a>, Netflix has already renewed the show for a fourth season and announced a major change. On Saturday, the streaming giant <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth">said</a> that Liam Hemsworth, best known for playing Gale Hawthorne in The Hunger Games film series, would replace Henry Cavill as protagonist Geralt of Rivia. The two actors posted about the casting change on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>"My journey as Geralt of Rivia has been filled with both monsters and adventures, and alas, I will be laying down my medallion and my swords," Cavill said <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CkTv9FyPnNz/?hl=en">on Instagram</a>. "In my stead, the fantastic Mr. Liam Hemsworth will be taking up the mantle of the White Wolf. As with the greatest of literary characters, I pass the torch with reverence for the time spent embodying Geralt and enthusiasm to see Liam’s take on this most fascinating and nuanced of men.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Cavill didn't share a reason for his departure. Earlier this week, the actor confirmed he would <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23420907/henry-cavill-superman-movies-black-adam-post-credits-scene">continue playing Superman</a> following his recent cameo appearance in <em>Black Adam</em>. Netflix cast Cavill as Geralt of Rivia in 2018. In addition to lending his star power to the series, the actor <a href="https://youtu.be/O7pzR7h7UDM">brought a genuine love</a> of the franchise with him that was apparent whenever he was interviewed about the role. "I really feel a connection to Geralt and who he is and his nature, especially from the books," he <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/12/30/21038318/witcher-geralt-voice-powers-henry-cavill-interview">told <em>Polygon</em> in 2019</a>. "And having played the game for many, many, many hours, it was something that I had a connection with."</p><p>Netflix did not share a release date for season four of <em>The Witcher</em>. Season three began filming earlier this year. At its recent Tudum fan event, the company said the show would return sometime in the summer of 2023. In the meantime, fans can look forward to watching <em>The Witcher: Blood Origin</em>, a prequel series starring Michelle Yeoh, starting on December 25th.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="407d9772c3c047cdb0d54c3c0104150b"><blockquote class="instagram-media" style="border: 0; margin: 1px; padding: 0; width: 99.375%;"><div style="padding: 16px;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CkTv8jXyj2l/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;" target="_blank"><div style="display: flex;"><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"></div><div style="display: flex;"><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; width: 60px;"></div></div></div><div style="padding: 19% 0;"></div><div style="display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;"></div><div style="padding-top: 8px;"><div style="color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal;">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style="padding: 12.5% 0;"></div><div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;"><div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px;"></div></div><div style="margin-left: 8px;"><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 20px; width: 20px;"></div><div style="width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent;"></div></div><div style="margin-left: auto;"><div style="width: 0px; border-right: 8px solid transparent;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12px; width: 16px;"></div><div style="width: 0; height: 0; border-left: 8px solid transparent;"></div></div></div><div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;"><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; width: 144px;"></div></div></a><p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CkTv8jXyj2l/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">A post shared by Liam Hemsworth (@liamhemsworth)</a></p></div></blockquote></div><p></p>

<p>Google has quietly acquired a startup that was working on using AI to generate avatars for social media users and brands. According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/google-acquires-twitter-backed-ai-avatar-startup-alter-for-100-million-source-says/"><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a>, the company recently paid about $100 million to buy Alter. The acquisition went through about two months ago without Google publicly announcing it. On Thursday, the search giant confirmed the purchase but did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. According to <em>TechCrunch</em>, Google bought Alter to better compete against TikTok.</p><p>Alter began life as Facemoji, offering a platform that other developers could use to add avatar creation systems to their apps and games. Alter chief co-founder and operating officer Jonathan Slimak recently took <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6deefbf2-941b-4156-9f41-a61ebb50d13d&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LinkedIn&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2ZGVlZmJmMi05NDFiLTQxNTYtOWY0MS1hNjFlYmI1MGQxM2QiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGlua2VkaW4uY29tL2ZlZWQvdXBkYXRlL3VybjpsaTphY3Rpdml0eTo2OTc3NjE5NDQyOTk4MzUzOTIwLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiM2E0YjdmNzQtNmEyZi00NWIwLWJmMWUtNWUxNTZjYTdjNDBmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAROTU-SU0z2DY4xnBdXjnhS5lpY3HZLBe505qESMXfu2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fupdate%2Furn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6977619442998353920%2F"><ins>to LinkedIn</ins></a> to share he was starting a position “building Avatars at Google.” How Alter’s team and technology could help Google better compete against TikTok is unclear.

<p>General Motors has temporarily stopped paying for advertisements on Twitter after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html">Elon Musk closed the $44 billion deal</a> to take over the website, according to the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/28/gm-temporarily-suspends-advertising-on-twitter-following-elon-musk-takeover.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>.

"There has been much speculation about why I bought Twitter and what I think about advertising. Most of it has been wrong," he wrote. He also said that advertising, "when done right, can delight, entertain and inform you..." For that to be true, "it is essential to show Twitter users advertising that is as relevant as possible to their needs."</p><p>Here is Musk's complete statement:</p><div id="0410b2e155304988b8d9400e0f8b5ece"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dear Twitter Advertisers <a href="https://t.co/GMwHmInPAS">pic.twitter.com/GMwHmInPAS</a></p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1585619322239561728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p></p>
