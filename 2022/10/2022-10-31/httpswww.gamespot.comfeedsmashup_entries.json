Modern Warfare 2's gameplay really feels like a refreshing return to old times again for Call of Duty, but unfortunately, the package as a whole feels lacking and gun customization is overly complex.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As a whole, Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer is the fast-paced shooter you expect it to be. The standard maps are scaled down for 6v6 matches this year, so there are less quiet and campy moments, and you're almost always finding yourself in the thick of the action. Modern Warfare 2 does dial back the overly fast-paced movement of recent years too, but that doesn't mean you can't choose a run-and-gun playstyle. The gameplay is just a bit less twitchy too, as the movement feels more on par with the original Modern Warfare series than the 2019 version.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sliding doesn't quite feel as fast and fluid as Modern Warfare 2019 and the bunny-hopping movement has been nerfed a little since the beta. You can still hop around a corner, but there's not a build-up of an overly-aggressive speed that lets you start hopping all over the map. This makes the multiplayer movement feel more grounded and slower-paced than the last few entries of the franchise, which is a great change. The last few years of Call of Duty has left the majority of the casual player base at a disadvantage in trying to counter the hopping and sliding frenzy.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-multiplayer-review-a-return-of-classic-mp-tarnished-by-poor-decisions/1900-6417992/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fatal-frame-mask-of-the-lunar-eclipse-gets-us-release-date/1100-6508771/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Fatal Frame: Mask Of The Lunar Eclipse Gets US Release Date", "date_published": "2022-10-31 20:47:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse will release digitally on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch on March 9, 2023.</p><p>The fourth entry in the beloved survival horror franchise, the game's plot concerns Ruka Minazuki, whose two friends died in an abandoned sanatorium on Rogetsu Isle.

Originally a villain of the Masters of Evil group, Williams worked for Baron Zemo and was a test subject for Zemo who gave Williams powers.

For the gamer in your life, there are plenty of options out there, but nothing is more durable (or comforting!) as a themed plush toy. Hug it, squeeze it, or display it on a shelf, a plush toy based on a video game character is a great quick gift that can easily be stuffed into a stocking. If you need a few ideas, we've got three steeply discounted plush suggestions below that you can look at, all designed by specialist company New Game Plush. As an added bonus, all three of these dolls come with a digital game code for Nintendo Switch, so that's essentially two gifts for the price of one.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove (Plush and game code)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056339-shovel-knight.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Shovel Knight is an indie gaming icon who has appeared in numerous games at this point. This particular doll captures the pixel-influenced design of the medieval warrior, retaining his simple charm and even bundling his trademark weapon alongside him in case any nefarious activity breaks out on your shelf.</p><p>This version of the game is the Treasure Trove edition, which packs in the original adventure with new tales starring Plague Knight, Specter Knight, and King Knight. There's also four-player local co-op mode, a co-op campaign, and several challenge modes to dig into.</p><p>It's worth noting that just the game itself normally costs $40, so you're getting a discount on the game and getting a plush to sweeten the pot.</p><div><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cipa0ZYU27u?u1=gs-gs29004430\">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div></div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Super Meat Boy Forever (Plush and game code)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056338-super-meat-boy.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>You could hit up your local butcher, grab a steak, and draw a face in it, or for a more hygenic celebration of Super Meat Boy, you could grab this adorable plushie instead. Plus, it won't spoil after a few days. This doll captures all the charm of the spectacular slab of meat, and packs in Super Meat Boy Forever for added digital nutritional value. If you're unfamiliar with the game, imagine tight platforming, brutal challenges, and constant squishy death that gives way to a feeling of undiluted satisfaction when you eventually clear a level.</p><div><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cipa1kX270T?u1=gs-gs29004430\">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div></div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Shantae and the Seven Sirens (Plush and game code)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4056337-shantae.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>One of the best-kept secrets in platform gaming, Shantae games are quirky and vibrant quests starring the plucky adventurer.

It's a film series that taught us if you are a teenage counselor at a camp for kids, and you're engaging in sex, drugs, or rock n' roll, there's a good chance a man in a hockey mask--or his mother or a paramedic--will kill you.</p><p>For nearly four decades, Jason Voorhees has been on a killing spree. Are you doing drugs in a cabin? You're dead. Are you making out with someone in a sleeping bag in the woods? You're dead. Are you on a boat trying to get to Manhattan? You are also dead. Trying to live your life in space? You're <em>super</em> dead.</p><p>Who doesn't love Jason and his signature hockey mask? Here's a part of Americana, and although he is a movie monster, we still want to celebrate him. Since the Friday the 13th film series kicked off in 1990--40 years ago--Jason has been on a killing spree. But how many people has he killed in each movie?</p><p>While we've ranked movies by box office totals and their overall quality in the past, this time around we're ranking the Friday the 13th movies by how many people Jason has killed in each movie. Obviously, if you're a fan of the series, then you know Jason wasn't the main killer in a couple of the movies in the franchise. Don't worry, we're also aware of that as well.</p><p>So going through the world of Jason Voorhees and all his horrific murders, here's every Jason movie, ranked by his body count. Additionally, Shout Factory released a boxed set of every movie in the franchise which includes deleted scenes from Friday The 13th: Part 2, which are part of the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-must-watch-friday-the-13th-part-2s-fabled-gore-cut/1100-6484134/\">legendary Gore Cut</a>. Additionally, you'll find services to stream every single one of these movies.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>12.

Tommy now lives in a halfway house for mentally ill teenagers. However, Jason has returned and is on a killing spree. Here's the crazy twist: it's not Jason committing the murders. It's a paramedic named Roy doing all the killing, and there are some really bizarre kills here, like eyes being gouged out by garden shears.</p><p><strong>Total Jason Voorhees kills:</strong> 0</p><p><em>Note: Roy killed 17 people.</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10.

The optional effect, which simulates the real-life ringing in ears that can be caused by close proximity to explosions and gunfire, is a fun addition to the franchise that's been around for some form or fashion for years now.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">However, not all shooter fans want to hear that effect for the hundreds of hours that they'll put into the game's multiplayer--especially if they suffer from real-life tinnitus. As such, this setting gives players the power to reduce its potency at will.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This setting has some players requesting other such settings. For example, one <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernWarfareII/comments/yflgdb/massive_shout_out_to_the_tinnitus_setting/\">Reddit</a> user suggests that you should be able to adjust the snow-white effect of flashbangs to black, in order to avoid blinding players in darkened rooms. <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/\">Battlefield 2042</a> added this setting, and players have encouraged other developers to follow suit.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-includes-toggleable-tinnitus-setting/1100-6508742/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-15-patch-notes-reveal-a-revamped-ui-but-no-legend-tweaks/1100-6508746/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Apex Legends Season 15 Patch Notes Reveal A Revamped UI, But No Legend Tweaks", "date_published": "2022-10-31 15:08:00+00:00", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/\">Apex Legends</a> Season 15: <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-15-start-date-catalyst-divided-moon-map-and-everything-we-know/1100-6508308/\">Eclipse</a>, is set to launch tomorrow, and developer Respawn Entertainment just posted the upcoming season's patch notes in a new blog on <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/eclipse-patch-notes\">EA's official Apex Legends website</a>. Of course, much of the changes aren't too shocking--the notes mention more about the new Broken Moon map, including the other two maps that will be in rotation this season: World's Edge and Olympus. This confirms players won't be seeing Storm Point or Kings Canyon in standard battle royale mode, at least not for the first half of the season.</p><p>But the one surprising part of the Season 15 patch notes isn't what they contain--it's what they don't contain: Any legend nerfs or buffs whatsoever. For a game that now boasts a cast of 23 playable legends (counting Season 15's newest addition to the squad, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/catalyst-guide-apex-legends/1100-6508542/\">Catalyst</a>), it's surprising how short the patch notes are--and they don't mention any legend ability tweaks.

But in general, I would say we've been a little light.\"</p><p>The Covid pandemic that began in 2020 had a big impact on the development of games as studios had to deal with new challenges, but Spencer explained that its developers had gotten these games on track and ready for 2023. \"We're excited about 2023 and we've talked about games that are coming,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cThose games are tracking well [and] we're out of what Covid did to the production schedule.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-knows-that-its-been-too-long-since-the-last-big-xbox-exclusive/1100-6508736/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-has-biggest-playstation-store-launch-of-all-time-for-cod-series/1100-6508735/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Has \"Biggest\" PlayStation Store Launch Of All Time For CoD Series", "date_published": "2022-10-31 12:42:00+00:00", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii/\">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</a> was just released on Friday, and it had a massive launch on PlayStation. The company has announced that Modern Warfare II has become the \"biggest PlayStation Store launch\" of all time for the Call of Duty series. This includes both preorders and day-one sales, Sony said.</p><p>Sony did not provide a specific sales number for Modern Warfare II on PlayStation, however. The game is seemingly performing well on other platforms, too (of course), as <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=gs-gs{{TYPE_ID}}{{CONTENT_ID}}-dtp-en&amp;murl=https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/all-games?cat=bestsellers\">Modern Warfare II ranks No. 1 on the Xbox best-seller list</a> and is <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/charts/\">topping the charts on PC via Steam as well</a>.</p><p>Video game sales across the industry are continuing to trend toward digital and away from physical, so it makes logical sense that Modern Warfare II would have set this digital PlayStation Store record. Modern Warfare II also achieved this sales record at a higher price: $70, which is the new normal for many AAA games. Just how well Modern Warfare II sold for physical copies relative to other games remains to be seen.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-has-biggest-playstation-store-launch-of-all-time-for-cod-series/1100-6508735/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-is-leaving-the-witcher-for-season-4-replaced-by-liam-hemsworth/1100-6508734/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Henry Cavill Is Leaving The Witcher For Season 4, Replaced By Liam Hemsworth", "date_published": "2022-10-31 12:26:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Henry Cavill is leaving Netflix's extremely popular The Witcher TV series. Netflix has confirmed that The Witcher 4 is coming back for a fourth season, but Cavill is dropping out, replaced as Geralt of Rivia by The Hunger Games star Liam Hemsworth. It's going to be a <em>long </em>time until we see Hemsworth as Geralt, however, as Season 3 doesn't arrive until Summer 2023, so Season 4 won't likely arrive until 2024 at the soonest.</p><p>\"My journey as Geralt of Rivia has been filled with both monsters and adventures, and alas, I will be laying down my medallion and my swords for Season 4,\" <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth\">Cavill said in a statement</a>. \"In my stead, the fantastic Mr. Liam Hemsworth will be taking up the mantle of the White Wolf. As with the greatest of literary characters, I pass the torch with reverence for the time spent embodying Geralt and enthusiasm to see Liam's take on this most fascinating and nuanced of men. Liam, good sir, this character has such a wonderful depth to him, enjoy diving in and seeing what you can find.\"</p><p>Cavill is announcing his departure from The Witcher around the same time that he confirmed <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-is-officially-back-as-superman-going-forward/1100-6508559/\">he's coming back to play Superman again in new DC projects. </a></p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-is-leaving-the-witcher-for-season-4-replaced-by-liam-hemsworth/1100-6508734/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}]
