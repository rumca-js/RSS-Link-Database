## Watch: Joe Biden embraces Jim Crow 2.0, takes part in Delaware's restrictive voting system

He leads a party that has deemed <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/voter-id-gop-ad" target="_blank">voter ID to be racist</a>. Joe Biden even went so far as to deem any common sense voter-integrity reform to be <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-tulsi-gabbard" target="_blank">the new Jim Crow</a>. Yet while Biden was quick to attack states like Georgia and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nancy-mace-texas-democrat-id" target="_blank">Texas</a>, his own home state of Delaware is just like Birmingham in the 50s. The state expects you to show ID before you vote.</p><p>Not only did Joe Biden not have the courage of his conviction to fight for voting rights in his home state, but he also took part in the problematic process of showing his ID as if he was Bull Conner in the 60s.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Here is Joe Biden eagerly showing his ID before voting in Delaware.<br /><br />Jim Crow 2.0? <a href="https://t.co/9g1iX86scW">pic.twitter.com/9g1iX86scW</a><br />— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) <a href="https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1586904137077489664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Look at this.

</p>
<p>Joe Biden, as far back as 2014, called voter ID laws an "<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-voter-id-laws-an-attempt-to-repress-minority-voting/" target="_blank">attempt to suppress minority voting</a>." Yet there he was eight years later, after not voting to change the laws in his home state, taking part in that attempt. He no doubt walked past black voters of color outside unable to vote because, as is the Democrat belief, black Americans of color lack the ability to obtain IDs on their own.</p><p>Though in Joe Biden's defense, he also doesn't think black people of color are able to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-vaccine-minorities" target="_blank">access the internet</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-black-entrepreneurs" target="_blank">hire a lawyer</a>, or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-junk-fees" target="_blank">purchase airline tickets</a> without his white democrat help. </p><p>Of course, everything Joe Biden and his Democrat party <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/voter-id-gop-ad" target="_blank">say about voter ID is bullplop</a>:</p><ul><li>Majorities of whites (74%), blacks (73%), and other minorities (82%) say voters should be required to show photo identification before being allowed to vote. </li><li>87% of black people have some form of confirmed photo ID. </li><li>90% of Latin Americans have a form of confirmed photo ID. </li><li>AND Voter ID laws have been shown to actually INCREASE turnout in states that recommend them, such as Georgia and Indiana.</li></ul><p>Yet Biden still attacks Voter ID laws as voter supression everywhere except where he lives. It may look like he was in a firehouse in 2022's Delaware. But it feels like he was on a plantation in 1822's South Carolina.</p><p><p>

## Sylvester Stallone reveals the shocking age he was before he knew what a 'republican' or 'democrat' was

That was the shocking revelation made during a recent interview with <em>The Sunday Times</em>. </p><p>I'm not sure of the context. The interview is behind a paywall and I'm biting off of <em><a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/sylvester-stallone-said-didnt-know-183831881.html" target="_blank">Yahoo News</a></em> which is his biting off of <em>Insider</em>. At some point during the interview, the interviewer from the UK publication must have asked, "So, tell me all you know about American politics. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-pennsylvania-rally" target="_blank">That Joe Biden is quite the nincompoop</a>, right?" </p><p>Stallone responded with how little he grew up paying attention to politics. And what forced him to have to pay attention.</p><blockquote>I didn't even know what a Republican or a Democrat was until I was 30 years old. I really didn't until I went to Hollywood.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="6f4b7" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32022688&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>It is shocking -- shocking -- that someone who managed the grow up apolitical was forced to choose a side when he went to Hollywood.</p><blockquote>I didn't know wrapping myself in a flag in 'Rocky' would throw down the gauntlet.</blockquote><p>C'mon, son. Everyone knows Apollo was the patriotic one.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="a1c38" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32022692&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>In fairness to Stallone, I can understand somewhat. I knew the difference between Republicans and Democrats as young as the second grade. Republicans were <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ronald-reagan-russian-jokes" target="_blank">Ronald Reagan</a> and Democrats were losers. I also knew, for the most part, I was a conservative. But I was, at the time, an MSNBC-watching New York version of a conservative.  Yeah, I know. I'm disappointed in me too.</p><p>It wasn't until more into adulthood-ish that I started paying closer attention and met people outside of the NY media bubble. It solidified the difference between the two parties. And confirmed more than ever that Democrats are losers, growing more extreme by the election cycle. While conservatives believe in freedom and have punch and pie.</p><p>This started around when I was thirty, so I get where Stallone is coming from. Some people don't pay attention to politics until they're forced to.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Bullies beat down girl in school common area, while bystanders and STAFFERS do nothing

All while the girl's mother records the beatdown without intervening. The bystanders are school staffers. This took place IN the school at Grant High School, in Portland.</p><p>Yes, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/biden-ice-cream" target="_blank">THAT Portland</a>. And yes, they <em>used</em> to have police officers in the school until the Democrat Party led the "defund the police" movement in the summer of 2020. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Female Portland school bullies pulverize girl in common room while staffer walks past and does NOTHING, triggering $1m lawsuit: Woke city banned school cops in wake of George Floyd's murder<a href="https://t.co/Xi54b4WZj1">https://t.co/Xi54b4WZj1</a> <a href="https://t.co/eHitb5xkGR">pic.twitter.com/eHitb5xkGR</a><br />— PXP Security & Inves (@PXPSecurityInve) <a href="https://twitter.com/PXPSecurityInve/status/1586932189140111361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The victim is only known as LS. She was charging an electronic device. There was an argument. Then the five-on-one beatdown started, leaving LS with contusions to her head, a swollen nasal bridge, muscle strain to her head and neck,  right shoulder pain and stiffness, and a rotator cuff injury. </p><p>As you see in the video, two of the bystanders already had their electronic devices charged. They were holding them pointed towards the melee they weren't stopping. And one pussy ran away when it started.</p><p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11368243/Portland-school-bullies-pulverize-girl-common-room-staffer-walks-past-does-NOTHING.html" target="_blank">The Daily Mail</a> is reporting her mother, Rahel Fessehazion is suing to the tune of $1.1 million dollars.</p><blockquote>Fessehazion allegest her daughter, a junior at the school, had been taunted by this group of girls since her freshmen year. During LS' freshmen year, administrators issued a no-contact order, which kept the girls in separate classes. The complaint also alleged the school only removed the girls from the school for a 'few days' after the fight, which caused LS to face 'further harassment and additional emotional injuries.' </blockquote><p>I guess we should look on the bright side. At least LS wasn't beaten so badly that she had a seizure. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/las-vegas-student-beaten-unconscious" target="_blank">We've seen that happen, also while the teacher did nothing</a>. </p><p>I would sue the bystanders too. It might not go anywhere. But I'd love to hear them be forced to defend their inaction in both a court of law and the court of public opinion.</p><p><p>

## Ghislaine Maxwell, sex trafficker, is so obsessed playing prison softball the other inmates gave her this nickname

	Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted sex trafficker to the stars and former associate of prominent democrat donor Jeffrey "I Didn't Kill Myself" Epstein, is having a fun time being incarcerated.  Maxwell was found guilty of sex trafficking minors. There is still no word about <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-maxwell-epstein" target="_self">Maxwell's client list</a> of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ghislaine-maxwell-israel-adesanya">powerful people she trafficked</a> underage girls for. But at least she is having fun playing softball!
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/r/entryeditor/2658573198#publish" target="_blank"><em>The Mirror</em></a> reports that Maxwell has become so obsessed with softball, the other prison inmates have given her the nickname "Dottie." You know, from that girl baseball movie.
</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>
	A prison source tells <em>The Mirror</em> that Ghislaine is very popular among the girls and very sociable.

She even almost won musical chairs one day, getting down to the last two!</p><blockquote>But it’s her love of softball she seems to most enjoy. Whenever there is a game, Ghislaine want to play. When she took to the field, they called her Dottie. It stuck.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="384bd" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32022058&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>It's not just softball. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ghislaine-maxwell-minimum-security" target="_blank">Maxwell was moved to FCI Tallahassee in July where she was afforded the luxury of living her best life</a>. If Ghislaine wished to learn a trade, the following were available: electrician, baker, horticulturist, plumber, and cosmology.</p><p>Also, to pass the time, Maxwell will be free to do pilates, lift weights, or play flag football and frisbee. She could also read a book in the recreational library. And she was able to continue teaching yoga as she was doing in Brooklyn.</p><p>But it's playing softball where Ghislaine Maxwell really shines! It's very <em>Shawshank Redemption</em> meets <em>A League of Their Own</em> meets <em>The Longest Yard</em> meets <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-maxwell-epstein" target="_blank">we still don't know why the media hasn't uncovered Maxwell's client list</a>.</p><p>Play ball!</p><p><p>

Not to be confused with Red Supernova Day a week from Tuesday. News broke on Friday that Elon Musk <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-twitter-managers" target="_blank">was looking to cut Twitter payroll by 50%</a>. Those cuts may have started last night as whatever the hell a "Senior Director of Platform Services" is announced he no longer has a job.</p><p>Taylor lashed out about it on Twitter, claiming: <em>"The ongoing layoff process is a complete farce and an embarrassment. It’s a bunch of Tesla goons making decisions about people they know nothing about other that number of code commits. It’s complete absurdity."</em></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The ongoing layoff process is a complete farce and an embarrassment.

I would never imply Taylor's criticism would have to do with him being yeeted out of a job, as unnecessary as his job title implies that job was.

Well, it would have caused a controversy if the people upset at him mattered. In the middle of this concert to raise money for Florida hurricane victims, he brought on stage Florida Governor <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-biden-hurricane-ian">Ron DeSantis</a>. The crowd loved it. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/luke-bryan-ron-desantis" target="_blank">Random idiots on Twitter were angry about it</a>.</p><p>Bryan responded to the media event, basically telling the haters to bless their heart: <em>"I grew up in a country where if a governor asks you if they can come and raise awareness to help victims of a natural disaster you help. I knew people would chatter about this but for me the more important piece was if I am going to come back there a few weeks after a large portion of people have been affected by a natural disaster in a state where people have been good to me this felt right. </em><em>This is all I am saying about this. I'll be outdoors with my boys."</em></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://t.co/edKiDb49ir">pic.twitter.com/edKiDb49ir</a><br />— Luke Bryan (@lukebryan) <a href="https://twitter.com/lukebryan/status/1586764256380436484?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>This was the offending action:<br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">DeSantis just walked out on stage at Luke Bryan. It’s deafening in here. <a href="https://t.co/WHelgPCxM1">pic.twitter.com/WHelgPCxM1</a><br />— Bonnie Upright, APR (@bonnieupright) <a href="https://twitter.com/bonnieupright/status/1586170370666549248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The rub is while IRL country music fans applauded Ron DeSantis, "country music" "fans" lashed out at Luke Bryan. They're very upset with the artist and swear they will never listen to his music ever again. Whether or not any of them ever listened to Bryan before or could name any songs is open for debate.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/LJMalcom/status/1586473132965056513" target="_blank">One person</a> with a Ukraine flag profile picture and a Ukraine flag emoji in her name cries: "I am so dismayed that you had DeSantis on stage with you. He embodies what is wrong with humanity; he pulls stunts that are racist and he is truly an evil man with no soul. I can no longer listen to your music in good conscious, you are a huge disappointment. "</p><p>Another person, when Luke Bryan said "ladies and gentlemen, Ron DeSantis" <a href="https://twitter.com/AmandaK982/status/1586474802130620416" target="_blank">misheard him and seems to think he said</a> "I hate women, LGBTQ people and immigrants."</p><p>Then come the potty mouths. <a href="https://twitter.com/lisa_liberal/status/1586418770582548482" target="_blank">One woman with the mouth of a truck driver said</a> "Well Luke Bryan can f@ck all the way off now."</p><p>But at least she censored herself. Another broad <a href="https://twitter.com/73MilitaryMama/status/1586455401897205760" target="_blank">with a Ukraine Flag emoji AND a schmaccine emoji</a> in her name did not: "Sad and seriously disappointing. F*ck you Luke Bryan."</p><p>And, some dinkus <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealHoarse/status/1586474298495016960" target="_blank">who claims to whisper to horses</a> whined: "Congrats to <a href="https://twitter.com/lukebryan" target="_blank">@lukebryan</a> on announcing he’s a bigoted piece of shit."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>After getting off stage, Ron DeSantis paid a visit to the most magical place on Earth -- Long Island -- to campaign for future governor Lee Zeldin.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">NY deserves a leader who will restore law & order. <a href="https://twitter.com/leezeldin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@leezeldin</a> is the man for the job.<br /><br />Lee will also protect NYers against irrational & liberty-infringing COVID mandates.<br /><br />The Zeldin victory on Nov 8th will be a shot heard ‘round the world!<br /><br />Support him:<a href="https://t.co/o1ZqqMuBBZ">https://t.co/o1ZqqMuBBZ</a> <a href="https://t.co/SZol7Plwu2">pic.twitter.com/SZol7Plwu2</a><br />— Ron DeSantis (@RonDeSantisFL) <a href="https://twitter.com/RonDeSantisFL/status/1586556231803707393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Shout out to Luke Bryan for refusing to bend the knee. If he issued a statement written by his PR team apologizing to those who were offended and promising to "educate himself," I would have been disappointed.</p><p><p>
