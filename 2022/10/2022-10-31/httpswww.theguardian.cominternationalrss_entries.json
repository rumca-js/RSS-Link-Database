It\u2019s not hard to imagine the terror that Pelosi must have felt as he made his coded phone call to the police, telling them that someone had broken into his San Francisco home. And it\u2019s all too easy to picture his assailant, David DePape, calling out, \u201cWhere\u2019s Nancy?\u201d, the same cry that went up from the insurrectionists roaming the halls of the US Capitol on 6 January.</p><p>In fact, the only thing that\u2019s hard to comprehend is why, given the current political climate, incidents like this one don\u2019t occur more often. According to the US Capitol police, there were 9,621 threats against members of Congress in 2021, and the frequency of those disturbing emails and phone calls appears to be increasing. Republican and Democrats alike have been warned that they and their families will be killed, and some have wisely taken advantage of the provision that allows them to use their campaign funds to pay for private security teams.</p><p>Francine Prose is a former president of Pen American Center and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/31/paul-pelosi-attack-nancy-pelosi-francine-prose\">Continue reading...</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/31/elon-musk-twitter-trump-tesla-longtermism", "title": "Like Trump, Musk reveals a vapid mind super-charged by wealth and ego | Siva Vaidhyanathan", "date_published": "2022-10-31 12:46:32+00:00", "description": "<p>Musk, despite his wealth, good fortune and global influence, is not a serious person \u2013 but he is toying with dangerous ideas</p><p>It took less than 48 hours for Elon Musk to reveal just how dangerous his new toy can be to this world.
