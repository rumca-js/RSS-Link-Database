  <p id="H8sHlo">Elon Musk wants Twitter to make money, and apparently, the first place he’s looking is its power users. Over the weekend, we learned that Musk plans to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/30/23431931/twitter-paid-verification-elon-musk-blue-monthly-subscription">charge $20 per month for a Twitter verification badge</a>, an update that might be rolled out next month. It’s a change that fits with Musk’s plans to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/7/23061198/elon-musk-double-twitter-revenue-through-subscriptions-blue">make Twitter’s premium subscription service more valuable</a> for its most active users. But verification serves a central trust-building role for Twitter — and Musk’s proposal could erode that trust just as the platform threatens to spiral out of control.</p>

<p id="Lk1EHl">At <em>The Verge</em>, we use threads <em>a lot</em>.

  <p id="7vZ75I">On November 1st, SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy is scheduled to<strong> </strong>launch into space for the first time since 2019. The giant rocket is slated<strong> </strong>to send<strong> </strong>payloads into orbit for the US Space Force tomorrow in a mission called USSF-44.</p>
<p id="TZYC2N">The mission is the first National Security Space Launch for the Falcon Heavy, the Space Force said in an emailed press statement.

Sometimes, he’s managed to watch the episode hours or even days before me and has already sent a message for me to listen to, while other times, I’ll be the first one to share my thoughts.

<p id="hIA6Xd">It has industry-leading stress tracking, improved comfort over the first-gen Sense model, and a redesigned user interface.
