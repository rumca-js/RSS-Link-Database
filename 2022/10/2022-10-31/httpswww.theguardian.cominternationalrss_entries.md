To achieve this aim, it has been necessary to strip migrants and refugees of their humanity: after all, most human beings do not tolerate harm being committed against those we see as “people like us”.</p><p>This brings us to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/oct/30/pressure-cooker-coaches-keep-arriving-at-manston-migrant-centre">Manston migrant processing centre</a>, in Kent, and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/oct/30/dover-petrol-bomb-immigration-centre-border-force">petrol bombs that were lobbed</a> on Sunday at a Dover Border Force immigration centre.

<p>Looking for a literary scare? Neil McRobert picks the must-read horror titles of the year so far</p><p>It’s that time of the year again. Spooky season, goth Christmas, All Hallow’s Eve. Whatever you call it, Halloween is traditionally when attention turns to the scarier end of the bookshelf. For horror fans it’s a period of fun and frustration. On the one hand, our genre gets its moment to shine darkly; on the other, we have to keep screaming that great horror is out there <em>all year round</em>!</p><p>2022 has been a particularly good vintage. In the case of Ally Wilkes’ <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/all-the-white-spaces-9781789097832">All the White Spaces</a></strong> (Titan Books £8.99) and Thomas Olde Heuvelt’s <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/echo-9781529331790">Echo</a></strong> (Hodder £9.99), icy shudders are delivered through hauntings at the Earth’s coldest extremities.

<p>Lazio manager left to lament dropping influential midfielder, only for him to get a damaging booking off the bench</p><p>Maurizio Sarri had wrestled all week with the question of whether to start Sergej Milinkovic-Savic against Salernitana. His Lazio team were soaring, up to third in Serie A and boasting the best defensive record in the division. A 2-0 win over the previously undefeated Atalanta, richly deserved despite the absence of top scorer Ciro Immobile, had put the manager back in the spotlight, the national media celebrating a rebirth of “<em>Sarrismo</em>” – Sarri-ism, often translated as Sarri-ball.</p><p>The manager was unaffected. In one interview he defended his enduring preference for wearing tracksuits, describing it as “the most natural thing in the world” to dress appropriately for your workplace and ridiculing under-19 coaches who wore jackets and trousers. In another he was asked to define <em>Sarrismo</em>. “I wouldn’t know what to call it,” he said. “Maybe my wife is the one who knows best how to define me: a grumpy man and a bit of a dickhead.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/oct/31/sarri-full-of-rage-and-remorse-after-milinkovic-savic-mess-costs-lazio">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With the right ethical safeguards, could ‘challenge trials’ defend against future pandemics?</p><p>In the 1770s an English doctor called Edward Jenner noticed that milkmaids didn’t seem to catch smallpox, the terrifying disease that caused around a third of the people who caught it to die. He thought that their frequent exposure to cowpox, a similar but less severe virus, might be what protected them. In order to test his hypothesis he gave his gardener’s eight-year-old son cowpox and then <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1200696/" title="">deliberately infected him with smallpox</a> to see if he had become immune. He had, and Jenner successfully repeated the experiment. “Vaccination”, from the Latin word for cow, soon became commonplace.</p><p>It was of course highly irresponsible to expose a child to a deadly disease with no sure knowledge that he would survive. Even so, with hindsight, we can see that the benefits were immense: the vaccine was safe and highly effective. Demonstrating that fact and publicising it encouraged untold numbers of others to follow suit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/31/should-we-give-people-diseases-to-develop-cures">Continue reading...</a>

There were no two ways about it: not in the fourth of five matches in the T20 World Cup group stage, with the chunk of net run rate that the hosts needed to make up on England. Midway through the night, that chance was there, with Ireland 25 for five in reply to a mid-range 179. By the end of the night it had slipped away, with young Irish wicketkeeper Lorcan Tucker playing an innings of consummate class to score 71 not out and take Ireland to 137 all out: not a winning total but enough to leave a mark on Australia’s campaign.</p><p>The first stick in the spokes for the home side was Ireland winning the toss and choosing to bowl, given that a run-rate boost is more feasible when chasing a small target quickly, while batting first requires making a huge total to defend.

<p>Setting one’s unease at delighting in hi-tech warfare aside, this is a  precisely tooled, intensely immersive combat simulator</p><p>It is almost comforting in this era of “games as a service”, where franchises exist as endless monetisation machines designed to consume every second of our free time, that Call of Duty still gets an annual retail release. Once upon a time, these games sold 30m copies a year, and people queued outside stores at midnight to buy them. Those days are gone, but Modern Warfare II shows there is still guilty pleasure to be had in these ridiculous yearly instalments of macho combat gymnastics.</p><p>The campaign story takes place three years after the close of 2019’s Modern Warfare. The newly created Task Force 141 is sent to track down an Iranian terrorist who has somehow acquired a set of American nuclear missiles. It’s slickly produced, fast-moving stuff, ricocheting around the world, from the Middle East to Mexico, while gruff guys yell macho spec-ops phrases at each other. En route, there are a few spectacular set-pieces. A section where you infiltrate a convoy of military vehicles as it zooms along a civilian highway might be one of the best driving sequences I’ve ever played in a mainstream shooter; and there’s a brilliant gun fight on the deck of a cargo boat in rough seas, where massive shipping containers slide all over the place, squishing unwary combatants.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/oct/31/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-review-new-thrills-from-the-old-campaigner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Nosferatu to A Nightmare on Elm Street, LGBTQ+ viewers have long detected a queer undertone in many horror films. Now the genre is bringing its gay subtext to the surface</p><p>Australian director Jennifer Kent didn’t set out to make a queer classic when she wrote and shot <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/23/the-babadook-review-chilling-freudian-thriller" title="">The Babadook</a>, a clever, sneakily terrifying independent film about a single mother and son terrorised by a strange supernatural entity sprung from the pages of a shabby children’s picture book. Certainly no critics read it as such as the film made its way round the festival circuit in 2014, scooping acclaim and awards aplenty.</p><p>However, the internet had other ideas. Over the next few years, various wags of Tumblr began to insist that the film’s eponymous monster – a towering charcoal-sketched ghoul with a stovepipe hat, icepick fingers and an inordinate number of sharply rectangular teeth – was in fact a gay icon. Gradually, what began as a joke became a meme, and eventually an insistent theory: LGBTQ+ fans of the film, declaring themselves “babashook”, likened the onscreen family’s fear of the weird, fangy beast to the panic and hostility that often greets the presence of queerness in predominantly straight households. Sure enough, Babadook images and costumes began to appear at Pride events; in 2019, the film’s US distributor IFC Films even issued a limited Pride edition of the film on Blu-ray. “I feel it’s really quite beautiful, but I still have no idea why,” Kent said of the film’s queer appropriation. “I guess he’s an outsider of sorts. It’s funny.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/oct/31/queer-horror-cinema-babadook-frankenstein">Continue reading...</a>

## Something in the Dirt review – meta DIY sci-fi is a paean to LA esoterica

<p>Conceived during the pandemic, the latest from Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead is a transcendent head-scratcher about two slackers’ search for hidden meanings and paranormal signs</p><p>Between the likes of Host, Bo Burnham’s Inside and Jacob Estes’s He’s Watching, there’s a respectable pandemic oeuvre emerging – and Something in the Dirt is one of the best yet. This sci-fi-dusted paean to Los Angeles slackerdom is fairly typical for the lockdown genre: a torrent of self-involved invention about not much more than the process of its own creation. But director-stars Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead approach their two-hander with a sly humour and wonderment that prevents it from disappearing up its own fundament.</p><p>The film could also be plausibly filed in the LA esoterica category, alongside Mulholland Drive and Under the Silver Lake. Drifter John (Moorhead) moves into the same apartment complex as long-time denizen Levi (Benson), where they witness a strange, scintillating anomaly in his living room that levitates a crystal ashtray and creates spiral patterns on the wall. Initially believing it to be a ghost, they decide to make a documentary about it to snare a Netflix deal. Then Levi, an unblinking adherent to an apocalyptic church, begins noticing these same geometrical patterns everywhere around the city, in brickwork, signs and the like.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/oct/31/something-in-the-dirt-review-diy-sci-fi-justin-benson-aaron-moorhead">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva takes over a deeply divided country, and a congress dominated by rightwing parties</p><p>The Workers’ party (PT) supporters were out in force last night in the centre of São Paulo, pretty much as they were 20 years ago when Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva first won the Brazilian presidency.

That could apply to the decline of a team who were challenging on all fronts six months ago, have reached the knockout stage of the Champions League, yet find themselves adrift in the title race having dropped points in eight of 12 matches this season. But it was the word Jesse Marsch used to describe Leeds’ first win over Liverpool since April 2001 – prefixed by “almost”, admittedly – as the under-pressure manager savoured the release of a dramatic late victory at Anfield. The emotional celebrations were understandable but did not cloud Marsch’s assessment that Leeds cannot waste the chance to launch their season. With three of the current top four to play after Bournemouth’s visit to Elland Road next Saturday, his realism made sense. “We should not be in this position, we should not be suffering the way we are,” said Marsch. “But we haven’t found ways to reward ourselves. Part of it is we are a young team. We needed a moment in our season to stop the bleeding and to get it here is almost inconceivable. But we can’t just rely on one game. We need to build momentum in our season.” <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/oct/29/liverpool-leeds-premier-league-match-report">Match report: Liverpool 1-2 Leeds</a></p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/oct/29/graham-potter-admits-he-looks-a-bit-of-a-fool-after-chelseas-defeat-to-brighton">Match report: Brighton 4-1 Chelsea</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/oct/31/premier-league-10-talking-points-weekend-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>FW Murnau’s eerie chiller might have been seen as a legally problematic Dracula rip-off at the time, but has endured since</p><p>It feels right, the knowledge that Nosferatu has been around for a full century. A few years after its 1922 release, the odds were not in its favor: in 1924, the studio behind FW Murnau’s silent horror film agreed to destroy all copies of the film, as part of a copyright infringement case pursued by Florence Balcombe, the widow of the Dracula author Bram Stoker. Nosferatu is not technically an adaptation of Dracula, in the sense that it was produced without the permission of Stoker’s estate and changed the names of all major characters, as well as the setting and some of the story. But it is more than close enough to inspire legal action (and supposedly the original German intertitles even acknowledged the book), which is why it was essentially sentenced to death following its original run.</p><p>Befitting the subject of vampirism (if not the specific brand of vampirism practiced therein), the movie not only came back to life, but spread, in both its influence and the sheer number of versions, some lovingly restored and some simply bastardized, that have circulated over the years – including during the streaming age. For the curious, plenty of services, including a number of free ones like Tubi, carry a version of Nosferatu, though your best bet is probably the one streaming on the Criterion Channel. It features the correct color-tinting, intertitles, and running time (some versions are sped up), and generally looks terrific for a 100-year-old movie whose studio attempted to destroy all copies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/oct/31/nosferatu-silent-horror-movie-100-years">Continue reading...</a>

He hasn’t slept in three days but is perfectly lucid and the weariness only tells in his minute corrections: “No, let me rephrase that”; “Sorry, let me think.” He is 70 years old, wrung out, back in Australia where he was born and raised, talking to me while fielding frequent phone calls. Has he no plans just to hang out for a bit, see some cousins? He’s a bit bemused by the question: “That’d be a very fine thing. But after Qatar I’ve got two other campaigns coming up – quiet time would be a stretch. I, with many others, have contributed to so many positive changes. It’s a great motivator.”</p><p>The protest in Qatar, which happened on 25 October, comprised only Tatchell and a colleague, Simon Harris, from Tatchell’s <a href="https://www.petertatchellfoundation.org/">eponymous foundation</a>. It featured a single placard, which they had smuggled into the country between the pages of a copy of the Daily Telegraph. “The only existing broadsheet newspaper today,” he says, pleased at the irony of the paper coming in handy, despite itself. The wording on the placard was: “Qatar arrests, jails &amp; subjects LGBTs to ‘conversion’ #QatarAntiGay.” “I never dictated the terms,” he says. “I took the message directly from my contacts in Qatar.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/oct/31/ive-had-hundreds-of-death-threats-hundreds-of-violent-assaults-peter-tatchell-on-homophobia-hope-and-qatar">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If Britain’s first Asian prime minister is meant to be a high mark for progress, let’s not forget the inequalities his politics create</p><p>There is a TikTok meme doing the rounds where users mime along to an audio clip. “A win is a win,” it goes, as an unseen crowd objects and jeers, “a win is a win, I don’t care what y’all saying.” The joke is that sometimes things are so bad that you have to massively inflate tiny mercies in order to cope. Stuck on a flight that was so delayed that you missed your own wedding but got free drinks? A win is a win. <br /><br />Celebrating Rishi Sunak’s rise to the premiership feels very much like “a win is a win” territory. The first British Asian prime minister finally walked into No 10 after a historic meltdown of government (twice); after he was rejected by his party membership; and then after not giving that membership the choice at all the second time. It was truly <em>not</em> our “Obama moment”. Still, recognition of this “historic” occasion was issued by his party and the opposition frontbench. A win is a win.</p><p>This is now the template for measuring racial progress – take what you’re given and be grateful. As another Black History Month draws to a close, it is becoming clear the occasion is becoming more corporate, performative and depoliticised with every passing year. In my head now, it is just another secular event on the calendar, like Halloween or Thanksgiving. Instead of pumpkins, it’s black people decorating the premises. For a few weeks, a few of them get paid, some white people sit through their mandated talks, and maybe some kids get to learn something not deemed important enough to be included in their curriculum every other month. The Black Lives Matter summer of 2020 began as an epic global movement of street protests, and it’s ended up as an annual presentation. </p><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/31/rishi-sunak-win-emptiness-elite-diversity-rhetoric-inequalities">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kremlin pulls out of grain deal after drone attack on Russia’s Black Sea flagship vessel in Crimea; UN and US call on Moscow to reverse its decision</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy claimed his forces repelled a “fierce offensive” by Russian troops in the eastern Donetsk region.</strong> “Today they stopped the fierce offensive actions of the enemy,” Zelenskiy said in his Sunday night <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/u-krayini-sogodni-ne-bulo-avarijnih-vidklyuchen-ale-deficit-78805">address</a>. “The Russian attack was repelled.” The fiercest fighting in Donetsk region has been around the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka.</p><p><strong>Russia’s Black Sea flagship vessel, the Admiral Makarov, was damaged and possibly disabled during an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/30/russias-black-sea-flagship-damaged-in-crimea-drone-attack-video-suggests">audacious Ukrainian drone attack</a></strong> over the weekend on the Crimean port of Sevastopol, according to an examination of video footage. Open-source investigators said the frigate was one of three Russian ships to have been hit on Saturday. A swarm of drones struck Russia’s navy at 4.20am. Aides to Zelenskiy hinted the country was behind the well-orchestrated raid, though his government has not claimed responsibility.</p><p><strong>In the wake of the Sevastopol attack the Kremlin said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/29/russia-suspends-ukraine-grain-deal-after-attack-on-sevastopol-naval-base?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other">it was pulling out of a UN-brokered grain deal</a></strong> that allows civilian ships to export grain and fertiliser from Black Sea ports. Russia claimed it could not “guarantee safety of civilian ships” travelling under the pact after the attack on its Black Sea fleet. Zelenskiy, however, said Moscow was looking for a pretext to end the initiative. It had been “deliberately aggravating” the food crisis since September, he said <a href="https://web.telegram.org/k/#@V_Zelenskiy_official">in a video address</a>.</p><p><strong>The international community condemned Russia’s decision to suspend the UN-brokered Black Sea grain initiative</strong>. US president Joe Biden described the move as “purely outrageous” while US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Russia was weaponising food. The European Union called on Russia to reverse its decision. “Russia’s decision to suspend participation in the Black Sea deal puts at risk the main export route of much-needed grain and fertilisers to address the global food crisis caused by its war against Ukraine,” EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said.</p><p><strong>The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said he was “deeply concerned”</strong> by Russia’s suspension of the deal and delayed his departure to attend the Arab League summit in Algiers for a day to try to revive it. Russia requested a meeting on Monday of the UN’s security council to discuss the issue. Guterres was engaged in “intense contacts” to get the agreement back and <a href="https://twitter.com/JosepBorrellF/status/1586723377640837120">spoke to the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell.</a></p><p><strong>The United Nations, Turkey and Ukraine said they will press ahead to implement a Black Sea grain deal with a transit plan in place for 16 ships on Monday</strong>, despite Russia suspending its participation in the pact. The UN, Nato, the EU and the US have all urged Russia to reverse its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/29/russia-suspends-ukraine-grain-deal-after-attack-on-sevastopol-naval-base">decision to pull out of the deal</a>. In a statement, the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul, where Russian, Ukrainian and Turkish and UN personnel are working, said the three delegations had also agreed for inspections to be provided on Monday to 40 outbound vessels.</p><p><strong>Kyiv’s infrastructure ministry said on Sunday that 218 vessels were now “effectively blocked” in its ports</strong> – 22 loaded and stuck at ports, 95 loaded and departed from ports, and 101 awaiting inspections.</p><p><strong>Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, expressed “hope” that Joe Biden will recall the 1962 Cuban missile crisis</strong> <strong>when dealing with the war in Ukraine.</strong> In an interview for a Russian state television documentary on Sunday, Lavrov said there were “similarities” between the ongoing war in Ukraine and the 1962 confrontation. “I hope that in today’s situation, President Joe Biden will have more opportunities to understand who gives orders and how,” Lavrov said. “The difference is that in the distant 1962, Khrushchev and Kennedy found the strength to show responsibility and wisdom, and now we do not see such readiness on the part of Washington and its satellites,” he added.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/31/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-250-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
