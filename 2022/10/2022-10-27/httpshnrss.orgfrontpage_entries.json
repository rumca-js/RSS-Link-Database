We are Andres and Edgar and we are building MovingLake (<a href=\"https://movinglake.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://movinglake.com</a>). We are creating real-time, bidirectional data connectors which aim to solve automated ETL (eg moving data from an API to Snowflake), reverse ETL (we pipe the data straight to your CRM instead of going through the data warehouse),  and transactional integrations (e.g. for an ERP integration) in one swoop. Polling, webhooks, websockets, REST, GraphQL, SOAP\u2014we merge it all into one reliable, replayable, real-time data stream which can be sent anywhere.<p>Here are two demos: Whatsapp to Google Sheets (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Qy4eInGgIhw\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/Qy4eInGgIhw</a>) and Postgres to Webhooks (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/cmrkUan8o1w\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/cmrkUan8o1w</a>).<p>Moving data around is still difficult and a pain. Companies spend thousands of hours and lots of money making data pipelines. General solutions are difficult in that there are too many sources and too many destinations. It also entails a ton of schlep that no one really wants to deal with. At the same time, the API / data connector market is vast. Even when there are already multiple billion-dollar companies in the space, we continue to see big verticals unattended.<p>We previously worked at big tech as well as have been CTOs of Series B startups in Latam. We got into this problem when we had the experience of paying for pre-built data connectors, but at the same time having to do custom integrations to the API, at which point it didn\u2019t make sense to have a paid data connector. After a few paid connectors and manual connectors we thought that there should be an event-driven, realtime data connector company which could solve all of our API integration needs in one go.<p>We also are not huge believers in operationalizing the data warehouse, i.e. the trend to use the data warehouse as a processing tool out of which data is extracted and pushed to other systems. Since data warehouses are built on an OLAP frame of mind, we think using it as a computation source for automated workflows is not the best idea. At MovingLake we propose using rather realtime connectors with a transformation pipeline which is specifically designed to do these things.<p>We combine polling with webhooks and websockets to provide a single reliable stream. If there's websockets, we use them. If there's webhooks we use them. If there's only GET endpoints then we poll as fast as the API lets us. Either way we ensure you'll get the data as fast as possible.<p>We provide destination adapters so that this data can be sent anywhere to as many destinations as you want for the same price. We provide CDC (Change Data Capture) plugins for databases to pull data as it is written and then send it anywhere. We also provide automatic JSON to SQL converters with Schema Evolution.<p>On our roadmap we still have to add the data transformation layer as well as add support for more bidirectional connectors.<p>\u201cGet started\u201d on our home page takes you to a \u201cbook a demo\u201d thing, but there\u2019s an open beta at <a href=\"https://app.movinglake.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://app.movinglake.com</a> which everyone is welcome to try out. Everything is free for now, though eventually we\u2019ll have to charge. Although we wanted to charge a standard fee per event extracted, this would have tied our hands to deliver tougher-to-build connectors. So most of our connectors are charged at $0.00004 per event, but some which include scraping are charged higher (we want to be very explicit about which connectors are charged differently).<p>Please let us know what you think! Roasting our product would be super helpful :)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33359870\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33359870</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cd-projekt-is-remaking-the-first-i-witcher-i-game-in-unreal-engine-5", "title": "CD Projekt is remaking the first Witcher game in Unreal Engine 5", "date_published": "2022-10-27 16:17:52+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cd-projekt-is-remaking-the-first-i-witcher-i-game-in-unreal-engine-5\">https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cd-projekt-is-remaking-the-first-i-witcher-i-game-in-unreal-engine-5</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33359835\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33359835</a></p>\n<p>Points: 38</p>\n<p># Comments: 20</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.01.026", "title": "Real-time dialogue between experimenters and dreamers during REM sleep (2021)", "date_published": "2022-10-27 16:15:43+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.01.026\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.01.026</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33359802\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33359802</a></p>\n<p>Points: 15</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/hydroelectric-power", "title": "Why Is Hydroelectricity So Green, and yet Unfashionable?", "date_published": "2022-10-27 16:15:01+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hydroelectric-power\">https://spectrum.ieee.org/hydroelectric-power</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33359790\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33359790</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 9</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://BigBalli.com/blog/how-to-backup-firebase-realtime-database", "title": "How to backup Firebase realtime database when the payload is too large (256MB)", "date_published": "2022-10-27 15:48:20+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://BigBalli.com/blog/how-to-backup-firebase-realtime-database\">https://BigBalli.com/blog/how-to-backup-firebase-realtime-database</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33359373\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33359373</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33359329", "title": "Ask HN: How do you maintain your daily log?", "date_published": "2022-10-27 15:45:41+00:00", "description": "<p>A few years ago, I read an excellent article on HN [0], which recommended keeping a daily log in a simple text file. I've been following this advice. Recording many short entries over a day is very useful for me. I can easily find items for my performance review, leave notes for myself, etc.<p><i>Questions</i>:<p>1. What is your workflow?<p>2. What tools do you use?<p>3. If you log to a text file, how do you format your entries?<p><i>My framework</i><p>Daily log vs. daily journal<p>For me, entries in a daily journal require deeper thought and reflection on what you have done, your goals, etc. Usually, journaling is done 1-2 times/day. Conversely, entries in a daily log concern immediate actions and are done many times a day. However, your daily log could inform entries in your daily journal.<p>Daily log vs. a to-do list<p>For me, entries in a to-do list are only the things you need to do. Also, most to-do lists I've seen don't store the timestamp of when a to-do item was created. Conversely, entries in a daily log are more diverse and are all timestamped. They may include to-do items but don't have to. My entries are updates, notes, questions, and to-dos.<p>My log is a markdown file, which I edit in Sublime Text. I created Espanso [1] shortcuts to add timestamped entries. E.g., \"zzq\" expands to \"[2022-10-26 10:45:24]: Question []:\" and \"zzn\" expands to \"[2022-10-26 10:45:56]: Note:\". For proper task/to-do management, I use Amazing Marvin [2], which is decent.<p><pre><code>   [2022-10-23 09:18:44]: Update: prepared slides for meeting with @Laura   #1on1 #projectLion\n\n   [2022-10-23 10:54:36]: Note: I created a new keystore key using these instructions https://xxx.xxx, stored in keys dir #projectGamma\n\n   [2022-10-23 11:16:54]: TODO [x]: deploy a new build, which fixes the bug with incorrectly parsed dates (id:1332); [2022-10-24 10:12:12]: rolled out, v17 (2.0-17) #projectGamma\n\n   [2022-10-23 12:27:56]: TODO []: ask about daily log software on HN @me\n\n   [2022-10-23 13:38:00]: Note: password for W in stored in LP #projectGamma\n\n   [2022-10-23 13:43:25]: Question [x]: should the style guide be in the repo or YouTrack? @Alex #weeklymeet #projectGamma; [2022-10-25 15:17:13]: @alex said in YT because we'll use it in other projects\n\n   [2022-10-23 14:11:15]: Question []: should we use Red Frames (https://github.com/maxhumber/redframes) in addition to Pandas? Criteria for decision? @me #projectLion\n</code></pre>\n<i>What do you want to improve and why?</i><p><pre><code>   - I need an easier way to find, e.g., all questions from this week for @Alex about #projectGamma. I'd like to easily filter entries by date, project (#projectGamma), person (@Alex), and type (Update, Question). \n\n   - Nice to have but not required:\n    - sort entries by status (not done: [], done: [x])\n    - auto-timestamp when a to-do item was created and completed\n    - surround selected text with [], {}, \"\" and auto-close them like a programming text editor, e.g., ST, VSCode\n    - duplicate & move entries via shortcuts\n</code></pre>\n<i>What have you looked into?</i><p><pre><code>   - People enjoy Obsidian [3] and Logseq [4]. I find them alluring too, but I don't yet know how to make them support my daily log. I'd need to spend at least a full day to figure out each of them, the time I don't have at the moment. (I use Obsidian for code snippets; it is excellent.)\n\n   - Org-mode is very popular, but emacs and vim are way too much of a time investment (I tried many times before). Do share your evil and holy workflows, though. There are org-mode extensions for other text editors and EasyOrg [5]. I still need to try them.\n\n   - I like the todo.txt format [6] and I am considering forking pter [7], but making it fit my needs would take quite a bit of work. \n</code></pre>\n<i>Dealbreakers:</i><p><pre><code>   - No Windows version\n\n   - No desktop app\n\n   - Subscription-based software, including charging for syncing between computers\n\n   - No export option\n</code></pre>\nLinks posted in a comment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a
