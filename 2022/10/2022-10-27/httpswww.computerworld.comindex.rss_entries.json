But we're likely to see more such crises in the future. How successfully we handle them will depend on what happens and how politicians and corporate executives respond. One thing that's clear is that flexibility and foresight will be needed as companies sort out what comes next.</p><p>For example, it seemed clear a year ago that practically everyone in office jobs would remain largely remote, so companies realized they needed occasional on-premises collaboration spaces that were small and intimate. (These were often called huddle rooms.)</p><p>Now, companies are talking about large conference rooms again as they envision people coming back to the office en masse \u2014 largely because they never addressed the issues that cropped up with the shift to remote work. Those problems include workers who felt like they didn't have the same opportunities as on-site employees and managers who either don\u2019t know how to manage remote employees or simply don't trust them to do their jobs.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"/article/3678288/as-videoconferencing-needs-change-its-time-to-plan-for-what-comes-next.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.computerworld.com/index.rss", "link": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/3678189/apple-improves-icloudcom-for-better-ease-of-use.html#tk.rss_all", "title": "Apple improves iCloud.com for better ease of use", "date_published": "2022-10-27 15:14:00+00:00", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p>Apple is testing improvements to<a href=\"https://beta.icloud.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">\u00a0iCloud.com</a>\u00a0designed to make it easier to use \u2014 and has unveiled a new look and a few new tricks to reflect features recently introduced in its operating systems.</p><h2><strong>iCloud services for the rest of us</strong></h2>\n<p>If you are one of the millions who use iCloud with their iPhone but no other Apple product, you probably use the online service to access your digital content from other devices.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.icloud.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">iCloud</a> is Apple\u2019s sync service that <a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3661355/the-essential-guide-to-icloud-login.html\">acts as a secure online supporting actor</a> for many of the apps and services its customers use.

These could be related to hardware problems, Windows updates gone bad, device or driver issues, and a whole lot more.</p><p>I keep all these tools on a single USB drive that I like to call the ultimate bootable Windows repair drive. Interested in building your own? You just need a modestly sized (256GB or 512GB) USB drive and the right software. This kind of setup works splendidly with Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, and 11 installations.</p><p>My technique relies on a special foundational tool called Ventoy, along with a collection of ISO files from which Ventoy will boot a Windows PC. The first part of this story introduces and explains Ventoy. The second part explains that improved performance may justify the cost of an NVMe SSD and a compatible USB drive enclosure. The third introduces a carefully curated collection of ISO files, with brief explanations of what they can do, what they contain, and where to find and download them.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"/article/3626363/build-the-ultimate-bootable-windows-repair-drive.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>", "favourite": false}]
