Sources to the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website have it on good authority that <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kari-lake-town-hall-hobbs" target="_blank">Kari Lake</a> could be getting arrested over the weekend if she hasn't been already.</p><p>Because Lake just MURDERIZED her opponent <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/katie-hobbs-uber-driver" target="_blank">Katie Hobbs</a>.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">911, I'd like to report a murder <a href="https://t.co/kakp2GC3sI">https://t.co/kakp2GC3sI</a><br />— Jorge Bonilla (@BonillaJL) <a href="https://twitter.com/BonillaJL/status/1585717059085901825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Side note: if you are reading an LWC post and it accidentally says Lake is running against "Katie Holmes," it finally snuck past copy editing.

</p>
<p>Lake's new ad focuses on a recent Katie gaffe about Hispanic voters. Hobbs -- who is a statewide elected official, mind you -- was asked what lessons she learned from her Hispanic constituents. All she could come up with was that her sister-in-law is teaching her Espanol. That's Spanish for "Spanish."</p><p>When the reporter followed up if Hobbs couldn't name a single lesson she has learned from 1/3 percent of the state, her answers were as follows:</p><p>"Uh"</p><p>"Um"</p><p>"(Nervous Laughter)"<br /></p><p>"Uhm."</p><p>Hobbs couldn't <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jill-biden-tacos-journalist" target="_blank">even think of Mexican food</a> like some other Democrats. I was embarrassed for her. Then I remembered she sucks at life and started laughing.</p><p>I'm not sure how many points Lake is putting behind this ad on Arizona television. But a recent Insider Advantage poll has her up by ELEVEN PERCENT. It's an outlier, but IA is also a decent polling firm. If this video gets put on the air, the other polls will be catching up.</p><p>Exit question: What do you think Katie Hobbs would prefer at this point: having to sit for another Latino media hit, or taking Lake up on her suggestion <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kari-lake-milk-bull" target="_blank">she should try milking a bull</a>? I think Hobbs would rather grab the bull by the udder and pray for the best.</p><p><p>

## Taylor Swift lets her haters win, edits video that random people on social media called 'fatphobic'

After a few random people complained about Taylor Swift's new video, the artist has caved and deleted the offending scene. All five seconds of it. Five seconds of Taylor standing on a scale and the scale saying "fat."</p><p>As reported <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/taylor-swifts-anti-hero-music-video-edited-after-critics-call-it-fatphobic" target="_blank">by the Daily Wire</a>, fans noticed the scene was edited from her “Anti-Hero” music video on Apple Music and later on YouTube. In the new version, Swift steps onto the scale, two different Taylors look down (you have to watch the video for it to make sense), and the scale shows no message.</p><p>This a screen capture from the five seconds that randos on social media deemed "fatphobic." And got as angry at Taylor Swift as they do McDonald's when the milkshake machine is broken again.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="276a0" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32000724&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>The controversy abides by <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-jk-rowling" target="_blank">the rule of three</a>, where as long as <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/scooby-doo-velma-video-game" target="_blank">three people on the internet have the same dumb opinion</a> you can write a news article on it. The catalyst was <a href="https://twitter.com/theshirarose/status/1583500955818942470" target="_blank">this specimen from Twitter</a>, who obtained 42,000 likes for saying "Taylor Swift’s music video, where she looks down at the scale where it says “fat,” is a shitty way to describe her body image struggles. Fat people don’t need to have it reiterated yet again that it’s everyone’s worst nightmare to look like us."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="54082" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32000748&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Examples <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@staceyg0817/video/7157048382681484590" target="_blank">number two</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@reynacohan/video/7157033871983398186" target="_blank">number three</a> come from other randos on TikTok, crying "Being fat is not a bad thing. And in 5 seconds of your music video, you have successfully reinforced the idea that it is.” </p><p><a href="https://www.insider.com/taylor-swift-fatphobic-antihero-music-video-scale-tiktok-twitter-2022-10" target="_blank">Insider took things a step further</a>. Instead of leaving it with three idiots having the same dumb opinion, they quoted an "expert."</p><blockquote>Taylor saying that her worst nightmares or intrusive thoughts is the scale saying she is fat is incredibly damaging to actual fat people. She's saying, 'I feel terrible when my body feels the way your body is.' The message she is sending, especially to her young fans in larger bodies, is so so hurtful.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="707ac" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32000756&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>It's not the first time Taylor has been accused of body shaming. In 2016, Demi Lovato <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/demi-lovoto-attacks-bodyshaming-taylor-swift-bodyshaming" target="_blank">accused Swift of the dastardly act... by bodyshaming HER</a>. I feel dumber for having written that sentence. Almost as dumb as I felt writing the post six years ago.</p><p>"Anti-Hero" is about Taylor dealing with her insecurities. One of them is having the constant worry about how she has to look at all times in fear of haters lashing out. Haters lashed out anyway. So to the fat-rights activists crying over five seconds in a music video, I say:<em> It's you. Hi. You're the problem. It's you.</em></p><p><p>

## Watch: Stacey Abrams busted giving in photo op, tells certain people to socially distance for 'social media'

We're like two and a half years after fifteen days to flatten the curve. No one should still be doing this. But if anyone is still doing it, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/stacey-abrams-more-photos" target="_blank">I'm not surprised it's Stacey Abrams</a>. Who is currently over seven points being Brian Kemp in her "reelection" for Georgia Governor.</p><p>Washington DC-based marketing firm "RNC Research" obtained this secret video. Abrams was addressing a room full of maskless people all on top of one another and breathing in their germs. She then directed people how to leave the building and who had to socially distance themselves to take their picture with her. Why? Because SOCIAL MEDIA! That's why!</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Stacey Abrams while in a crowded room maskless: “if you're over 18 you gotta socially distance [outside] FOR SOCIAL MEDIA” <a href="https://t.co/cEfFeF7laI">pic.twitter.com/cEfFeF7laI</a><br />— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) <a href="https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1585655508727435266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>It draws comparisons to a February incident. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/stacey-abrams-school-photo" target="_blank">Schoolchildren had to mask up for a photo</a>, while Abrams's smiled with her maskless face. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">This is maddening. <a href="https://t.co/czzI359yhM">pic.twitter.com/czzI359yhM</a><br />— Rory Cooper (@rorycooper) <a href="https://twitter.com/rorycooper/status/1490335406017200131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>No doubt the "independent" "fact" checkers are being dispatched as we speak to circle the wagons around the soon-to-be two-time failed gubernatorial candidate. It will take her hype team in the media until tomorrow morning. NBC News set the bar in February by <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/stacey-abrams-nbc-news" target="_blank">comparing Stacey and the masked kids to 9/11</a>. So Abrams' media stans have their work cut out for them.</p><p>Two and a half years later and some people still refuse to give up the theatre. It's almost admirable.</p><p><p>

## 'Rogue employee' hacks New York Post's Twitter... and Kathy Hochul had a statement ready to go politicizing it?

And almost instantaneously, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kathy-hochul-rangers-game" target="_blank">New York Governor Kathy Hochul</a> had a statement to go to politicize it.</p><p>It seems odd that a Governor  -- albeit one who is currently <a href="https://hotair.com/jazz-shaw/2022/10/27/wheres-kathy-ny-governor-disappears-after-debate-with-gop-challenger-n506108" target="_blank">nowhere to be found</a> after a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kathy-hochul-locking-up-criminals" target="_blank">disastrous debate performance</a> -- would blame the victim. But her office put out this statement: "The New York Post has long fostered an ugly, toxic conversation on their front pages and social accounts, but these posts are more vile and disgusting than usual. The New York Post needs to immediately explain how this how this reprehensible content was made public. While the New York Post has made its preference clear in the New York Governor's race, there is no room for this violent, sexist rhetoric in our politics, We demand answers."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Our response to the NY Post this AM: <a href="https://t.co/ALvvON79Je">pic.twitter.com/ALvvON79Je</a><br />— Jen Goodman (@jengoodman75) <a href="https://twitter.com/jengoodman75/status/1585639490520895489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Here are some of the now-deleted posts in question.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>We now have answers. The New York Post said in <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/news/new-york-post-website-and-twitter-hacked-flooded-with-grim-messages-including-call-for-aoc-assassination/" target="_blank">a statement to Mediaite</a>: “The New York Post’s investigation indicates that the unauthorized conduct was committed by an employee, and the employee has been terminated. This morning, we immediately removed the vile and reprehensible content from our website and social media accounts.”</p><p>It seems odd for a governor to politicize an incident such at this. We here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website would never rush to politicization as Kathy Hochul would. But since she started it...</p><p>A rogue employee, presumably who lives in New York City (Hochul's main base of support) posts fowl things on the Post's Twitter account and website. And right away, Kathy Hochul has a statement ready to go victim-blaming the New York post in a way that would rally and fire up her far-left supporters. AND it all happens at a time when Hochul needs a distraction from her governor's race being rated a TOSS UP.</p><p>It makes you think...</p><p><p>

Because there is nothing more important than family. We saw that this week when a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/coal-miner-basketball-game-son" target="_blank">coal miner went viral taking his son to a basketball game</a>. We're also seeing it with this latest viral sensation: a young king following his mother throughout the house with his trombone and soundtracking her life.</p><p>It's already over 150k likes on Twitter. That doesn't factor in everyone downloading the video from this account and tweeting it out on their own.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">This guy soundtracking his mum's life with his trombone is a wonderful thing <a href="https://t.co/TnSV9hPyAX">pic.twitter.com/TnSV9hPyAX</a><br />— Giles Paley-Phillips (@eliistender10) <a href="https://twitter.com/eliistender10/status/1416830861744427016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2021</a></blockquote> </div><p>I think I know where he got his inspiration from.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

<p>But as someone who has been biting off of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/family-guy-stewie-period" target="_blank">Family Guy</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/south-park-tackles-transgenders-competing-in-womens-sports-video" target="_blank">South Park</a>, and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/simpsons-destroys-woke-college" target="_blank">The Simpsons</a> for decades, I won't hold it against him.</p><p>I'm also an unapologetic mama's boy, which is why I found this video so touching. The mother was in on the playful joke and was laughing along with her son. This is their relationship. And speaking from experience, this young king may not realize this now, but the simple gag he's using for internet content is setting the foundation for one of the most important relationships that's going to last him for decades to come.</p><p>Just don't be surprised when his mom transitions into a grandmother and gets revenge. Mothers are patient like that.</p><p><p>

## Watch this 'day in the life' vlog of a Twitter employee and you won't feel bad Elon is firing 75% of them

It's true. It's damn true. The deal is done. This isn't one of those things where we think it's done. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-nyt-chaos-agent" target="_blank">He showed up yesterday with a sink and everything</a>.  The first order of business may be to fire 75% of the current workforce. As you can imagine, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-twitter-open-letter" target="_blank">the workforce is unhappy with this news</a>. Ironic, because it's the same workforce who threatened to walk out if Musk became their boss. Now that he'll open the door for them, they are boo boo faced about that too. There is no pleasing some people.</p><p>To get a sense of a typical day of working for the bird app, citizen journalist Libs of TikTok shared this vlog of a Twitter employee. I believe this is the San Francisco HQ. The same HQ where the employees were pissed Elon would make them go back to work at, instead of allowing them to work from home in their underpants. Then they got pissed when he said <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-twitter-polls" target="_blank">he would turn it into a  homeless shelter</a> -- decades of progressive leadership has turned San Fran into the homeless capital of California, which is the homeless capital of America -- since it was an empty building.</p><p>When you hear about Twitter employees being wished well on their future endeavors, here's an example of their "work" day.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">This is “a day in the life of a Twitter employee.” No wonder <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@elonmusk</a> is firing 75% of them <a href="https://t.co/cAHOuni765">pic.twitter.com/cAHOuni765</a><br />— Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) <a href="https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1585395267552960512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>If it were me, I would be pissed that Twitter didn't have an on-site barista to pour my coffee for me. You can't expect me to make my OWN coffee like a low-class Meta employee. </p><p>The rest of the day was filled with a meeting, foosball, meditation, and a few rounds of cornhole. Though there wasn't time for yoga. Yet. Missing from this typical "day of the life" was anything that resembles actual work. Unless the video of her spending twenty minutes pushing the button that throttles opposing viewpoints was left on the cutting room floor.</p><p>As Chef Gruel puts it:<em> "This is camp for adults complete with steam table cuisine and hemp farts."</em></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">This is camp for adults complete with steam table cuisine and hemp farts.<br />— Chef Andrew Gruel (@ChefGruel) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChefGruel/status/1585397267623989248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>This tweet has nothing to do with the video, but I'm a sucker for a good "your mom" joke.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Your mom should be democratically owned by everyone<br />— Mango (@Mango68207471) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mango68207471/status/1585342499715158016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>If Elon has his druthers, 75% of current Twitter employees may find themselves needing to look for a job they will be expected to do work at if they wish to receive a paycheck.

## Matthew Perry apologizes for accidentally wishing death on Keanu Reeves: 'My Mistake'

In an excerpt that has been blowing up the internet, he appeared to have a sad that fellow actor Keanu Reeves wasn't dead yet. In a follow-up statement, Perry says that was a whoopsie. Nothing personal against Keanu.</p><p>In the upcoming book <em>"Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing,"</em> Perry had this to say:</p><blockquote>Why is it that the original thinkers like River Phoenix and Heath Ledger die, but Keanu Reeves still walks among us?</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>I'm a child of the 80s who was a film nerd in the 90s, and for the life of me couldn't tell you anything River Phoenix did other than overdose outside of The Viper Room. And while his Joker was okay and <em>10 Things I Hate About You</em> is underrated, I think the Health Ledger adoration is a bit much.</p><p>But to feel bad that they're gone and Keanu Reeves still walks among us? Let's be clear, this is the guy Perry wishes (or wished) dead:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Happy Birthday Keanu Reeves.<br />I could've posted any amount of movie clips of Keanu being heroic in any number of films. But here he is riding on the subway and giving up his seat for a pregnant lady.

Some fans joke he tries to avoid becoming a part of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MeToo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MeToo</a> movement and others praise him for respecting personal space.

Keanu Reeves was an actor chosen at random. And the book went through every stage of editing without someone saying "really, dude?"</p><blockquote>I'm actually a big fan of Keanu. I just chose a random name, my mistake. I apologize. I should have used my own name instead</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Because Keanu Reeves is the best among us, I'm sure he accepts your apology. After all, he's <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/man-attacked-armed-robbers" target="_blank">John Wick</a> and you're <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/friends-reunion-china-censor" target="_blank">Chandler Bing</a>. If anything, he takes pity on you.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Joe Biden believes black people don't know how to choose extra legroom on a plane or even afford it

But give our dude credit. He's not going down without a fight. Biden's out there talking about... services fees and legroom.

They say we are supposed to find common ground? If Biden announced he was seizing the means of production of Ticketmaster, he would have my support. It's obscene. I tried to get Blink 182 tickets and had no idea what the original ticket prices even were. We all should have listened to Pearl Jam about Ticketmaster in the 90s. But we didn't.

</p>
<p>We've seen this from Joe Biden before. He takes a simple thing and projects onto the rest of us that it's too confusing for us to figure out on our own. Like most white liberals, he finds <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-systemic" target="_blank">black people of color less capable of all</a>. This is the same guy who implied the POCs can't figure out how to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-vaccine-minorities" target="_blank">use the internet</a> or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-black-entrepreneurs" target="_blank">hire a lawyer</a> without his mayonnaise-looking ass helping them.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Tell me the last thing you did...and add "people of color hardest hit." That seems to be the Democrat strategy these days...just tack on "people of color" to any old statement. <br />I just made a sandwich. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PeopleOfColorHardestHit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PeopleOfColorHardestHit</a> <a href="https://t.co/hOiNV8hh3u">https://t.co/hOiNV8hh3u</a><br />— Kira (@RealKiraDavis) <a href="https://twitter.com/RealKiraDavis/status/1585347914020188160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>This guy knows what I'm talking about.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>And she's thinking about how all she wants is to be able to afford groceries. Also, while the president might not feel it coming out, he has to at least smell it.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="1dc10" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32008290&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Joe Biden and the people who control Joe Biden do not think Americans can perform basic tasks without the government helping us. They NEVER thought minorities were able to live their lives with Democrats telling them how. It's why so many voters of color are leaving the party and looking for the nearest Republican to elect.</p><p><p>
