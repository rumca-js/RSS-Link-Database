<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Over the past few years we&rsquo;ve tested loads of VPN services, checking for performance, privacy policies, and extra features. We&rsquo;ve done most of this work for the PC, and you can find our absolute favorite <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html">best VPN picks here</a>. But we&rsquo;re also testing the Android apps to see which service reigns supreme on Google&rsquo;s OS. While some services are champs on any platform, others particularly shine on Android devices and we&rsquo;re here with a curated list to help you choose.</p>



<p>We consider several criteria when determining the best VPNs for Android. First, it has to be a top performer on the OS. Also, we understand that Wi-Fi can be inconsistent at times, therefore we test these apps over three days, running a total of 15 tests each day (three times for each test country location). Then we considered the Android app itself and whether it was easy to manage, as well as other things such as pricing and the number of simultaneous devices allowed per account. We provide links to the stand-alone app in the Google Play store as well as links to our reviews of the full desktop program&mdash;in case you want a complete AV solution for all your devices.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here are our recommendations for the best VPNs for Android.</p>

<p>Speedify&rsquo;s claim to fame is that it harnesses all your active connections to make one super-zippy VPN connection, and the effect was undeniable during our tests. Speedify maintained a jaw-dropping 83.56 percent of the base speed. These speeds only happened when the phone had Wi-Fi and cellular connections available. One other nice thing about Speedify is that the switch from Wi-Fi to mobile network is near seamless. So if you&rsquo;re streaming a song and step outside of your wireless network&rsquo;s range, the connection will switch to mobile without missing a beat.</p>

<p>Speedify&rsquo;s app design is not the simplest or most straightforward design, but it&rsquo;s easy enough. It also maintains some statistics such as how many seamless failovers you&rsquo;ve had with your device, how much data&rsquo;s been transferred, and your top download and upload speeds. It would be better if you could pick your country location before connecting, as opposed to the current setup: connecting, choosing a new country location, and then reconnecting. Still, it&rsquo;s a minor quibble for an excellent mobile VPN.</p>

<p>NordVPN is easily one of the most popular services around. The company offers 59 country locations with 5,500 servers. It also promises that its service will work with Netflix. It doesn&rsquo;t offer dedicated servers for this. Instead, Netflix is just supposed to work no matter which server you&rsquo;re on, and it does in our tests.</p>

<p>NordVPN&rsquo;s Android app is similar to the desktop app in that it has the same style of map that you can use to select a location. The rest of the app is very mobile friendly with a movable carousel of popular locations, and a full country list underneath. The Android app also supports Nord&rsquo;s specialty servers for P2P file sharing, TOR over VPN, and double-hop VPNs. NordVPN also offers malware protection that is activated by default. </p>

<p>NordVPN&rsquo;s privacy policy says it doesn&rsquo;t log any of your activity and&nbsp;charges $59.88 per year, or you can get two years for $99.48&mdash;those are both new customer prices. After the initial period, the single year price goes up to $99.48 and the two-year price is $198.96. It&rsquo;s a higher-priced VPN, but it&rsquo;s also feature filled, and fast. In our tests, Nord maintained nearly 67 percent of the base speed.</p>

<p>Another good choice for newcomers is CyberGhost from Kape Technologies. This VPN has a similar-ish design to ExpressVPN (below). It has a simple on/off button at the top of the app, and underneath that is the tile where you can pick the country location. Tapping on the country location option takes you to a list where you can choose a connection based on the country, or you can choose a streaming location, or choose from your own favorites list. In our tests, CyberGhost maintained close to 61 percent of the base speed.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s about all there is to this app, which makes it an excellent option for first timers. For the full program CyberGhost charges $51.48 for a single year, or you can get two years for $78, or three for $89.31.</p>

<p>ExpressVPN has always been very easy to use and is another Kape-owned VPN. Combine ease of use with its excellent speeds, and Express is a great choice for rookies. In our tests, ExpressVPN maintained 72.14 percent of the base speed, which is excellent and earned it a second place finish behind Speedify. Switching locations is as easy as tapping on the tile underneath the on/off button at the top. When the VPN is not active the app background is red, and when the VPN is connected the background turns green.</p>

<p>ExpressVPN for Android also supports split tunneling, auto-connect, and a kill switch to help maintain privacy should the VPN connection drop. </p>

<p>This VPN is more complicated than CyberGhost, which is why it&rsquo;s our second choice for rookies, or those looking for something a little more advanced but still decidedly in newbie territory. Express VPN costs about $100 for the first 15 months for the multi-device subscription. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise to see Mullvad as our top choice for privacy. It&rsquo;s simply unbeatable when it comes to staying as anonymous and private online as possible while using a VPN. Unlike most other services, Mullvad doesn&rsquo;t even ask for your email address. Instead, it generates a random account number and then you use that to log in and pay for the service. The service will also accept cash, as well as Bitcoin, PayPal, and credit card giving you an even wider number of options to stay as anonymous as possible.</p>

<p>Mullvad promises it won&rsquo;t track your browsing habits (as all the services in this roundup do), and it has good speeds. In our tests, Mullvad for Android maintained around 57 percent of the base speed. That&rsquo;s not as good as some of the other services, but it&rsquo;s definitely good enough for most uses. Mullvad charges &euro;5 per month, which at this writing was a little over $5.</p>

<p>If Mullvad isn&rsquo;t your speed then another solid choice for privacy is ProtonVPN. This service is just one part of a larger suite of services that includes ProtonMail, ProtonCalendar, and ProtonDrive. You don&rsquo;t have to subscribe to everything as ProtonVPN is available as a standalone service, though you can get a deal with ProtonMail if you like. In our tests, ProtonVPN maintained around 56 percent of the base speed. It has a wide number of country choices, its privacy policy makes all the right promises, and it supports Netflix streaming, TOR over VPN, and P2P on specific servers. It also has a security feature called Secure Core that you can read about on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://protonvpn.com/support/secure-core-vpn/&amp;xcust=2-1-403351-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">the company&rsquo;s site</a>. ProtonVPN charges $71.88 for the first year.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested </h2>



<p>We use the same approach on Android as we do on Windows. We picked five country locations and tested each location three times on three separate days. Then we took the average global performance of the VPN as an average, and then compared that to the average base speed. Then we represented the difference as a percentage. The reason we do that as opposed to showing actual megabytes-per-second scores is that those numbers can change based on so many factors such as your ISP, equipment, and time of day. What we really need to know is how much speed we lose when connected to the VPN (it&rsquo;s always a loss). That is an experience that is more likely to translate across various setups as opposed to specific speeds.</p>



<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-vpn">What to look for in a VPN</h2>



<p>To get the most out of a VPN you need to consider a few factors. First, you want something that respects your privacy and logs as much information as you&rsquo;re comfortable with. If that means no data at all then something like Mullvad or ProtonVPN is best for you. If you don&rsquo;t mind a little logging and your primary concern is speed or Netflix support then there are many VPNs that will suit that purpose. Speed is also a concern since you want to make sure the service can support whatever it is you want to do, be it streaming video, gaming, or just browsing the web. Going with a known quantity is also critical since VPNs are handling such important, and personal, data you need to know who&rsquo;s behind the company and what their reputation is&mdash;reading reviews will help with that. Finally, after all that, consider pricing and what best suits your budget. Keep those tips in mind and you&rsquo;re likely to find an excellent VPN service that&rsquo;s right for you.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s it for our roundup of the top five Android VPNs.

<h3 id="what-is-a-vpn">What is a VPN?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>A VPN, otherwise known as a <em>virtual private network</em>, disguises your identity and encrypts your internet traffic while browsing. In addition, you can connect to VPN servers all across the world. So if you want to access location restricted content like streaming services, you can connect to the appropriate country&rsquo;s server and gain access to that country&rsquo;s specific content.</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<h3 id="how-does-a-vpn-work">How does a VPN work?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>A VPN effectively hides your IP address by redirecting it through a remote server hosted by the VPN company. If anyone is watching, the VPN server then appears to be the source of your data instead of yourself. These remote servers can be located both in your own country as well as in different countries around the world. Additionally, your network traffic from your computer to the VPN is encrypted adding an extra layer of privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are connected to a VPN while browsing the internet, the VPN will act as a kind of middleman between your computer and a website. When your computer sends a request to the VPN, it then passes it along to a website. The website in return, sends its response back to the VPN, which forwards it via a secure connection all the way to your computer.</p>

<h3 id="are-vpns-legal-to-use">Are VPNs legal to use?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes! In the United States as well as most countries, using a VPN is legal. You may find that certain websites try to block VPN connections, but they are still okay to use. You should know though, while using a VPN is legal, some of the activities done <em>while using</em> a VPN might be illegal. Activities such as downloading pirated copyrighted content or accessing dark web markets are both illegal with and without a VPN.</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Free PDF editors might not have all of the bells and whistles of a full-featured editor like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407201/adobe-acrobat-pro-dc-review.html">Adobe&rsquo;s Acrobat Pro DC</a>, but they do offer a few advantages over their paid partners. First and foremost, you don&rsquo;t have to pay to use them. If you don&rsquo;t regularly work with PDF files, a premium paid editor probably isn&rsquo;t worth the investment and a free editor can get the job done just fine. Also, because free PDF editors are typically browser based, there are no platform- or device-compatibility issues you have to worry about.</p>

<p>Of course, you shouldn&rsquo;t expect a free product to have all the features of a paid one. But most free editors will allow you to edit PDF files by adding and modifying text and images and shapes, drawing freehand, and note writing. Free editors will also let you create new PDFs and convert PDFs to other file formats as well.</p>



<p>If you find that you need more advanced features such as password protection, bates numbering, or e-signatures, then you&rsquo;re probably better served by one of the desktop editors in our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407214/best-pdf-editors.html">best paid PDF editors buying guide</a>.</p>

<p>PDF Candy is the rare free PDF editor that offers a lot of the features you&rsquo;d typically have to pay for. We&rsquo;re talking scanning, multiple file-conversion options, and OCR functionality. While the free version has access to the expansive toolset of the paid version, you&rsquo;re limited to one PDF task per hour. For unfettered access, you need to shell out $6 month.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-free-pdf-editor">What to look for in a free PDF editor</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Content editing: </strong>As its name indicates, a PDF editor&rsquo;s primary function is to enable you to edit a document. That includes the ability to add and modify text; insert, resize, and move images; and reorganize pages in the PDF. Most free PDF editors will let you perform these tasks, though they may impose daily limits on how many you can perform or how many documents you can edit.</li><li><strong>Create, convert, and export PDFs</strong>: A common need for a PDF editor is to create PDF files from scanned hard copies or by converting digital documents. A good free PDF editor will be able to convert common file formats such as Word, JPG, and HTML to a PDF and preserve the original formatting. It should also be able to export PDFs into other editable formats such as Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, HTML, or plain text, maintaining the original files hyperlinks, images, and other elements.</li><li><strong>Review and annotate: </strong>Most free PDF editors allow you to add comments and other annotations to PDF files during review. Typical annotation tools include sticky notes, shapes, and drawing markup options. </li><li><strong>Signatures</strong>: Often all you need a PDF editor for is to sign a document. This used to be a premium feature only available on paid desktop editors, but more free PDF editors are allowing users to create and add electronic signatures to documents.</li></ul><div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-block faq-block"><h2 class="faq-block-title" id="faq"> FAQ </h2><hr class="block-horizotal-divider" /><div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block"><div class="faq-save-content"><span class="faq-rank">1.</span>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>While there are a number of different types of PDF file formats, they all fall under the umbrella term of PDF documents. A PDF form is a type of PDF document that has editable form fields a user can fill out. Typically, parts of the document are static and can&rsquo;t be changed in a PDF form. These usually include questions and instructions for those who end up filling out the form later on. In a PDF form, the content fields a user fills out are typically open to editing and can offer a list of possible answer options or can be written in freely.</p>

<h3 id="are-word-files-and-pdf-documents-different">Are Word files and PDF documents different?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes. They are two entirely different document formats. While you can export from one file format to another, they are not the same. Word file formats are usually used for word processing, editing, and making changes to text. PDF documents on the other hand, are most often utilized for viewing, sharing, and printing documents. Additionally, Word files can be read and/or  written to and contain some version of the &ldquo;.doc&rdquo; file format. Whereas PDF files are typically read-only and contain the &ldquo;.pdf&rdquo; file format. </p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes. If you have a PDF document that you do not want anyone else to be able to edit, you can protect the file. You can do this by opening the file in Acrobat, clicking <em>Tools &gt; Protect</em>. Then you have a few options as to whether you want to just restrict editing with a password, or if you want to encrypt the file for further safety. Once you choose how you want to protect the PDF document, you can set a password and save.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes, many free PDF editors such as our top pick PDF Candy, allow you to merge two or more PDFs into one. As most free PDF editors are browser-based, you will just need to open up the PDF editor application or website in your browser and click the &ldquo;Merge&rdquo; option. It will then ask you to add the files of all PDFs you wish to merge. Once the files have been added, just make sure that they are in the correct position and alignment you want before proceeding with the merge. Afterwards, all of your previously PDF files will be merged together into one new PDF document. </p>

## The best USB-C cables for charging and transferring data

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>It&rsquo;s easy to think that all USB-C cables are the same, and that differences are just promotional gimmicks and a way to hike up prices. After all, it&rsquo;s <em>just a cable</em>, right?</p>



<p>Despite this being a common belief, it&rsquo;s actually wrong. We have tested numerous USB-C cables and we can say with certainty they are <em>not</em> all the same. In fact, we noticed huge performance differences among cables both in regards to charging devices and transferring data.</p>



<p>But with such a multitude of options available, how are you supposed to know which are the best USB-C cables? To figure this out, we tested 14 cables ranging from the biggest, most-recognizable brand-names to the cheapest of the cheap and put them through the wringer to test how they all stood up against one another. We identified some clear winners, which we have highlighted below to help make your purchasing decision easier.</p>



<p>We separated our picks into two groups: USB-C cables suitable for charging, and those suitable for both charging <em>and</em>&nbsp;fast data transfer. The distinction essentially comes down to the difference between USB-C 2.0 and 3.1. (Learn more in our guide on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3622451/how-to-buy-a-usb-c-cable-on-amazon.html">how to buy a USB-C cable on Amazon without losing your mind</a>, and find out about how we tested these cables below our picks.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Javex USB-C to USB-C cable came to our attention over its claim of having met the stringent UL 9990 testing standards, which involves Underwriters Laboratory buying random samples of the cable from stores and rigorously testing them for performance and consistency.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, it&rsquo;s probably not cheap to be in the program, especially when few are even aware of the value of a UL 9990 logo; which could explain why Javex is no longer listed as part of the program but still claims UL9990 &ldquo;materials&rdquo; are used.</p>

<p>Regardless, we do know that in our testing, the cable was top-notch in delivering higher voltage at both 60-watt and 100-watt loads. Like most brands we&rsquo;ve never heard of, there&rsquo;s confusing ad copy, with claims of just 5 volts at 3 amps (15 watts) and no mention of it supporting 20 volts at 5 amps (the 100 watts you need for a laptop). The ad copy also mentions a 56k ohm pull-up resistor &ldquo;for safety.&rdquo; That last part confuses us because that&rsquo;s only required on a USB-C to USB-A cable&mdash;not USB-C to USB-C.</p>

<p>Despite this, we saw solid performance in both reaching 100-watt charge rates for a laptop, and very low resistance on its high-quality wires makes it our top pick for a 6-foot charging cable from a brand you haven&rsquo;t heard of.</p>

<p>And while it lacks wires to support USB 3.1 speeds, that makes the cable very pliable and lightweight. </p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be honest, we didn&rsquo;t know what to expect of the stock 6.6-foot Apple USB-C Charge Cable Apple includes with its MacBook laptops and sells as a replacement item. Yes, we&rsquo;ve heard the stories and seen the pictures of the sleeving on many Apple cables that fall off if you look at them too hard.</p>

<p>In the end, Apple&rsquo;s USB-C Charge Cable won us over and is actually our recommended cable for those who want a big name on the box and intend to use it for mostly charging. When we say the box, we mean it, because Apple oddly doesn&rsquo;t include any branding on the cable itself, which is a mistake because you just might mix it up with a lousy cable.</p>

<p>In the end though, it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s inside a cable that matters the most and the Apple USB-C cable has top-notch wiring materials that can deliver the most power to your laptop, phone, or tablet. Want to charge your laptop at 100 watts all day? That shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem for the Apple USB-C Charge Cable.</p>

<p>Obviously, as a charge cable it&rsquo;s terrible for data transfer and can&rsquo;t drive Thunderbolt devices nor your monitor, but as a charging cable it&rsquo;s excellent.</p>

<p>Another ding is its price of $19, but if you want a name-brand cable, it&rsquo;s hard to beat this. Plus you can buy it from an Apple store or retailer so you know you&rsquo;re actually getting what you paid for and not some counterfeit.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a high-quality USB-C cable that will give you excellent performance, it&rsquo;s hard to beat Cable Matters 6-foot USB-C cable. The cable can do it all and do it all well (well, almost) from charging at up to 100 watts, transferring data from your USB 3.1 SSD, or running a monitor. The only area where it doesn&rsquo;t excel is in Thunderbolt performance, which is limited to 20Gbps. That&rsquo;s not a ding in our book because that&rsquo;s the tradeoff of a 6-foot cable. To hit 40Gbps, you&rsquo;d have to step down to a shorter cable.</p>

<p>The other cost of this quality is weight and pliability. The cable weighs almost 3.5 ounces, making it the the heaviest cable we tested outside of the 4-meter (13-foot) cable we looked at above. Those thicker gauge wires also mean you can&rsquo;t roll up as easily or compactly as other cables, too.</p>

<p>And no surprise, high performance and high quality mean it&rsquo;s not cheap. At $18, it&rsquo;s among the more expensive cables here. But if performance and quality is your jam, the Cable Matters 6-foot USB-C cable will have you humming.</p>

<p>Cable Matters USB3 Cable is but 2.6-foot so it lacks the appeal of long cables. What appealed to us enough to buy the cable is its USB4 rating which promises high-performance.</p>

<p>And no surprise, the cable was able to charge our laptop at 100 watts, and offered the best voltage and lowest resistance thanks to the wires Cable Matters uses and its 2.6-foot length. That also translated into excellent USB 3.1 data transfer rates, monitor support and the only cable here capable of driving our Thunderbolt 3 SSD at a full 40Gbps data rates.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for high-performance in all things and don&rsquo;t mind the length, the Cable Matters USB4 cable is our pick.</p>

<p>Its weaknesses are its stiff feel thanks to the higher-quality, thicker wires and construction Cable Matters uses, and its price. Looked at in dollars-per-foot, this $20 cable is about $8 per foot. With the Amazon Basics USB 3.1 USB-C cable below, you&rsquo;re only paying $3.17 per foot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That Amazon cable can&rsquo;t match the Cable Matters USB4 in Thunderbolt performance, but few need it. That makes the cable best suited to niche areas but it&rsquo;s fast nonetheless with excellent construction.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to like about the Amazon Basics USB 3.1 Gen 1 USB-C cable. This 6-foot cable features rubber sleeving and hefty wires that give it a substantive feel without the stiffness you get from some cables.</p>

<p>Its Amazon Basics logo helps prevent you from mixing up this cable with the generic cables you have laying around, and the SuperSpeed logo assures you it&rsquo;s fast for data transfers.</p>

<p>In our testing, we were able to able to push the limits of our USB 3.2 10Gbps&nbsp; SSD and could also drive our 240Hz 1080p panel. It also was capable of driving our high-performance Thunderbolt 3 drive at its 20Gbps data rate but not at its 40Gbps data rate&mdash;which is expected of a 6-foot cable. And despite its USB 5Gbps rating, we could hit 10Gbps speeds anyway which says the cable&rsquo;s signal integrity is good despite its length. Why not label it USB 10Gbps? Amazon is sticking to the rules which say a 10Gbps isn&rsquo;t supposed to work on a 6 foot cable.</p>

<p>Also oddly, Amazon specifically claims there&rsquo;s &ldquo;no alt-mode&rdquo; support for this cable so driving a monitor won&rsquo;t work. Except it does just fine since the alt-mode on USB-C just uses the wires included for the higher-speed USB 3.1 data transfers to run the monitor. We could even drive our high-performance Thunderbolt drive at 20Gbps transfer rates so way to sell yourself short Amazon.</p>

<p>The only real disappointment with the cable is charging is limited to 3 amps which means it tops out at 60-watt charge rates. That&rsquo;s fine for a Dell XPS 13 or MacBook Pro 13, but not enough for a Dell XPS 15 or MacBook Pro 16. In fact, that&rsquo;s the primary reason we didn&rsquo;t give the cable the nod for best brand-name cable pick.</p>

<p>It does carry Amazon&rsquo;s name which has value to some, but at $19, it&rsquo;s hardly a steal. With that said, this is a fine cable, but there are indeed ones with more capability too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Compared to our picks above, we wouldn&rsquo;t advise purchasing any of the other USB-C cables we tested. Why settle for something inferior? But we understand some will want to see which cables didn&rsquo;t make the cut and why.</p>

<p>The Dockcase USB-C to USB-C cable is the worst value here if you only judge a cable by length and price. In capability though, this 8.5-inch cable is one of the better performers&mdash;a consequence of its short length. The shorter the cable, the less the resistance and, well, the better the performance, even with thin wires.</p>

<p>The Dockcase advertises a 100-watt charge rate, 4K video support, and even Thunderbolt 3 support. The company doesn&rsquo;t mention it but that Thunderbolt 3 speed is limited to 20Gbps, not the full 40Gbps Thunderbolt 3 users expect, so take note. It&rsquo;s not practical, but we did charge our laptop at 100 watts with the Dockcase.</p>

<p>Physically, the cable is a flat design with a rubbery outer sheath. The strain relief where the cable connects to the housing is minimal, as well, which makes us question its durability over time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its length is best suited for an ultra-fast portable USB-C SSD, and can pinch hit for charging or running your monitor. We personally wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it for use with a high-speed Thunderbolt drive or device though, given its aforementioned limitations with that spec.</p>

<p>The Amazon Basics USB-C to USB-C USB 2.0 is the cable that epitomizes minimum effort. At 6-feet long, it will do its job to charge your phone or tablet, and even your laptop at up to 60 watts, and that&rsquo;s about it. Since it&rsquo;s a USB 2.0 cable, data transfers to or from your computer will be dog slow compared to a USB 3.1 cable. Moving a 1GB file might take a few seconds on a USB 3.1 cable and nearly a minute with the Amazon Basics USB-C Charging cable.</p>

<p>The cable itself is amazingly light. In fact, it&rsquo;s probably too light, which means Amazon didn&rsquo;t really use the thickest wires it could for this cable. That shows up with some of the highest resistance among the cables 6 feet or longer in this roundup, meaning less power delivered to your phone or tablet. Granted, we are talking about 2 percent lower wattage compared to the best of the longer cables here. But still, that&rsquo;s like a school report card that says &ldquo;present&rdquo; as its main selling point.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not all bad for the Amazon Basics cable. It does carry a big-name brand. And its lack of wires to support higher-speed USB 3.1 makes it relatively thin and light, and very pliable.</p>

<p>Would we use this cable to charge our laptop every day? Probably not, but for someone charging a phone or tablet, its lightweight feel can be be a plus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while it&rsquo;s a decent cable for certain uses, its pricing hurts it. At its typical pricing of $12 it&rsquo;s not worth it.

<p>Among the small-brand cables that support all the features of a USB-C to USB-C cable, the Rampow ranked as probably the best. The 6.6-foot cable supports USB 3.1 10Gbps data transfer rates, up to 100-watt charge rates, and could run our high-refresh USB-C monitor. Although its USB drive performance was a few points off the faster cables here, it could run our high-performance Thunderbolt drive at 20Gbps just fine.</p>

<p>Are there better cables? Sure, obviously, for a charge-only cable we&rsquo;d take the Javex over the Rampow, and the Cable Matters 6-foot USB-C cable is a better full-feature cable, as well.</p>

<p>But we know, you just like the way it looks. The fact that it&rsquo;s not expensive at $14 doesn&rsquo;t hurt either. For a small-brand cable, it&rsquo;s not too bad and you could do worse.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-test-usb-c-cables">How we test USB-C cables</h2>



<p>For this roundup, we purchased retail USB-C cables for our testing.&nbsp;We physically measured and weighed each cable and examined each connector. A proper USB-C cable should use a one-piece shell rather than a folded shell with a visible seam in it. None of the cables we purchased used the lower-strength folded shells.</p>



<p>We do want to point out that weight does tend to matter. All cables are essentially tiny metallic wire strands bound together with insulation. Sure, the connector, housing,&nbsp; braiding, and outer shell all factors in its weight, but lighter-duty cables literally have fewer wires and are far lighter. For example, the Cable Matters high-performance USB 4 cable is 32-inches long and weighs more than the Amazon Basics low-performance USB 2.0 cable, which is more than twice as long.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s not always better though, as a cable with more wires that are a heavier gauge&mdash;or thicker&mdash;are less pliable and also take up more space in your bag.</p>



<h3 id="are-they-all-wired-correctly">Are they all wired correctly?</h3>



<p>You&rsquo;d think you could tell whether a cable is USB-C 2.0 cable by looking at the wires in the connector but that&rsquo;s not the case. Some cables use connectors with pins that aren&rsquo;t hooked up to anything.</p>



<p>To check each cable, we&nbsp;use a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tindie.com/products/BitTradeOne/usb-cable-checker-2-assembled/&amp;xcust=2-1-395115-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BitTradeOne USB Cable Checker 2.0</a> to first see what actual wires are inside of the cable and whether they are hooked up correctly and what they do. For example, a USB-C cable that is fine for charging but a dog in data transfer&nbsp; &nbsp;will show up as being wired only for USB-C 2.0, as you can see below by the green LEDs. The &ldquo;CC&rdquo; LED indicates the Cable Configuration channel is wired up correctly.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image large"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/usb_c_2.0-100901753-orig.jpg?auto=webp" rel="nofollow"><img alt="usb c 2.0" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/usb_c_2.0-100901753-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption><p>The basic Amazon Basics USB-C cable is wired only for USB 2.0 data rates.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>A full-featured USB-C cable has additional wires to carry higher-speed data and the USB Cable Checker 2.0 shows this Cable Matters USB 4 cable in the picture below with the correct wiring all available. The small LED display also tells us that the cable has an ID e-Marker chip, the shell is properly grounded to the cable, and it does a quick resistance test too.&nbsp;The cable tester also checks to see if the metal shell of the cable is grounded to the ground wire of the cable, which is required by spec. Every cable here was properly grounded.</p>



<h3 id="resistance-is-futile">Resistance is futile</h3>



<p>The resistance check from our cable checker is quick and dirty, so we augmented that by also measuring the resistance of the cable&rsquo;s ground wire and vbus wire using a milli-ohm meter connected via a pair of USB-C breakout boards. The breakout boards at both ends add about 30 mohms to the total. By spec, a USB-C cable should not exceed 83 mohms on the ground wires and 167 mohms on the voltage bus.</p>



<p>Many of the cables we tested were within spec or close enough that it didn&rsquo;t matter, since there&rsquo;s likely even more resistance we&rsquo;re not able to account for with our method. We definitely could tell which cables used heavier-gauge or thick wires with less resistance to restrict the flow of electricity, and which ones cheaped out.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image large"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/usb_c_4-100901755-orig.jpg?auto=webp" rel="nofollow"><img alt="usb c 4" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/usb_c_4-100901755-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption><p>This Cable Matters USB 4 cable has all the features you want for transferring data or connecting your monitor.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<h3 id="what-did-the-e-marker-say">What did the e-Marker say?</h3>



<p>Since each of the more advanced cables carries an e-Marker that tells the computer what the cable can do, we noted that and the validity of the e-Marker&rsquo;s claims. All but one of the cables met those claims, but the one that was wrong was way, way wrong. It claimed USB 3.2 10Gbps transfer speeds and a 1-meter length, when it literally didn&rsquo;t have the wires for the faster transfer speeds and was actually 2 meters long.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image large"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/emarker-100901754-orig.jpg?auto=webp" rel="nofollow"><img alt="emarker" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/emarker-100901754-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption><p>Some USB-C cables feature a chip or e-Marker that contains information the device reads. This two meter cable&rsquo;s e-Marker is incorrect.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>We then looked at how fast the cable would charge and transfer data, and whether it supported an alternate mode to run a monitor, using real-world hardware.</p>



<p>For charging speeds we recorded the maximum wattage at which the cable could charge an Asus ROG Strix 15 gaming laptop over its USB-C port using USB-Power Delivery with an Aukey 100 watt USB-PD charger as the source while the laptop was under load.&nbsp;USB-PD today is limited to 100 watts (with a 240-watt spec on the way). Any USB-C to USB-C cable should handle 3 amps&nbsp;at 20 volts, or 60 watts.&nbsp;All of the USB-C to USB-C cables fell into the standard 60-watt or 100-watt camps.</p>



<p>We didn&rsquo;t test the temperature of each cable&rsquo;s housing, but we did test the cheapest cable by running it at 5 amps and 20 volts for an hour. The housing heated up by 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and the cable itself became relatively warm (see the thermal image below). Not ideal, but it did this without failure. We subjected other cables to two-hour loads without failure, as well.</p>



<p>For one final charge test, we tasked each cable with a 20 volt, 3 amp and 20 volt 5 amp load (for the 5-amp rated cables) and measured the voltage delivered at the end of the cable using our CT-3 meter.</p>



<p>The cables with the thinnest-gauge wires add more resistance, which in turn reduces the voltage delivered to your laptop, tablet, or phone.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image large"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/thermal_usb_c-100901756-orig.jpg?auto=webp" rel="nofollow"><img alt="thermal usb c" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/thermal_usb_c-100901756-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption><p>The thinner the wires used in a cable, the greater the resistance, and the greater the heat as you can see from this thermal image of a $5 6.6-foot USB cable carrying a 5 amp, 20 volt, 100-watt load for one hour.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>For data transfer, we measured the speed using Crystal Disk Mark 8 while plugged into the USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 port of an MSI Prestige 14 Evo laptop. Since the cables can also be used to transfer data from a Thunderbolt storage drive, we measured how fast that happened using a high-speed SSD-based SanDisk Professional Thunderbolt G-Drive. We found three transfer modes among the cables tested: Thunderbolt 20Gbps performance, Thunderbolt 40Gbps performance, or zero performance because the cable would not work at all with a Thunderbolt drive.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image large"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/06/1-100893464-orig.jpg?auto=webp" rel="nofollow"><img alt="1" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/06/1-100893464-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption><p>Basic USB-C charging cables will not enable advanced drives such as this G-Drive Thunderbolt 3-based SSD, despite the USB-C plug fitting.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>Our last test looked at each cable&rsquo;s capability running an Asus ROG Strix 17.3-inch portable gaming monitor. The monitor is a high-performance gaming monitor with a resolution of 1920&times;1080 and refresh rate of 240Hz&mdash;which is basically the same bandwidth requirements of a standard 4K 60Hz display.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>There are a number of different types of USB-C cables including: USB 2.0, USB 3.1 Gen 1, USB 3.1 Gen 2, and Thunderbolt 4.</p>



<p>The main difference between all of these is their data transfer rates. Older versions such as USB 2.0 have data transfer rates of 480Mbps while the latest Thunderbolt 4 has screaming-fast data transfer rates of 40Gbps.</p>



<p>Also, Thunderbolt 4 is distinctive in the fact that it also allows for video-out DisplayPort signals, meaning you can use it to connect to an external display. All other USB-C ports do not allow for this video-out capability.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>USB-C cables are mainly used for both data transfer and charging. The speed of data transfer and relative charging power are dependent upon the version of USB-C cable and port you are connecting with.</p>



<p>If your USB-C cable is a Thunderbolt 4&mdash;marked with a lighting bolt icon on the connector&mdash;then you are also able to connect it to an external monitor to send video-out signals.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>There are a few key differences between the two. The first is the size and shape of the cable. A USB-A cable connector will be rectangular in shape with a 4-pin connector. A USB-C cable on the other hand, will be much smaller and thinner with rounded edges. </p>



<p>There are different versions of both USB-A and USB-C, which support different data transfer rates. Typically, USB-C will be faster both for data transfer and power charging.</p>

## This cute lil’ monitor attaches to the top of your laptop screen

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Portable USB-based monitors are a fantastic way to expand your productivity on the road, but they have a few issues. First of all, finding space to sprawl out your laptop setup isn&rsquo;t always easy, and second, having a second screen you need to hunch down to look at just amplifies the basic ergonomic problems of the laptop form factor. Nex is hoping to solve both of those problems with the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://nexdock.com/meet-nexpad/&amp;xcust=2-1-1363856-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NexPad</a>, a portable monitor that sits above your laptop&rsquo;s screen instead of beside it. </p>



<p>In technical terms, there&rsquo;s nothing particularly groundbreaking about the NexPad screen (spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nexpad-portable-touchscreen-perches-on-laptops/&amp;xcust=2-1-1363856-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Trends</a>). It&rsquo;s a 12-inch, 1080p touchscreen with an IPS panel, which seems pretty fair for its $249 price tag. It attaches to your laptop via a USB-C cable, but it&rsquo;ll also work over mini-HDMI or USB 2.0 if you&rsquo;re okay with less performance. A second USB-C port allows pass-through charging, a handy feature for travelers that we&rsquo;ve seen on designs like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/403333/lenovo-thinkvision-m14-usb-c-monitor-hands-on.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Lenovo&rsquo;s ThinkVision M14</a>. A shorty USB-C cable can be stored in the kickstand for easy stowage. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="NexPad monitor attached to laptop" class="wp-image-1363927" height="778" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/nexpad-with-laptop-white.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nex</p></div>



<p>No, what you&rsquo;re really paying for here is the design work. The massive &ldquo;chin&rdquo; beneath the screen is hiding several strong magnets, which attach to the rear of your laptop&rsquo;s screen. (If your laptop&rsquo;s hinge isn&rsquo;t strong enough to hold up the 1.6-pound screen, you can add some stability with the included magnetic kickstand.) Connect the USB-C cable, and you&rsquo;re ready to expand your workspace, touchscreen included. It&rsquo;ll run off your laptop&rsquo;s internal battery. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="NexPad attached to Android phone" class="wp-image-1363928" height="969" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/nexpad-with-smartphone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Nex</p></div>



<p>The NexPad can also work as a conventional portable monitor with a rather awkward blank space on the bottom, or use that massive magnet to stick an Android phone there and use a desktop-style screen mode, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407985/samsungs-galaxy-s9-debuts-with-big-changes-to-dex.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Samsung Dex</a>. All in all, it seems like a much more practical proposition than the company&rsquo;s previous design, the NexDock, which makes you carry around a laptop-sized gadget that relies on Android and gives up the advantages of Windows, ChromeOS, or macOS. And it doesn&rsquo;t hurt that it&rsquo;s a lot cheaper. </p>



<p>The NexPad is shipping now for $249. </p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>When it comes to long gaming sessions, the right headset can really make or break the experience. There&rsquo;s nothing worse than dealing with aching ears or a sore head. For me, comfort is a top priority. If you value comfort as much as I do, then you&rsquo;re in luck, as we&rsquo;ve got a kickass deal on an awesome gaming headset that actively keeps your ears cool even during the sweatiest play sessions. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/omen-by-hp-mindframe-prime-headset#techSpecs&amp;xcust=2-1-1363818-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">HP&rsquo;s selling the HP Mindframe Prime wired gaming headset for just $34.99</a>. That&rsquo;s a <em>massive</em> savings of $115. Let&rsquo;s get right into the details.</p>



<p>The best thing about this headset is the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402718/hp-omen-mindframe-headset-review.html">FrostCap thermoelectric technology</a>. The ear cushions are designed to redirect heat away from your face, which majorly ups the comfort factor. We&rsquo;ve tried this fascinating tech, and it&rsquo;s basically like an air conditioner for your ears&mdash;an especially welcome and unique feature when you&rsquo;re wearing the headset for hours on end. It&rsquo;s also powered by a C-Media Xear surround sound audio chip, which helps create a sense of spatial awareness. According to a review on the HP website, the quality is &ldquo;surprisingly better than you would expect.&rdquo; The only downside is that the microphone isn&rsquo;t detachable. It&rsquo;s not really a deal-breaker, per se, but it&rsquo;s still a little annoying. </p>



<p>This price is ridiculous in the best way possible, especially for a headset with active thermoelectric cooling technology. You should definitely pick it up before it&rsquo;s gone.</p>

## Why the iPad still can’t replace my laptop

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>For years, I&rsquo;ve wanted to be one of those people who can do all my work on an iPad.</p>



<p>The idea sounds so appealing: Instead of using a clunky laptop, just carry around Apple&rsquo;s lightweight tablet with a snap-on keyboard and trackpad. You&rsquo;ll get snappy performance, excellent battery life, fun apps, and fewer distractions. The way some <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90441293/why-the-ipad-is-my-personal-gadget-of-the-decade&amp;xcust=2-1-1362761-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">other tech writers</a> have <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.macstories.net/stories/beyond-the-tablet/&amp;xcust=2-1-1362761-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">pulled this off</a>&nbsp;has always made me a bit envious.</p>



<p>Yet whenever I try to spend serious time computing on an iPad, even with a keyboard attached, I always come <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">crawling back to my laptop</a> or desktop. The iPad might be where I go to focus on a single task or enjoy a change in computing scenery, but traditional PCs are where my serious work happens. (Case in point: I drafted this story on an iPad, but loaded it into WordPress with a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398828/lenovo-yoga-c940-14-review-a-2-in-1-convertible-laptop-thats-just-right.html">Lenovo Yoga C940 laptop</a>.)</p>



<p>With the new <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1356682/ipad-10th-generation-design-specs-features-price.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1362761-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed">10th-generation iPad</a>&nbsp;and its Surface-like Magic Keyboard Folio, Apple continues to push the laptop replacement concept. At some point, I&rsquo;ll almost certainly be tempted to give the idea yet another chance.</p>



<p>But as it stands, there are several reasons why I can only use my iPad as a temporary laptop stand-in.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>This column first appeared in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://advisorator.com/free&amp;xcust=2-1-1362761-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Advisorator</a>, Jared&rsquo;s weekly tech advice newsletter.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="the-screens-too-small">The screen&rsquo;s too small</h2>



<p>If you&rsquo;re used to working on a laptop, the 10- or 11-inch screens on most iPads will feel cramped while juggling lots of browser tabs or running two apps in split-screen mode. Even Apple&rsquo;s 12.9-inch iPad Pro is on the small side for a laptop. (It&rsquo;s also a big commitment to anti-laptop computing at $1,350 and up with a Magic Keyboard case.)</p>



<p>Making the switch might be more tempting if Apple offered a cheaper big-screen variant&mdash;like it does for the smaller iPad Pro with the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.macworld.com/article/625135/ipad-air-m1-review.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1362761-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed">10.9-inch iPad Air</a>&mdash;or expanded the iPad Pro to even larger sizes.</p>



<h2 id="file-management-can-still-be-hassle">File management can still be hassle</h2>



<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a roadblock I&rsquo;ve run into: After receiving a batch of images from Dropbox, I needed to upload them in Airtable. Sounds simple enough, but on the iPad, the Dropbox app wouldn&rsquo;t let me download the files. My only option was to delete the app, view the files through Dropbox&rsquo;s website, save the folder, open Airtable, choose the Files app as my upload source, and finally select the file.</p>



<p>An even bigger problem is that you can&rsquo;t reliably sync cloud storage sources such as OneDrive. Yes, you can connect OneDrive or other sources to Apple&rsquo;s Files app, but you can&rsquo;t automatically download folders for offline viewing, and sync operations have been extremely finicky in my experience. Maybe file management works better on the iPad with iCloud, but I&rsquo;m not going blow up my entire workflow just to find out.</p>



<h2 id="the-open-web-is-an-afterthought">The open web is an afterthought</h2>



<p>Apple likes to say that the iPad version of Safari is &ldquo;desktop class,&rdquo; meaning that it loads desktop sites instead of mobile versions and works well with a mouse or trackpad.</p>



<p>But whenever I&rsquo;m on my iPad, I miss having extensions like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://simpl.fyi/&amp;xcust=2-1-1362761-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Simplify Gmail</a> to improve Gmail&rsquo;s web version (which I&rsquo;d rather use than the mobile app), <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://camelcamelcamel.com/camelizer&amp;xcust=2-1-1362761-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">the Camelizer</a> to check Amazon price histories, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/706416/replace-chromes-new-tab-page-with-this-far-better-alternative.html">Tabliss</a> to make my new tab page more productive. Although Apple added extension support to Safari in iOS 15, the ecosystem still doesn&rsquo;t compare to that of a real desktop browser.</p>



<p>Other web-related frustrations abound on the iPad: You can&rsquo;t save websites to your home screen in any browser except Safari, and those that you do save sometimes open in new tabs instead of separate windows. (This is a problem for the web version of Gmail, which I&rsquo;d prefer to treat like a dedicated app.) On a laptop, the browser is my most important power tool, but it&rsquo;s relegated to just another app on the iPad.</p>



<h2 id="multitasking-remains-a-challenge">Multitasking remains a challenge</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Stage Manager on iPad OS 16" class="wp-image-1362765" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/stagemanager.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Stage Manager on iPad OS 16.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Apple</p></div>



<p>After all these years, Apple is still figuring out how to reinvent the multitasking wheel on the iPad. Launching apps in split-screen mode is easier than it used to be, but <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1341608/stage-manager-ipados-windows.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1362761-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed">Stage Manager</a>, Apple&rsquo;s new system for window management, has been <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.macstories.net/stories/stage-manager-ipados-16-1-review/&amp;xcust=2-1-1362761-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">widely regarded as a disaster</a>. Even the lack of a persistent, non-disappearing app dock makes the simple act of switching apps feel slow. The iPad can be great for work if you&rsquo;re focusing on a single app, but all that efficiency disappears the moment you need to bring in another app or data source.</p>



<h2 id="its-not-exactly-dockable-yet">It&rsquo;s not exactly dockable (yet)</h2>



<p>Later this year, Apple plans to add proper external display support for the iPad, giving you an interface that fills the entire monitor. But this feature only works on iPads with M1 or higher processors, ruling out the 10th-generation iPad that Apple just launched last week.</p>



<p>While you can still plug in other iPads to external monitors, those without USB-C output will be unbearably laggy, and you&rsquo;ll end up with a cramped 4:3 aspect ratio. Using an iPad at your desk with a full-sized display remains a work in progress.</p>



<h2 id="where-ipads-still-make-sense">Where iPads still make sense</h2>



<p>None of this means that you can&rsquo;t replace your laptop <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.macworld.com/article/670670/best-ipad-2021-which-ipad-to-buy.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1362761-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed">with an iPad</a>, but doing so requires throwing out lots of expectations about how to get things done. To me, that means the iPad still works best primarily as a tablet with occasional laptop benefits, rather than a device that serves both needs equally.</p>



<p>Of course, I could write the exact inverse of this article about replacing your iPad with a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/917881/best-2-in-1-laptops.html">convertible touchscreen laptop</a>. While my Lenovo Yoga C940 laptop folds into tablet mode, I almost never use it that way, and I&rsquo;d previously learned first-hand that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357826/microsoft-surface-pro-9-5g-review-an-arm-tablet-worth-buying.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface isn&rsquo;t great as a tablet</a> either. For reading books, watching videos, or playing touchscreen games, the iPad&rsquo;s instant-on, lightweight nature is still unparalleled.</p>



<p>Now, if someone could come up with a &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; level Chromebook tablet that runs Android and Linux apps&mdash;like a much fancier version of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://jarednewman.com/sendy/w/WD4bLNlO2zevWYsbDbLY892w/tRmzmhWmUerL5et995r892AA/6eZODzkxjGCJ892uSmx9zRkg&amp;xcust=2-1-1362761-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Lenovo&rsquo;s Chromebook Duet</a>&mdash;maybe we&rsquo;d have a device that feels more like the best of both worlds. But that&rsquo;s a whole other story.</p>

<p>PC gamers have flocked to LG&rsquo;s 4K OLED televisions since their introduction, and for good reason. These large, attractive, high-contrast displays offer a much better contrast ratio and superior HDR when compared to most desktop monitors. The LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B specifically targets this audience with features specific to the PC, like DisplayPort input and a high refresh rate. It mostly hits the mark.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: This review is part of our ongoing roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813361/best-4k-monitors.html">best 4K monitors</a>.

<h2 id="lg-ultragear-48gq900-b-the-specs">LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B: The specs</h2>



<p>The LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B is a 4K, 48-inch widescreen display. Its specifications are typical of any premium 4K monitor, but that&rsquo;s kind of the point. It includes DisplayPort, which is not found on most televisions, and has a maximum refresh rate of 138Hz.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Display size: 48-inch widescreen</li><li>Native resolution: 3840&times;2160</li><li>Panel type: OLED</li><li>Refresh rate: 138Hz</li><li>HDR: Yes, HDR10</li><li>Ports: 3x HDMI 2.1, 1x DisplayPort, 1x USB-B upstream, 2x USB-A, 1x 3.5mm audio out, 1x optical audio out</li><li>Stand adjustment: None</li><li>VESA mount: No</li><li>Speakers: Yes</li><li>Price: $1,499.99 MSRP ($1,199.99 typical).</li></ul><p>But the real star is, of course, the OLED panel, which hits an alluring MSRP of $1,499.99 (and it&rsquo;s often hundreds less when on sale). That&rsquo;s expensive, but it feels like a steal when compared to the $1,299.99 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/624305/alienware-aw3423dw-review-quantum-dot-oled-makes-rival-monitors-feel-obsolete.html">Alienware AW3423DW</a> or the $3,499 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1072564/asus-proart-oled-pa32dc-review.html">Asus ProArt PG32DC</a>.</p>



<h2 id="lg-ultragear-48gq900-b-design">LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B: Design</h2>



<p>Are you a gamer? Then you must like gamer things, right? That&rsquo;s clearly the thought behind the LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B. The monitor has an aggressive look with faux vents, a hexagonal pattern, and built-in LED lighting.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B" class="wp-image-1359645" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/lg-ultragear-48gq900-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>An aggressive design makes the LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B visually appealing to gamers.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s all a bit edgy for my tastes, yet I&rsquo;ll admit the built-in LED lighting can be useful. It&rsquo;s bright enough to provide luminance on a desk and can be used to replace an LED light strip behind or under your desktop.</p>



<p>LEDs aside, the monitor&rsquo;s looks are a moot point once it&rsquo;s set up. The display measures less than two inches thick at its thickest point and, because of its size, will usually be placed against a wall. Most people will never see the rear of the monitor except when connecting or disconnecting devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A wide silver stand holds the monitor aloft. Although large, it&rsquo;s not oversized relative to the display, which minimizes the monitor&rsquo;s footprint (the LG C2 OLED television, by comparison, has a much wider stand). The stand doesn&rsquo;t adjust, not even for tilt, which is normal for monitors of this size. A standard VESA monitor mount isn&rsquo;t included but TV wall mounts are supported.</p>



<h2 id="lg-ultragear-48gq900-b-features-and-menu">LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B: Features and menu</h2>



<p>LG packs a ton of connectivity in the Ultragear 48GQ900-B. Video input includes three HDMI 2.1 ports alongside one DisplayPort 1.4. This covers any scenario I can imagine. It&rsquo;s possible to connect a PC (through DisplayPort), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X at once&mdash;and still have room for a 4K streaming stick or box.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B" class="wp-image-1359646" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/lg-ultragear-48gq900-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B comes with a ton of connectivity options.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>It also includes 3.5mm audio and optical audio out, providing two options for passing through audio to a soundbar or speaker system. This is a feature not all monitors of this type provide, and it&rsquo;s an ideal arrangement if you want to use it in a PC-centric home theater. I used the optical output with my soundbar and had zero issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a USB-B upstream port that connects to two USB-A ports. This makes the monitor a basic USB hub, which is useful if you use wired peripherals. The monitor lacks USB-C and doesn&rsquo;t offer the expansive connectivity of a productivity-focused monitor like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/693931/dell-u3223qe-review.html">Dell Ultrasharp U3223QE</a>.</p>



<p>A bundled remote control is available for accessing the menu. It has a big, fat dial and just six buttons. It felt confusing to use at first but eventually won me over. This is a monitor, not a television, so a simplified layout makes sense.</p>



<p>The menus are well labeled and offer the usual range of adjustment. This includes four gamma plus and seven color temperature modes, though none promise to target a particular gamma curve or color temperature. It has six-aix color adjustment for saturation and hue. There&rsquo;s gaming options, too, such as a black stabilizer, built-in crosshair, and FPS counter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LG includes an sRGB mode that can be used to reel in the wide color gamut, if needed. However, DCI-P3 and Rec.709 modes are not available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B has built-in speakers. They&rsquo;re much better than what is typical of a monitor and sound good in general use at middling volume, but audio quality takes a dive as volume increases. The mid-range becomes muddy and harsh. Explosions in an action movie, for instance, sound more akin to static. It&rsquo;s fine on a desktop, where it&rsquo;s more likely to be used at low volume, but not suited for home theater.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s worth mentioning the LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B is a monitor, not a television, which means it doesn&rsquo;t have a TV tuner. It doesn&rsquo;t have a coaxial input and won&rsquo;t accept a traditional antenna or cable signal (without passing it through another device, at least).</p>



<h2 id="lg-ultragear-48gq900-b-sdr-image-quality">LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B: SDR image quality</h2>



<p>I&rsquo;ll start with a statement: Monitors are not televisions, televisions are not monitors, and the traits that make a display excel in one category may not make it better for the other. With that said, let&rsquo;s dig in, because there&rsquo;s a lot to talk about.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B" class="wp-image-1359647" height="817" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/lg-ultragear-48gq900-brightness.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>SDR brightness is very low at a maximum of 143 nits. That, as is obvious from the graph, lands way behind any other monitor that I&rsquo;ve recently tested. It&rsquo;s also quite far behind the Alienware AW3423DW, which like the Ultragear has an OLED panel (albeit a much different implementation). The Ultragear 48GQ900-B&rsquo;s performance is not unusual. Most OLED televisions will perform similarly when asked to display a bright, white image across the entire display.</p>



<p>Is this a problem? It could be. Brightness felt high in my home theater, but merely adequate on my desk, even when set to maximum brightness. A matte display coat helps diffuse light, but glare was a minor issue on sunny days. The monitor is ultimately best in a room with windows that can at least partially block sunlight and no harsh overhead lights.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B" class="wp-image-1359649" height="823" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/lg-ultragear-48gq900-contrast.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Contrast, on the flip side, is much better than average, with an effectively infinite contrast ratio. This is thanks to the OLED panel&rsquo;s ability to turn each pixel on or off individually. Pixels are almost perfectly black, appearing indistinct even in a pitch-black room. It&rsquo;s a big upgrade from the hazy, gray-ish look most monitors provide in dark scenes.</p>



<p>The great contrast ratio provides an excellent sense of depth and dimensionality. At times, when fed high-quality 4K content, the Ultragear 48GQ900-B&rsquo;s image begins to look 3D dimensional. It&rsquo;s a dramatic effect that won&rsquo;t be found on any LCD monitor lacking a Mini-LED backlight, and even those are not quite as effective.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B" class="wp-image-1359651" height="821" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/lg-ultragear-48gq900-color-gamut.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Color gamut came in strong, reaching across all of sRGB and 98 percent of DCI-P3. There are a few monitors that can beat the LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B: the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1072564/asus-proart-oled-pa32dc-review.html">Asus ProArt PG32DC</a>, a high-end professional OLED monitor, is one example. Still, a color gamut this wide is excellent for general use and provides a vivid, alluring look.</p>



<p>The monitor also supports 10-bit color, which helps cut down on the color banding that may appear in color gradients, such as the subtle hues of blue found in a skybox, or the mellow oranges and purples that surround a setting sun. Banding, when it is visible, pops up most often in grayscale&mdash;but it&rsquo;s still rather subtle. I doubt most viewers would ever notice.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B" class="wp-image-1359653" height="887" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/lg-ultragear-48gq900-color-accuracy.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Color accuracy, on the other hand&hellip;well, this is where things get complicated.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve listed color accuracy for default, sRGB, and software calibrated settings. I don&rsquo;t normally do this, because I judge a monitor&rsquo;s out-of-the-box experience to be its most important trait, and the default by which most people will judge it. In this case, however, default color accuracy was way off. Color accuracy was much better with some effort to bring it in line, though still not great.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few problems contribute to the Ultragear 48GQ900-B&rsquo;s out-of-box woes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, the default color temperature came in <em>way </em>too high at 10200K, off a target of 6500K. Second, gamma was off target with a gamma curve of 2.4. This means the image appears much cooler, more blue, and darker than it should.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a usable image, but the color issues are apparent and left me unhappy. It was bad enough that I tested the display with a second computer, which I don&rsquo;t normally do. The results persisted.</p>



<p>A calibration mostly resolves the problem. The Ultragear 48GQ900-B remained relatively inaccurate, but close enough for general use. Given its other strengths, I would accept this level of error in exchange for the monitor&rsquo;s contrast ratio, HDR performance, and color accuracy, which I&rsquo;ll talk more about shortly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sharpness can also be an issue, depending on how the monitor is used. This may seem surprising for a 4K monitor, but the 4K 48-inch panel works out to only 91 pixels per inch. Pixel density is almost identical to a 24-inch 1080p monitor.</p>

<p>Finally, the Ultragear 48GQ900-B has a RWBG pixel layout rather than the RGB layout common to most monitors. This is a problem because Windows is optimized for RGB. The monitor shows noticeable fringing around text which can cause it to appear blocky or pixelated when it should appear smooth. It&rsquo;s an issue the monitor shares with the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/624305/alienware-aw3423dw-review-quantum-dot-oled-makes-rival-monitors-feel-obsolete.html">Alienware AW3423DW</a>. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1072564/asus-proart-oled-pa32dc-review.html">Asus&rsquo; ProArt PA32DC</a>, which is more expensive, doesn&rsquo;t have this issue.</p>



<p>SDR performance is a mix, then. The contrast ratio is excellent, and the color gamut is wide, but brightness and color accuracy are notable issues. The Ultragear 48GQ900-B&rsquo;s problems can make it inconvenient to use and prevent it from working well in professional workflows. It&rsquo;s a much better monitor for entertainment than productivity.</p>



<h2 id="lg-ultragear-48gq900-b-hdr-image-quality">LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B: HDR image quality</h2>



<p>The LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B&rsquo;s HDR performance is important given its intended use. Though it might be used on a desk, it can also be used in a home theater, in which case it&rsquo;ll spend more time in HDR mode than in SDR.</p>



<p>I measured a maximum full-screen HDR brightness of 221 nits. That&rsquo;s low, falling well behind a typical IPS edge-lit monitor and way, way behind Mini-LED displays. It&rsquo;s also behind the Alienware AW3423DW, which hit 325 nits, and the Asus ProArt PA32DC, which reached 540 nits.</p>



<p>Brightness can ramp up to more than 400 nits in a 10 percent window (in other words, when only 10 percent of the display panel is lit). Other reviewers, such as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ign.com/articles/lg-ultragear-48gq900-review&amp;xcust=2-1-1359629-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">IGN</a>, have noted up to 600 nits in a one-percent window, which is not a situation I&rsquo;m set up to test.</p>



<p>Whether this level of brightness is good or bad has a lot to do with how, and where, you use the monitor. Brightness felt excellent when placed in my darkly lit home theater but remained less impressive in my office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But let&rsquo;s be real: Whatever the brightness, the Ultragear 48GQ900-B demolishes the performance of any monitor lacking an OLED panel or Mini-LED backlight. Most monitors have no problem with brightness but are lacking in contrast, so they can&rsquo;t handle the range of luminance HDR provides. This monitor&rsquo;s excellent contrast helps to fix that issue, which results in a richer, deeper image.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also benefits from a well-behaved brightness limiter. This is a downside of Alienware&rsquo;s AW3423DW, which can suffer aggressive and obvious swings in brightness when transitioning between scenes of significantly different brightness, or when bright objects (like a Word document) are resized. This comes into play with the Ultragear 48GQ900-B, but transitions are more muted and less distracting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On a final note, the Ultragear 48GQ900-B only supports HDR10 (which means it doesn&rsquo;t support Dolby Vision). I don&rsquo;t see this as a problem because Dolby Vision HDR isn&rsquo;t frequently used on the PC. However, this might be a concern if you plan to use the monitor in a home theater. Overall, the LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B&rsquo;s HDR performance is great. Personally, I prefer the brighter and more stable presentation of a Mini-LED display, like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/810180/asus-rog-swift-pg32uqx-monitor-review.html">Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX</a> or Viewsonic XG321UG, but LG&rsquo;s alternative is excellent. It&rsquo;s a compelling HDR experience that will have you eager to use HDR whenever possible.</p>



<h2 id="lg-ultragear-48gq900-b-motion-clarity">LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B: Motion clarity</h2>



<p>Motion performance is key to the LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B&rsquo;s appeal. It supports overclocking to a maximum refresh rate of 138Hz and is compatible with both Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B" class="wp-image-1359655" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/lg-ultragear-48gq900-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Motion clarity is superb at both 138Hz and 120Hz. Fine detail is preserved when panning a camera in a 3D game and small objects are easy to track when moving across the scene. Details like character models and health bars remain visible when moving the camera across the map in <em>League of Legends</em>. Text displaying character names is only sometimes legible, but that&rsquo;s still a great result at these refresh rates. Such text usually isn&rsquo;t legible on a monitor with a refresh rate below 240Hz.</p>



<p>Even 60Hz looks good which, given the Ultragear 48GQ900-B&rsquo;s intended use, is a wonderful trait. PC users won&rsquo;t have trouble making full use of high refresh rates, but console games often render at just 60fps (or lower). The monitor looks good in these situations, as it can preserve some fine to medium details when panning a camera or tracking a fast object.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have just two nits to pick. First, the 138Hz overclock is more of a marketing ploy than a real, useful feature, as the difference between 138Hz and 120Hz isn&rsquo;t noticeable. The monitor also lacks a backlight strobing feature to further improve motion clarity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even so, the Ultragear 48GQ900-B&rsquo;s overall motion performance is remarkable. It ranks alongside the motion performance of Alienware&rsquo;s AW3423DW and delivers a noticeable, improvement over IPS and VA-panel monitors with a 144Hz or 120Hz refresh rate.</p>



<h2 id="lg-ultragear-48gq900-b-vs-lg-c2-oled">LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B vs. LG C2 OLED</h2>



<p>PC owners looking for a large OLED display might compare the LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B with the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/LG-42-Inch-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED42C2PUA/dp/B09RMHBXYX?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1359629-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">LG C2 OLED</a>. They both carry a retail MSRP of $1,499.99, and both are currently on sale at multiple retailers for $1,199. They are similar in size and seem to promise similar performance. So, what&rsquo;s the difference?</p>



<p>The LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B, as mentioned, is a monitor. It doesn&rsquo;t have the TV tuner, smart TV apps, and AI image processor found in the LG C2 OLED. In exchange, the 48GQ900-B gains DisplayPort, a USB hub, and a higher maximum refresh rate of 138Hz. The lack of image processor is also arguably a perk because it reduces latency. LG&rsquo;s C2 OLED offers a game mode which gets around this, but the Ultragear 48GQ900-B doesn&rsquo;t need that. It&rsquo;s always in game mode.</p>



<p>Because of these differences, the LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B is better for playing games or viewing content on a PC, while the LG C2 OLED is superior for streaming, 4K Blu-Ray movies, and over-the-air TV.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both are great for console gaming, though I&rsquo;d say the LG C2 OLED has an edge because of its support for Dolby Vision HDR, which is available on Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-lg-ultragear-48gq900-b">Should you buy the LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B?</h2>



<p>The LG Ultragear 48GQ900-B&rsquo;s performance is hard to summarize. It&rsquo;s a display that has incredible strengths, such as its HDR performance and motion clarity, and obvious weaknesses, like out-of-box color problems and low SDR brightness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I can say this: I like it. The monitor looks gorgeous when playing modern titles like <em>Deathloop</em>, of course, but it&rsquo;s also amazing in older games. <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>, played at 4K with high-resolution textures and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/546269/auto-hdr-deep-dive-how-and-why-to-use-windows-11s-eye-catching-game-feature.html">Windows Auto HDR </a>on, looks fantastic. It&rsquo;s painful to go back to an IPS panel monitor after seeing this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pricing is the final, and important, factor. The Ultragear 48GQ900-B debuted at an MSRP of $1,499.99, but it&rsquo;s now on sale at multiple retailers (and listed on LG&rsquo;s website) at $1,199.99. That&rsquo;s no bargain, but it&rsquo;s less expensive than a number of smaller Mini-LED and OLED monitors. The Ultragear 48GQ900-B is a solid, though not flawless, choice if you want a huge screen for your PC.</p>
