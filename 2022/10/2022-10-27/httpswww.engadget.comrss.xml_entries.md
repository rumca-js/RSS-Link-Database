<p>Apple seems to be weathering the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-recruiter-layoffs-145900949.html">financial storm</a>, albeit with a few hitches. The company <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/10/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/">reported</a> a record high revenue of $90.1 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, with a net profit of $20.7 billion. While those were only slight increases versus the same period last year (revenue was up 'just' 8 percent), they came despite a rough economic climate and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-earnings-q3-2022-macs-wearables-revenues-210542271.html">near-flat revenue growth</a> in the previous quarter.</p><p>The issues mainly stem from mixed performance across Apple's lineup. It won't surprise you to hear that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-14-pro-max-review-dynamic-island-useful-always-on-display-battery-life-camera-test-sample-pictures-130020449.html">iPhone 14 debut</a> helped fuel the company's mobile revenue ($42.6 billion versus last summer's $38.9 billion), but other segments were volatile. While the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-review-2022-130040098.html">MacBook Air M2</a> helped Mac revenue jump 25 percent to $11.5 billion, iPad sales dropped sharply — they fell to just under $7.2 billion versus nearly $8.3 billion a year earlier. And while services like Apple Music and TV+ set a new record of $19.2 billion, that's only a mediocre bump versus the $18.3 billion from a year ago. Sales for the Apple Watch and smart home devices grew solidly from $8.8 billion to $9.7 billion.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The customer base appears to be strong, at least. During Apple's earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri noted that roughly half of Mac and iPad buyers were new to the platform. The company also touted an all-time (but unspecified) high for the number of active devices. CEO Tim Cook added that phone sales were strong despite tight supply constraints for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max.</p><p>The fall (Apple's first fiscal quarter of 2023) could be rosier. Apple introduced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-2022-refresh-preview-130006762.html">new iPads</a> in October this year where it released updated models in September last year, so we'd expect a bump in sales for the tablet lineup. Cook added that last year was "unusually strong" thanks to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2021-m1-review-liquid-retina-xdr-5g-features-price-130049005.html">iPad Pro M1</a> launch. The iPhone 14 family had also been available for just eight days during the fourth quarter, so overall iPhone sales should improve.</p><p>Apple isn't out of trouble yet. It's still hiring more cautiously, and supply issues (including for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-ultra-review-battery-life-compass-gps-hike-130055477.html">Apple Watch Ultra</a>, Cook says) may dog the company for a while. It's also unclear how people will take to devices like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/i-phone-14-plus-review-bigger-screen-better-battery-life-040056936.html">iPhone 14 Plus</a>, which didn't ship until this month. All the same, Apple may be happy. The computer market <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-10-10-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-declined-19-percent-in-third-quarter-of-2022">tanked</a> 19.5 percent during the quarter, according to Gartner estimates, while Canalys <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-market-Q3-2022">believes</a> smartphone shipments dropped 9 percent. If those figures are reasonably accurate, Apple is thriving simply by avoiding sharp declines in most categories.</p>

## NASA's InSight lander detected a meteoroid impact on Mars

<p>NASA's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-07-nasa-insight-lander-ready-to-get-to-work.html">InSight lander</a> may have had its last hurrah. Researchers have <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-insight-lander-detects-stunning-meteoroid-impact-on-mars">learned</a> that a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-23-nasa-insight-lander-records-marsquake.html">marsquake</a> the lander detected in Mars' Amazonis Planitia region on December 24th, 2021 was actually a meteoroid impact — the first time any mission has witnessed a crater forming on the planet. Scientists found out when they looked at before-and-after pictures from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) revealing a 492-foot gash in the landscape.</p><p>The meteoroid is believed to have been somewhere between 16 and 39 feet long. It would have burned up in Earth's skies, but it was large enough to survive Mars' extra-thin atmosphere. The impact was violent, digging a hole 70 feet deep and tossing debris as far as 23 miles away from the crater. It also exposed subsurface ice that hasn't been seen so close to the martian equator before now. A sound adaptation of Insight's data (below) shows just how "loud" the event was compared to Mars' regular activity.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="534aa23a04464c5aa147500f3010075b"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>It took some time to confirm the event. A Malin Space Science Systems team used two of the MRO's cameras (the black-and-white Context Camera and the Mars Color Imager) to spot the crater in February. Pictures from the color camera helped narrow down the impact to a 24-hour window.</p><p>Separately, a group has suggested that 20 of InSight's roughly 1,300 detected marsquakes may be signs of magma. As <em>Gizmodo</em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/nasa-insight-mars-meteorites-magma-seismic-waves-1849709271">explains</a>, the quakes' spectral signature hints at a comparatively soft crust in Mars' Cerberus Fossae region. Combined with dark dust, this hints that volcanic activity might have occurred on the planet within the past 50,000 years.</p><p>The discovery could help the scientific community understand <a href="https://www.engadget.com/curiosity-rover-megafloods-mars-082618479.html">Mars' geologic timeline</a> by defining the rate of craters appearing on the planet. It might also prove crucial to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-it-will-take-for-humans-to-colonize-the-moon-and-mars-160026478.html">Mars colonists</a> and explorers who may need the underground ice for sustenance and rocket fuel.  Human visitors could carry fewer supplies, or extend their stays.</p><div id="77ef9007694140b681702048135c041b"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>There's a bittersweetness to this news. NASA previously warned that InSight <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-mars-insight-lander-farewell-095620031.html">couldn't last much longer</a>, and now expects the lander to shut down in six weeks as accumulating dust limits the effectiveness of its solar panels. That's better than the end-of-summer cutoff the agency predicted this spring, but it could leave the meteorite detection as InSight's last major accomplishment.</p>

## Surface Pro 9 5G review (SQ3): A beautiful lie

<p>Can you believe it's been 10 years since Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-10-16-microsoft-surface-behind-the-scenes.html">first launched the Surface</a>? That's a decade of trying to make hybrid tablet PCs a thing, something I'm still not sure many people actually want. But, you know what, I'll give Microsoft credit for trying to push laptop designs forward in an era when everyone was trying to copy Apple's unibody MacBook Pro and ultra-thin <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-review-2022-130040098.html">MacBook Air</a>. The Surface was a radical alternative.</p><p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NzA3MTYwNS1kNGRmLTQ5NGUtOGQ5Yy1jOWMyMzZiOGJiMzgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi11cy9kL3N1cmZhY2UtcHJvLTkvOTN2a2Q4bnA0ZnZrP2FjdGl2ZXRhYj1waXZvdCUzYW92ZXJ2aWV3dGFiIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2NmU2MGI4Ni1hZTc2LTRmYmEtYWI3Zi01ZTFkODVlYmI3NDIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUL4JvcD10KsUcgNJIBhBNaXC5kRCbqjBAYPQKd3hTRe&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-9%2F93vkd8np4fvk%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab">Surface Pro 9 with 5G</a> makes it clear that Microsoft has learned some lessons since its first tablets: It's impeccably designed, and it's the first Surface to tap into speedy 5G networks. Unfortunately, it's also a disappointing reminder that Microsoft can't help but repeat many of its earlier mistakes. It's yet another ARM-based Windows PC that we can't possibly recommend.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That's not exactly surprising, given our lukewarm reaction to the ARM-powered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-05-microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-price-specs-availability-windows-arm-lte.html">Surface Pro X</a> line. But what's more galling this year is that Microsoft is actually calling it the Surface Pro 9 with 5G, as if it's directly comparable to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-pro-9-hands-on-intel-arm-152933337.html">Surface Pro 9 powered by Intel's 12th-gen chips</a>. That's more than hubris – it's an outright lie, one that will undoubtedly confuse shoppers and IT workers for the next year.</p><p>Sure, they both have the same gorgeous and impressively thin aluminum case, 13-inch PixelSense display, and very usable keyboard covers (which are unfortunately still sold separately). Both models also have the same built-in kickstand, which lets you prop up the screen on a table, or if you're feeling risky, on your leg for on-the-go computing. If you've seen a Surface tablet before, especially last year's solid Pro 8, not much has changed.</p><figure><img alt="Surface Pro 9 with 5G" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/327be5d1-5601-11ed-bfef-2b8655f752d3" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><h2>A tale of two Surfaces</h2><p>Here's the rub: Microsoft now has one product line running on two very different chip designs, Intel's x86 hardware and Microsoft's custom SQ3 ARM system-on-a-chip (itself based on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3). The Intel-powered Surface Pro 9 can run all of the legacy Windows apps you'd expect. The SQ3 model, on the other hand, can only run newer apps natively. Everything else is emulated, leading to significantly slower performance. On the plus side, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-2022-update-accessibility-170013018.html">Windows 11</a> supports x64 emulation now, so the Pro 9 with 5G can run plenty of apps that the Pro X couldn't when it launched. But that doesn't cover games, and it's a compromise I don't think anyone should be making at this point.</p><p>What's even more frustrating is that Microsoft is making you pay a $300 premium above the $999 Surface Pro 9 for the privilege of owning an inherently slower computer. How much is built-in 5G worth to you, then?</p><figure><img alt="Surface Pro 9 with 5G" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/32a39210-5601-11ed-9bdb-f2493cef8da9" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><h2>A better Windows on Arm experience, but not by much</h2><p>After using the Pro 9 with 5G for several days, I'm even more baffled by Microsoft's reckless attempt at shoving its x86 and ARM product lines together. While a few of the company's engineers assured me in a recent interview that the performance would be comparable between the SQ3 and Intel models, I knew that was inaccurate the minute I launched Chrome. As an emulated x86 app, it's slower to launch and fairly laggy while browsing the web and juggling tabs. Microsoft Edge, on the other hand, is snappier all around because it's<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-07-edge-chrome-80-arm64.html"> a native ARM app</a>.</p><p>I typically run multiple browsers at once, since it's the easiest way to separate work and personal accounts. I can't just move to Edge full time. So if I wanted to work the way I'm used to on the Surface Pro 9 with 5G, I'd just have to live with an experience that's worse than a three-year-old Surface Laptop. Does that sound like progress to you? While it performed generally fine with native apps like Spotify and Evernote, multitasking between them and emulated apps still felt noticeably sluggish. In many ways, it felt like a step down from the Surface Pro 6 I reviewed four years ago, save for the silkier 120Hz refresh rate on the Pro 9's larger screen.</p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p>Geekbench 5 CPU</p></td><td><p>3DMark Wildlife Extreme</p></td><td><p>Cinebench R23</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Microsoft Surface Pro 9 5G (SQ3, Adreno 8cx Gen 3)</p></td><td><p>1,122/5,764</p></td><td><p>2,959</p></td><td><p>575/1,866</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Microsoft Surface Pro 8 (Intel Core i7-1185G7, Intel Iris Xe graphics)</p></td><td><p>1,289/5,217</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>620/4,619</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Microsoft Surface Laptop Go 2 (Intel i5-1135G7, Iris Xe graphics)</p></td><td><p>1,349/3,764</p></td><td><p>2,799</p></td><td><p>1,127/3,115</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS Zenbook 17 Fold OLED (Intel i7-1280P, Iris Xe graphics)</p></td><td><p>1,596/6,491</p></td><td><p>3,012</p></td><td><p>1,504/5,384</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>All of the benchmarks I ran on the Surface Pro 9 also show that it's slower than any premium laptop we've reviewed over the past few years. Sure, Geekbench 5 was running as a slower emulated app, but its score is also indicative of how other emulated programs will run. Even the weak Surface Go 2, with its low-power 11th-gen Intel chip, managed to outperform the Pro 9 5G in single-core performance. (At least the SQ3 faired better with multi-core speeds.) 3DMark's Wildlife Extreme test, which is one of the best ways to compare cross-platform gaming, also returned a low score, as I expected. (The bigger surprise? It was on par with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenbook-17-fold-oled-review-specs-price-great-screen-now-do-the-keyboard-131547070.html">ASUS ZenBook Fold 17</a>, a foldable computer held back by a low-wattage Intel chip.)</p><section><img alt="Surface Pro 9 with 5G" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/32d52960-5601-11ed-bfff-ccef3ce84ff8" /></section><p>While I don't think many people would be buying the 5G Surface Pro 9 for its performance alone, it's still worth reiterating that it'll be a far slower computer than its Intel counterpart. I didn't have that other Pro 9 model to test, but we did review the ASUS ZenBook Fold 17, which uses a similar Intel Core i7-1250U CPU. That's a low-power chip but otherwise comparable to the i7-1255U on the Surface Pro 9. Compared to the SQ3 Pro 9, the ZenBook blew it away in Geekbench 5's CPU test, as well as Cinebench R23.</p><p>Surprisingly, both the ZenBook Fold 17 and 5G Pro 9 scored similarly in the Wildlife Extreme benchmark, but the Intel chip has the advantage of being able to run games natively. The Pro 9 5G couldn't even successfully emulate older titles like <em>Quake</em> on Steam. (For the truly desperate, you can always stream Xbox Game Pass titles over the cloud, and a handful of low-power native games like <em>Minecraft</em> run fine.)</p><figure><img alt="Surface Pro 9 with 5G" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/327be5d2-5601-11ed-b3fd-11ff8ed5d414" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><h2>What good is built-in cellular?</h2><p>The Surface Pro 9's built-in 5G connectivity gives it one major leg up over the Intel model, but I didn't find it very compelling during my testing. During cellular setup, Windows directed me to Ubigi and Gigsky as two potential providers that would connect to the Surface's eSIM. I went with Ubigi, and after 20 minutes of account setup, I was able to hop onto their LTE network. Unfortunately, I didn't see any 5G speeds in my Atlanta suburb, but the network still delivered a respectable 33.6 Mbps down and (far less impressive) 2 Mbps up over LTE.</p><p>If you already have a working SIM card, you can open up the Pro 9's expansion area under the kickstand and slide it in there. My Verizon SIM was recognized in 30 seconds, and it delivered 50 Mbps down and 4 Mbps up over LTE. You can also easily swap out the notebook's SSD in that expansion area too, something we could never do before. In exchange, though, Microsoft removed the SD card slot. I wouldn't consider that a dealbreaker — being able to upgrade to a larger SSD down the line is incredibly useful — but it's something to keep in mind if you rely on SD cards to store your music or photos.</p><p>Having the ability to hop on cellular everywhere, especially for international providers like Ubigi, is certainly impressive. Personally, though, I'd trade that in for the increased speed and app compatibility from the Intel Surface Pro 9. Is it really that tough to tether your phone? And true road warriors are likely better off with a mobile hotspot, which can connect to multiple devices easily.</p><figure><img alt="Surface Pro 9 with 5G" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/327c0ce0-5601-11ed-aff7-6b35615f2892" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><h2>Same Surface issues, 10 years later</h2><p>Perhaps I'm just grumpy from the whole forced ARM transition, but I also couldn't help but be frustrated by the other annoyances from the Surface Pro 9. Microsoft has been pumping these things out for a decade now, and they're still annoying to use on your lap. Unlike a traditional laptop, which has a flat base connected to a screen, you have to juggle the Surface's keyboard cover and kickstand on your leg to keep it propped up. It's functional enough — I was able to type this whole review with the Surface on my lap — but not exactly comfortable.</p><p>I've been able to bear it for years, but by this point, it'd be nice to see Microsoft try <em>something</em> to improve the experience. Maybe add a secondary hinge to stabilize things, or offer a case that can completely unify the keyboard and tablet (like<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-29-hp-spectre-folio-review.html"> HP's leather-clad Spectre Folio</a>). With ultraportables like the MacBook Air and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-13-plus-review-beauty-usability-120015270.html">Dell XPS 13</a> getting lighter and thinner every year, Microsoft can't just assume consumers will live with subpar ergonomics. Perhaps the tradeoff would be worth it if the Surface was usable as a tablet on its own, but I still find it too large and unwieldy compared to the iPad Pro. (And it’s not like Windows is any better on tablets, either.)</p><p>There are still some nice design ideas around the Surface — I love the way the Slim Pen 2 hides away in the $180 Signature Pro keyboard, and it remains one of the best stylii on the market when it comes to drawing and jotting down notes. Still, it feels like the Surface is turning into a computer that's more performative than it is functional. Look at its kickstand! Don't worry about how impractical it is. It's got 5G! But ignore the fact that it has a slow mobile processor. Even its two USB-C ports are compromised; they're limited to USB 3.2, whereas the Intel model's ports all support the faster Thunderbolt 4 standard.</p><section><img alt="Surface Pro 9 5G video chat" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/0d87ed60-5614-11ed-bfff-203fc754d2b4" /></section><h2>AI-assisted video chats</h2><p>Oddly enough, there's one thing the 5G Surface Pro 9 excels at: video calls. It sports a sharp 1080p front-facing camera, but crucially, it's assisted by the SQ3's Neural Processing Unit. That powers features like automatic framing, background blurring and sustained eye contact during video calls. And in my experience, it's almost magical. The portrait blurring effects are close to what I'd expect from a larger DSLR camera, and the automatic framing was silky smooth. Those features also work across any video chat app, so you don't have to worry about looking different across Zoom or Teams.</p><p>The one downside of the Intel-powered Surface Pro 9 is that it can't take advantage of any of those features. While Intel's 12th-gen CPUs are plenty powerful, they don't have an NPU built-in. Microsoft reps say any future chips that add AI processing will be able to use these features, but that doesn't help people buying Intel Pro 9 models this year. At the very least, they'll have a good front-facing camera (as well as a very capable 10-megapixel rear camera).</p><figure><img alt="Surface Pro 9 with 5G" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/327be5d0-5601-11ed-bebc-efd2f3532a28" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>If you're still interested in the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NzA3MTYwNS1kNGRmLTQ5NGUtOGQ5Yy1jOWMyMzZiOGJiMzgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi11cy9kL3N1cmZhY2UtcHJvLTkvOTN2a2Q4bnA0ZnZrP2FjdGl2ZXRhYj1waXZvdCUzYW92ZXJ2aWV3dGFiIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2NmU2MGI4Ni1hZTc2LTRmYmEtYWI3Zi01ZTFkODVlYmI3NDIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUL4JvcD10KsUcgNJIBhBNaXC5kRCbqjBAYPQKd3hTRe&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-9%2F93vkd8np4fvk%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab">5G Surface Pro 9</a>, having read my complaints and frustrations, be prepared to pay dearly.

Jumping up to 16GB of RAM with the 5G Pro 9 (like our review unit) will cost you $1,600 with 256GB of storage. As you go up the price range, the Intel and SQ3 models end up costing the same — but who wants to pay nearly $2,000 for an ARM-based Windows PC?</p><p>Perhaps one day, Microsoft's dream of an ultra-thin, ARM-powered Surface will come true. But the company has failed at every attempt to make that happen (my condolences to anyone who bought the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-10-23-microsoft-surface-rt-review.html">Surface RT</a>). The 5G Pro 9 is an improvement, but its beauty belies its many practical issues. If you're at all interested in a new Surface, buy the Intel model and get a hotspot on the side. You'll be far happier.</p>

## Elon Musk to advertisers: Twitter ‘cannot become a free-for-all hellscape’

<p>One day before Elon Musk is expected to finalize his deal to buy Twitter, he’s attempting to reassure the platform’s advertisers that he won’t turn the platform into a “free-for-all hellscape.” In a message posted Thursday, Musk tried to explain why he wanted to buy the company, and that he doesn’t intend to blow up its advertising business.</p><p>“There had been much speculation about why I bought Twitter and what I think about advertising,” he wrote. “Most of it has been wrong.

But that stance has upset many Twitter employees, and worried the company’s advertisers. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-will-face-an-early-twitter-challenge-preventing-advertiser-flight-11666871828"><ins>reported</ins></a> that some advertisers have even threatened to “pause all their ads” if the company gives Donald Trump his account back — something Musk has said he <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-he-would-reverse-donald-trump-twitter-ban-182237750.html"><ins>would likely</ins></a> do.</p><p>While Musk didn’t walk back those comments, he said he wanted Twitter to “be warm and welcoming to all.” He added that people should be able to “choose your desired experience according to your preferences, just as you can choose, for example, to see movies or play video games ranging from all ages to mature.”</p><p>Musk’s comments come just after he visited Twitter’s office and reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-wont-layoff-75-percent-of-staff-122948434.html"><ins>told employees</ins></a> that he won’t be axing 75 percent of its staff as earlier reports had suggested.

But though Musk responded favorably to the idea at the time, his message to advertisers now sounds very different.</p><p>“I also very much believe that advertising, when done right, can delight, entertain and inform you,” Musk wrote. "For this to be true, it is essential to show Twitter users advertising that is as relevant as possible to their needs. Low relevancy ads are spam, but highly relevant ads are actually content."</p><p>“Fundamentally, Twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world that strengthens your brand and grows your enterprise.”</p>

## Twitch hopes its rewritten community policies are easier to understand

<p>Twitch is continuing its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-2022-safety-plans-232940991.html">ongoing safety reforms</a> with a simple but potentially useful move: writing its policies in plain language. <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/">The company</a> has rewritten its Community Guidelines to provide what it believes is a clearer structure with simpler wording, more context and practical examples. This includes new top-level categories (such as "Civility &amp; Respect" and "Sensitive Content") and more logical category groupings, such as a "Youth Safety" section that covers everything related to users under 18. Some violations now have dedicated categories, such as "Sexual Harassment" and "<a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-banning-major-gambling-websites-in-october-035510335.html">Prohibited Games</a>."</p><p>The livestreaming service emphasizes that the guidelines themselves haven't changed. This is an effort to make the rules more usable. In theory, at least, you'll see fewer inadvertent violations and more people reporting misbehavior. Twitch pointed to past revisions as an example of what could happen. When it enacted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-harassment-hate-rules-2021-195214959.html">clearer rules for hate and harassment</a> at the start of 2021, it saw both a 920 percent year-over-year surge in enforcement as well as a 511 percent jump in valid user reports.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The rewrite is an acknowledgment that Twitch's lack of clarity has sometimes led to very real problems for creators. The service <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twich-pools-hot-tubs-and-beaches-category-213240852.html">added a "Hot Tubs" category</a> last year in part because its previous approach (lumping these streamers into the "Just Chatting" section) led to ambiguity for both users and advertisers concerned broadcasters were flouting the rules. Twitch also revised the language for its sexual content policy, and in June streamlined its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-self-harm-policy-update-134527571.html">approach to mentions of self-harm</a>.</p><p>Twitch says it will continue refining the policies themselves, including a "more comprehensive" revision of its sexual content material. The clarification isn't going to satisfy users concerned about the effectiveness of the guidelines. It may result in fewer accusations of unfair bans and demonetization, though, and might make it easier for Twitch to expand policies over time.</p>

## FCC proposes rules to prevent fake emergency alerts

<p>The Federal Communications Commission is well aware of the potential <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-21-fema-presidential-alerts-spoofing.html">damage from fake emergency alerts</a>, and it's hoping to minimize the threat with policy changes. The agency has <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-strengthen-security-emergency-alert-systems">proposed</a> rules that would require stricter security for the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and Wireless Emergency Alerts. Participants and telecoms would have to not only report EAS breaches within 72 hours, but provide yearly certifications that they both have "sufficient" safeguards and a risk management plan.</p><p>The proposed rules would also require phone carriers to send authentication data ensuring that only legitimate emergency alerts reach customer devices. The FCC is similarly looking for comments on the effectiveness of the current requirements for transmitting EAS notices, and suggestions for "alternative approaches" with improvements.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The proposal comes three years after University of Colorado researchers warned that it was easy to spoof FEMA's presidential alerts, with no way to verify the authenticity of the broadcasts. And while the 2018 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-26-hawaii-senator-wants-feds-handle-future-nuclear-attack-alert.html">Hawaii missile alert</a> was the result of an error rather than a hack, it underscored the risks associated with false warnings. Even at small scales, a fake alert could reach tens of thousands of people, possibly leading to panic and reduced trust in real messages.</p><p>It's not certain if the proposals are enough. The 72-hour window may help prevent some false alerts, but not all of them — that's plenty of time for a hacker to both breach an emergency system and send fake messages. It's likewise unclear if the FCC would update its security requirements to keep up with evolving threats. Even so, this shows that the Commission is at least aware of the dangers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/youtube/"><ins>YouTube</ins></a> is attempting to make it easier for folks to find reliable and high-quality health information on the platform. It's opening up its health product features to certain healthcare professionals and information providers in the US. It <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/introducing-new-ways-help-you-find-answers-your-health-questions/">started offering those features</a> last year to educational institutions, public health departments, hospitals and government bodies. "This new step will allow us to expand to include high quality information from a wider group of healthcare channels," Dr. Garth Graham, the global head of YouTube Health, <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/new-ways-licensed-healthcare-professionals-product-feature-application/"><ins>wrote in a blog post</ins></a>.</p><p>The features include labels under videos that clearly state the information is coming from a healthcare professional or accredited organization. When a user searches for a term such as "bipolar" or "breast cancer," they may see a carousel of videos under the label “From health sources” near the top of the search results.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>YouTube says healthcare professionals can apply for the program starting today. They'll need to submit proof of their medical license and for their YouTube account to be in good standing. They'll also need to follow the Council of Medical Specialty Societies, the National Academy of Medicine and the World Health Organization best practices for sharing health information. YouTube plans to expand the program to more markets and other types of medical specialties.</p><p>Helping people obtain credible health information from a verified professional is inherently a positive move. YouTube will still have to tread carefully with this program, given the COVID-19 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-anti-vaccine-video-ban-channel-takedowns-134545387.html"><ins>vaccine misinformation</ins></a> that has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-covid-19-misinformation-takedowns-201041091.html"><ins>rife on the platform</ins></a> over the last few years. Meanwhile, YouTube <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9795167?hl=en"><ins>points out</ins></a> that people shouldn't consider health-related information they learn from verified professionals as medical advice (and nor will the videos apply to everyone). You'd still be best served to get in touch with a healthcare provider if you have a medical concern and to contact emergency services if the need arises.</p>

We were particularly impressed in the sound department: it's not purely neutral, and it can't match pricier models like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218.html">Apple's AirPods Pro</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-3-earbuds-announced-220016884.html">Sennheiser's Momentum True Wireless 3</a>, but the overall clarity is greater than what you typically get for less than $100, let alone $50, and the bass-forward profile lends tracks a nice amount of body.&nbsp;</p><p>We found the Elite 3's compact design to be light and comfortable in the ear, with reliable physical control buttons on each earpiece. The buds also an IP55 dust and water resistance rating, which is enough to survive most workouts. Battery life comes in at roughly seven hours of continuous use, which is good, with another 20-ish hours available through the included charging case. A recent firmware update also added the ability to create a custom EQ profile, addressing one of the issues we had in our initial review.</p><p>To be clear, these are still Jabra's "budget" earbuds, so their overall feature set is limited compared to more expensive alternatives. There's no active noise cancellation, no wireless charging support, no ability to connect to more than one device simultaneously, and no automatic pausing when you remove an earpiece. Call quality is just average, and while there <em>is</em> a "HearThrough" ambient sound mode, it generally sounds more muffled than the equivalent on higher-end pairs. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9zb3VuZGNvcmUtQWRhcHRpdmUtQ2FuY2VsbGluZy1Db21mb3J0YWJsZS1DdXN0b21pemF0aW9uL2RwL0IwQjFMVkM1Vlo_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMW0tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjY2ZmE2OWY0LWM2MDktNDY5Zi1hNDZkLTVhNTg2OTM2MmVjMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATJekwKARXlQA9Rd_nZhPZO-x2TgH-4wmlEXXNtE_XKF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fsoundcore-Adaptive-Cancelling-Comfortable-Customization%2Fdp%2FB0B1LVC5VZ">Anker's Soundcore Space A40</a> is a good budget-friendly alternative for those who want ANC and other advanced features, though it's pricier at $100.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, the Elite 3's overall package is still a strong value when it's discounted to this extent, so consider this a PSA if you're been looking for a new set of no-frills wireless earbuds without spending a ton.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>

## ‘Star Trek: Lower Decks’ finds riches in its own margins

<p>It’s been a long road, getting from <em>Lower Decks</em>’ slightly rough-around-the-edges first episode to here. But it hasn’t taken that much time, since Star Trek’s first animated sitcom very quickly found its feet to become my favorite Trek of the streaming era. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-ten-first-first-contact-130034227.html"><ins>second season</ins></a> showed a growing confidence in its own execution, and as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-three-trailer-183747278.html"><ins>third season</ins></a> concludes, we find it proud to show the world what it’s now capable of.</p><p>The clue, really, was in the swift resolution to the Pakled cliffhanger which ended the second year. On one hand, a sitcom like <em>Lower Decks</em> doesn’t need to turn into <em>The Wire</em> to keep you hooked. But it’s also aware that it can sow the seeds of a running plot thread – the story of Rutherford’s implant – into the fabric of so many episodes. And that the payoff was far more interested in the impact on the character than the cliffhanger.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And these strands certainly paid off in “Reflections,” which revealed that a person, or persons unknown, were behind Rutherford’s implant. But even that paid off in a way that you weren’t necessarily expecting it to come back here in the two-ish part finale. And who was the big bad of the season, really? Nothing more than the bete noire of so many Golden Era Trek episodes, the Evil Admiral™. I loved the show’s attempted justification for why Starfleet churns out so many of them – the lack of career development pushes people to extremes – too.</p><p>If there was a sore spot, it was that the penultimate episode, “Trusted Sources” wheeled out the hacky <em>Journalist Makes Everyone Look Awful </em>plot. It’s about as hackneyed as the one where a sitcom character has their boss over for dinner yet accidentally forgets to tell their partner. It’s only really a crowbar to get Mariner pushed out of Starfleet in preparation for the finale, and it never looked like it was going to stick given her obvious love of the Cerritos.</p><p>Naturally, the season ends with a punch-the-air victory for not just the Cerritos, but the whole California Class. I’ve always loved<em> Lower Decks’</em> celebration of the painstaking, cautious and fundamentally boring, yet fundamental, work that serving in Starfleet often requires. Its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-two-kayshon-his-eyes-open-070038927.html"><ins>regular rejection</ins></a> of the, uh, more <em>Kurtzmanesque</em> tendencies of the series makes me love it all the more. Because, like science, the best work is often slow, incremental and dull until it marks a fundamental shift in how we understand the universe. And you can’t really do that if you’re spending your whole episode running from an explosion or proving how tough you are.</p><p>Another sign of the show’s confidence is in its second crew-lite episode (I’m always a fan of a show that’ll take you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_(season_3)"><ins>elsewhere</ins></a> for an episode or two). This time, it was centered on the fate of the evil Exocomp Peanut Hamper, last seen making a run for it in the first season finale. “A Mathematically Perfect Resolution” allowed the show to both flesh out a previously one-note character, and explore a new corner of the Star Trek world.</p><p>Even better, the sparse opening act offered a lengthy showcase for Chris Westlake’s gorgeous score. Star Trek has always been about its music as much as its narrative, and the show is lucky to have both Westlake and Nami Melumad producing virtuoso work on a weekly basis. I can’t wait for a season three soundtrack album, especially since we once again hear the James Horner-parodying <em>Lower Decks</em> Action Theme several times this year.</p><p>If I have a concern, it’s that <em>Lower Decks</em> often feels like it’s designed with lasers to milk my nostalgia glands. I’ll often spend a chunk of each episode clapping like a mad seal at the latest Trek deep cut Mike McMahon and Co. throw at viewers each week. The only thing that prevents it from becoming gratuitous fanservice is that these feel mostly earned. And it has been an orgy of references, including an extended visit to Deep Space Nine.</p><p>My heart can do nothing but swell when Nana Visitor (Kira), Armin Shimmerman (Quark), JG Hertzler (Martok), Susan Gibney (Leah Brahmas) and George Takei (Captain Sulu!). And the show has the appropriate respect for Trek MVP Jeffrey Combs to bring him back for a quick visit to Agimus, still trapped in Starfleet’s filing cabinet for self-aware, megalomaniacal computers. I didn’t even mention the extended <em>First Contact</em> riff, complete with an appearance by James Cromwell, or the riff on classic TNG episode “Symbiosis” with quite possibly the darkest joke ever seen in a Trek series.</p><p>I’m running out of room to heap the usual praise on the cast, all of whom do sterling work on a regular basis. And that’s before we discuss the glorious, last-minute reveal that T’Lyn, the so-called “emotional” Vulcan from last year’s “wej Duj” has transferred to the Cerritos. (Do I want her to join Beta Shift? I have no idea, but I’m looking forward to seeing how she interacts with the gang now she’s here.)</p><p>I’m naturally very excited for <em>Lower Decks’</em> Season 4 but, by my calculations, the next time we’ll see Mariner and Boimler appear in <em>Strange New Worlds</em>. Given that we already know that Tawny Newsome and Jack Quaid <a href="https://trekmovie.com/2022/04/11/star-trek-lower-decks-cast-delights-mission-chicago-with-cosplay-and-season-3-clues/"><ins>look like their characters</ins></a>, I can’t wait to see them appear on the Enterprise bridge and stare lovingly at Pike’s Peak. My favorite nü-Trek series merging with my second-favorite? Be still my beating heart.</p>

## UN warns there's currently 'no credible pathway' to keep temperature rise under 1.5C

<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/un/"><ins>United Nations</ins></a> has issued <a href="https://www.engadget.com/we-have-three-years-to-curb-emissions-to-avoid-climate-catastrophe-un-report-finds-204058474.html"><ins>another</ins></a> stark warning that, under current policies, the planet is falling far short of the Paris Agreement goal of keeping the rise in global temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius. That's the threshold scientists say we have to remain under in order to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-08-major-un-report-climate-change-worse.html"><ins>mitigate extreme, life-threatening weather events</ins></a>, such as heatwaves, droughts and tropical storms. Under current policies, the UN suggests we're nowhere close to meeting that climate change target and that there's "no credible pathway to 1.5C in place."</p><p>The UN <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022"><ins>laid out the dire state of affairs in a report</ins></a> it released just a week before the start of the COP27 climate conference in Egypt. It said that pledges made by national policy makers since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/COP26/"><ins>COP26</ins></a>, which was held in Glasgow last year, "make a negligible difference to predicted 2030 emissions" and that progress over the last 12 months has been "highly inadequate." In fact, the report suggests that current active policies will lead to a 2.8C rise in global temperatures by the end of the 21st century and that implementing pledges that have been made will only limit the rise to between 2.4C and 2.6C. Even that would require perfect implementation of plans, with wealthier countries helping poorer ones to enact them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>"In the best case scenario, full implementation of conditional NDCs [nationally determined contributions], plus additional net zero commitments, point to a 1.8C rise," Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said. "However, this scenario is currently not credible."</p><p>The 13th edition of the Emissions Gap Report argues that major societal and infrastructure changes are required. It lays out the necessary actions for sectors including electricity supply, industry, transport and buildings, along with the food and financial systems. The report notes that, in order to get on course to meet the 1.5C goal, we'd need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a further 45 percent by 2030, compared with projections based on current policies. To limit the rise in temperatures to under 2C, an extra 30 percent reduction in emissions is required.</p><p>"Is it a tall order to transform our systems in just eight years? Yes. Can we reduce greenhouse gas emissions by so much in that timeframe? Perhaps not. But we must try," Andersen wrote. "Every fraction of a degree matters: to vulnerable communities, to species and ecosystems, and to every one of us."</p>

## The best Apple Watch accessories for 2022

<p>It didn’t take long for the Apple Watch to become perhaps the most ubiquitous wearable. Even more so than the iPhone, the Apple Watch is a device you can truly make your own with the right accessories. It is, after all, a watch, and like traditional timepieces it’s meant to reflect your personal style. While the most obvious way to customize your Apple Watch is with funky bands, there are cases, stands, wireless chargers and other accessories you can buy that can inject a bit of you into all aspects of Apple Watch ownership. We tested out a bunch of Apple Watch accessories to see which are worth your money.</p><h2>Engadget's picks</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3fJPFWc">Spigen Thin Fit case</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3IhSERS">Zagg InvisibleShield screen protector</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/35iKEBT">Anker Nano Pro 20W charger</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3fJQsq8">Apple MagSafe Duo charger</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=72705X1521812&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fportable-fast-charger-for-apple-watch%2FWIZ015btBK.html">Belkin Boost Charge Pro portable fast charger</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=72705X1521812&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbellroy.com%2Fproducts%2Ftech-kit-compact%3Fcolor%3Dblack%26material%3Dripstop_recycled%23slide-0">Bellroy Compact Tech Kit</a></p></li><li><p>Apple Watch stands</p></li><li><p>Apple Watch bands</p></li></ul><h2>Spigen Thin Fit case</h2><figure><img alt="Spigen Apple Watch case" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/0795ac40-624f-11eb-bff7-6fa0d038a5b6" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>While plenty of us use cases to protect our smartphones from drops and scrapes, you may not think to use a protective case for your smartwatch. After all, a device that’s literally strapped to your body isn’t as prone to accidental drops as a device that moves in and out of your pocket all day. Chalk it up to me being clumsy, but I’ve knocked my Apple Watch on more door frames than I’d like to admit. For less than $25, a case is a good option if you don’t want to take any chances with that $279-plus smartwatch on your wrist.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Cases” are basically bumpers that surround the edges of the Apple Watch, and some of them even cover the screen. I personally prefer a bumper-style case because, if I’m going to cover the display, it’ll be with a dedicated screen protector. Spigen’s line of Apple Watch cases are solid and they come in two different levels of bulk. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3qJ217q">Rugged Armor series</a> has a shock-absorbent layer and raised bezels, making it especially well suited for those who prioritize protection over fashion. Spigen’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3fJPFWc">Thin Fit series</a> is more my speed: It sits flush against the Watch’s display, but still gives you an extra layer of protection. You can even choose a color that matches your Watch to help it blend in. Two added perks of Spigen’s cases are that they snap on quickly and easily, and they’re quite affordable at around $14 a piece.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3fJPFWc" id="da0ea1bc2b4541d892994f57c5c70295">Buy Spigen Thin Fit at Amazon - $14</a><h2>Zagg InvisibleShield screen protector</h2><figure><img alt="Zagg Invisible Shield Screen Protector" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-02/a02c4890-90e5-11ec-9e76-0a70723c9fac" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Zagg</div></figure><p>If you don’t want the extra bulk that comes with a case, a screen protector will give you at least a bit more of a safeguard than sporting a naked Watch. Zagg’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3IhSERS">InvisibleShield line</a> is a reliable one that provides shatter protection, clarity and enhanced touch-sensitivity. When installed properly (Zagg gives you clear instructions and all the tools you need to do so), you’ll probably forget you have a screen protector on your Watch. This accessory blends in almost seamlessly with the Watch’s hardware, and if you do accidentally ding the screen, the protector should take all of  the damage.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3IhSERS" id="b7b76cdb30854c2d981c70b8a9f61337">Buy Invisible Shield screen protector at Amazon - $15</a><h2>Anker Nano Pro 20W charger</h2><figure><img alt="Anker Nano Pro charger" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-02/b2007e10-90e5-11ec-acfa-322074e3c3c2" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Anker</div></figure><p>The latest Apple Watches don’t come with power adapters, so you’ll have to dig one out of your  drawer or get a new one to charge it up. Choosing the latter is probably best since Series 7 owners will get a new, USB-C-toting cable, so you’ll need an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212769">appropriate adapter</a> to get all of that fast-charging goodness. <a href="https://amzn.to/35iKEBT">Anker’s 20W Nano Pro</a> is a good pick because it’s compact and has a few safety features built in. Inside is a dynamic temperature sensor that helps prevent overheating, plus a power tuner chip that helps adjust output based on your device. That second feature is likely more important than the first if you’re primarily using this tiny brick with your Apple Watch, but both will be handy if you ever need to use it with your iPhone. What’s more, the Nano Pro can fast charge iPhone 13s, providing a 50-percent top-up in only 25 minutes, and you can get one that matches the color of your handset if you wish.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/35iKEBT" id="3e5aaaaeabd74a039069fca84b63de61">Buy Anker Nano Pro 20W at Amazon - $18</a><h2>Apple MagSafe Duo charger</h2><figure><img alt="Apple MagSafe Duo charger" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-02/bfe10b30-90e5-11ec-b76f-6953800cc22c" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Apple makes one of the more elegant solutions to charging your iPhone and Apple Watch while traveling.

Those who travel or commute often should consider getting a second Apple Watch charger, that way you’re not stuck if you forget to pack your one and only before a long weekend trip. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=72705X1521812&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fportable-fast-charger-for-apple-watch%2FWIZ015btBK.html">Belkin’s Boost Charge Pro portable fast charger</a> is a great option, particularly for those who have a Series 7. The square pad uses Apple’s new fast wireless-charging module, so it’ll be able to power up the Series 7 from 0 to 80 percent in roughly 45 minutes.</p><p>You can simply sit your timepiece on the module to charge, but it also flips up so you can use the Watch in Nightstand mode while it’s powering up on your bedside table. To support different Watch sizes and protective cases, the pad also has a dial on its underside that lets you adjust the height of the charging module. Plus, the attached USB-C cable that tucks away on the bottom of the pad is four feet long, giving you a bit more placement flexibility than other chargers.</p><p>The main drawback is its $60 list price, but those strapped for cash should consider <a href="https://amzn.to/3KPKl27">Anker’s version</a>, which is very similar to Belkins and only $43. It won’t fast-charge the Series 7, but it will power up the device just like it would a Series 6 or earlier. I also prefer how the attached USB-C cable coils up into the base on this one – it’s a bit neater than Belkin’s solution.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=72705X1521812&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fportable-fast-charger-for-apple-watch%2FWIZ015btBK.html" id="cfc8d994d281441d913f37d636e8bae4">Buy Boost Charge Pro at Belkin - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3KPKl27" id="57f351080bf74ff38711b0777dbe8103">Buy Anker Foldable Charging Dock at Amazon - $43</a><h2>Bellroy Compact Tech Kit</h2><figure><img alt="Bellroy Compact Tech Kit" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-02/29b7e1b0-90e5-11ec-bf50-6d5e68b5eda8" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bellroy</div></figure><p>You’ll likely have your Apple Watch strapped to your wrist while traveling, but it’s a good idea to have a pouch or case that can hold the gadget along with any accessories you need when you’re not wearing it. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=72705X1521812&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbellroy.com%2Fproducts%2Ftech-kit-compact%3Fcolor%3Dblack%26material%3Dripstop_recycled%23slide-0">Bellroy’s Compact Tech Kit</a> is an attractive option not only because of its minimalist design, but the multiple loops and pockets on the inside.

My Watch often topples over or rolls about when I simply trust it to sit on its side next to my bed, but that’s easily fixed with a stand. Elago’s stands may be simple, but they have a lot of personality, coming in colorful <a href="https://amzn.to/3nFHnDm">dome shapes</a> and in the forms of <a href="https://amzn.to/32h12BS">retro tech</a>. The biggest problem with them, particularly the dome stands, is that they can be prone to sliding around on your desk or nightstand if there’s any tension on your charging cable. But they hold the Apple Watch well and, at under $15, they’re affordable ways to inject more personality into your accessory game.</p><p>We previously recommended <a href="https://amzn.to/33Tj2ma">Spigen’s $12 S350 charging stand</a> as another basic option, but we’d now opt to upgrade to the <a href="https://amzn.to/3tRDu1N">PowerArc ArcField wireless charger</a>. Coming in at $50, this one looks almost identical to the S350 stand but it comes with an Apple Watch charging module built in, plus an attached, 6.6-foot USB-C cable. It also comes with a few rubber pads of different heights, allowing you to adjust the stand to the right height based on your Watch’s size and if you have a case protecting it. While it costs more than a standard silicone charging stand for your Apple Watch, it’s worth it for the additional charging power – plus if it does become your main home charger, that frees up the charging cable that came with the Apple Watch to be your on-the-go option.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3nFHnDm" id="08092c7151c14471947258e7ef53d574">Buy Elago dome charging stand at Amazon - $10</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/32h12BS" id="07b94edfba7a4090b91e7942f09963be">Buy Elago W6 charging stand (iPod) at Amazon - $15</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3tRDu1N" id="ae8c04cd5b524870822d6db14939f8e2">Buy Spigen PowerArc ArcField wireless charger at Amazon - $50</a><h2>Apple Watch bands</h2><figure><img alt="Apple Watch bands" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/d3df4cd0-624e-11eb-b6fb-398a0832a871" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>You probably made your way to this guide because you are an Apple Watch owner and want to deck it out. But if you haven’t made the purchase yet, consider using the Apple Watch Studio to customize the timepiece's watch band to your liking. Doing so will let you choose the precise band style and color you want, and there are definitely a few that are worth getting directly from Apple. Both the Sport Band and the Sport Loop are good basic strap options for everyday and exercise use, but you can find alternatives for much less elsewhere.</p><p>Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch/solo-loop">Solo Loop</a> is a good one if you just want to slip your Watch on in the morning without worrying about notches or buckles — just make sure you get the right size when you order. I’m also partial to the Nike Sport Band because its carefully placed holes make it breathable and extra comfortable for working out. But if you want that one, you’ll have to buy the Apple Watch Nike edition, which is just a regular Watch with the Nike+ Run Club app preinstalled.</p><p>But if you or your loved one already have an Apple Watch, it’s easy to find additional bands, from leather to stainless steel, across the web. When it comes to basic silicone straps, you can find <a href="https://amzn.to/3qJ4AX5">packs of three to six bands</a> for less than $20 but the quality may be questionable. Look for brands with many high ratings on Amazon if you insist on getting the best bang for your buck. You can also use FakeSpot’s Amazon integration to get an idea for how trustworthy a product’s reviews are.</p><p>A few reputable brands that make Apple Watch bands are Spigen, Elago and Casetify. <a href="https://amzn.to/3IJmTkY">Spigen’s Silicone Fit band</a> feels the most similar to Apple’s Sport Band. The strap material is soft, comfortable and it’s a hair thinner than Apple’s watch strap. The biggest difference is that you’ll pay around $10 for one of Spigen’s bands as opposed to $50 for one of Apple’s.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3qJ4AX5" id="67d1059a12d24d1992e4a98a9a56cbb5">Buy Apple Watch bands (5 pack) at Amazon - $20</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3IJmTkY" id="7dfdad785b3640b4aca3c52638a76483">Buy Spigen Silicone Fit band at Amazon - $7</a><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3Ak0mbm">Elago’s Sport Bands</a> are made of fluoro-rubber material, so they’re a bit thicker and more substantial than Apple’s standard silicone watch band.

They are a good option if you like the simplicity of Apple’s own bands but don’t want to shell out $50 for one.</p><p>Casetify occupies the opposite end of the spectrum, offering printed and customizable Apple Watch straps that truly stand out. They come in metal, leather, silicone and recycled plastic and you can get as specific as you want. There are plenty of solid colors to choose from as well as dozens of floral and animal prints. Casetify also has trendy collaborations with <a href="https://casetify.hyyc7q.net/x9manA">Disney</a>, Netflix’s <a href="https://casetify.hyyc7q.net/mgaqne"><em>Squid Game</em></a> and other pop-culture heavyweights, and even bands you can <a href="https://casetify.hyyc7q.net/P0AEKz">personalize</a> with your recipient’s name or initials.

<p>It took <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-director-mode-for-creators-165506037.html">several months</a>, but Snap's promised video editing suite is finally available. The social network is now rolling out "Director Mode" to all Snapchat users on Android and iOS. As teased in April, the feature lets creators add polish to their Snaps with virtual green screens, camera speed changes and quick editing for multiple clips.</p><p>You can also use the BeReal-style <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-dual-camera-130029031.html">Dual Camera</a> functionality within this mode, although it's currently limited to iOS users. Android users will have "limited" access to two-camera recording in the weeks ahead. Dual Camera is also available through the regular Snapchat cam.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Director Mode will be useful for influencers who want to produce videos for Spotlight, Snapchat's home for TikTok-like short videos. It may be particularly helpful for verified users (Snap Stars in company lingo) who want more of the sheen they apply to all their online content.</p><p>Snap isn't alone in chasing after TikTok and similar rivals. Instagram has been testing a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-bereal-candid-challenges-232117658.html">Candid Challenges</a> feature that mimics BeReal, and it's no secret that social media heavyweights have routinely lifted elements from each other in a bid to remain competitive — to the point where they've occasionally had to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-full-screen-feed-recommended-posts-185859342.html">walk back their plans</a> after mimicking designs too closely.

But job cuts were going to happen even if Musk completely backed out of purchasing the website anyway.

## DOJ reportedly investigating Tesla’s Autopilot self-driving claims after crashes

<p>The Department of Justice is reportedly investigating whether Tesla has misled customers and investors by claiming that its Autopilot technology enables full-fledged self-driving capabilities. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/exclusive-tesla-faces-us-criminal-probe-over-self-driving-claims-sources-2022-10-26/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the DOJ launched the probe last year following over a dozen crashes, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-jury-trial-crash-miami-210510480.html">fatal ones,</a> in which Autopilot was activated. Prosecutors in Washington and San Francisco are examining if Tesla had made unsupported full self-driving claims about the technology, and they could ultimately pursue criminal charges or seek sanctions. But they could also shut the probe down without doing anything if they determine that Tesla hasn't done anything wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in August, reports came out that the California DMV had filed complaints against the automaker with the California Office of Administrative Hearings. The state's DMV had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-dmv-accuses-tesla-false-advertising-130350292.html">accused</a> Tesla of using advertising language on its website for its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving products that aren't based on facts and made it seem like its vehicles are capable of fully driverless trips. One example is part of the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/en_AE/autopilot">Autopilot page on Tesla's website</a> that says "All you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go." In the same page, there's a video that starts with a note that reads "The person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons. He isn't doing anything. The car is driving itself."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But at the same time, Tesla <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot">explicitly states</a> in its support page that "Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability are intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel." Those currently enabled features, the company added, "do not make the vehicle autonomous." Its sources told <em>Reuters</em> that Tesla's warnings that drivers should keep their hands on the wheel could complicate any case the DOJ may bring.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from the Justice Department, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is also looking into Tesla's Autopilot system. The agency <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-investigation-nhtsa-141310451.html">initiated a probe</a> in 2021 following the report of 11 crashes with parked first responder vehicles since 2018. Those crashes results in 17 injuries and one death. In June this year, the NHTSA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nhtsa-expands-probe-tesla-collisions-stationary-emergency-vehicles-093514999.html">upgraded the probe's status</a> and expanded it to cover almost all Tesla vehicles sold since 2014.</p>

<p>Duolingo Math is now available on iOS, over a year since it was first teased. Naturally, the new math app feels a lot like the company’s language app, including colorful animations and interactive exercises all built into gamified lessons.</p><p>There are two main components to the app: an elementary-level math curriculum that goes over classroom topics and a brain-training course aimed at adults, with a focus on improving mental math skills. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-11-nintendo-brain-training-europe.html">Dr. Kawashima has a lot to answer for</a>. For those anxious about their math skills, it could be a subtle way of brushing up on those multiplication skills. Sadly, mental arithmetic remains not quite as dreamy as learning a second language.</p><p>Duolingo’s reputation should help it stand out in a sea of similar apps, and like many rivals, Duolingo Math is free. The app is available on iPhone and iPad, only in English for now. No word yet on when it will be available on Android.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonywireless-earbuds-multipoint-support-133022238.html">Sony's wireless earbuds will support multipoint connections this fall</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-icloud-web-beta-194116973.html">Apple's new iCloud web interface is much more useful than before</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-2022-the-frame-smart-t-vs-are-cheaper-than-ever-right-now-191530377.html">Samsung's 2022 The Frame smart TVs are cheaper than ever right now</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/om-5-micro-four-thirds-mirrorless-camera-081056375.html">OM System unveils the OM-5, its first camera without the Olympus name</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-retro-controllers-iphone-ipad-apple-tv-mac-091843674.html">Nintendo's retro controllers now work on iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and Mac</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-witcher-remake-unreal-engine-5-cd-projekt-red-fools-theory-151043035.html">'The Witcher' is getting an Unreal Engine 5 remake</a></p></li></ul><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/starlink-rv-works-on-moving-vehicles-113342022.html https://www.engadget.com/...">SpaceX's pricier Starlink internet service for RVs now works on moving vehicles</a></h2><h3>You'll have to pay $2,500 upfront for the hardware.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/starlink-rv-works-on-moving-vehicles-113342022.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><figure><img alt="TMA" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/11c37930-55dd-11ed-bf7d-805f5d0abc52" style="height: 450; width: 675;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Getty</div></figure></a><p>SpaceX has launched a new variant of Starlink for RVs called "Flat High Performance" that you can use on moving vehicles.

## Apple pulls gambling ads from App Store product pages following backlash
 - [https://www.engadget.com/apple-pulls-gambling-ads-from-app-store-product-pages-082207219.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/apple-pulls-gambling-ads-from-app-store-product-pages-082207219.html?src=rss)

<p>On October 25th, Apple started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-app-store-today-tab-ads-152249659.html">displaying more ads</a> in the App Store, particularly in the "Today" tab and at the bottom of app listings. Since then, multiple developers have complained about getting ads for gambling under their listings' "You Might Also Like" section, when they have nothing to do with their applications. One of those developers was Marco Arment, who posted a screenshot on Twitter showing gambling advertisements on the App Store page for his podcast app Overcast. Other developers reported having the same issue and made it clear that they weren't OK with casino ads in their product pages. Now, Apple has told <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/26/app-store-gambling-ads-complaints/"><em>MacRumors</em></a> that it has "paused ads related to gambling and a few other categories on App Store product pages."</p><div id="1051748ad5fa4389b4e68b031e05b60c"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Now my app’s product page shows gambling ads, which I’m really not OK with.<br /><br />Apple shouldn’t be OK with it, either.<br /><br />The App Store has corrupted such a great company so deeply. They make so much from gambling and manipulative IAPs that they don’t even see the problem anymore. <a href="https://t.co/MnNlf7k0kT">https://t.co/MnNlf7k0kT</a></p>— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1585054271627837441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>That's pretty much Apple's whole statement. It's not quite clear if the tech giant intends to resume serving gambling ads after the backlash dies down — Apple didn't expound on its decision, and the word "pause" seems to suggest that the change is only temporary. As <em>MacRumors</em> notes, people have been <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1585063085471047681">criticizing</a> Apple for serving casino ads as a whole and not just because they're being served within app listings. Florian Mueller of the <em>FOSS Patents</em> blog also <a href="https://twitter.com/FOSSpatents/status/1583508593193603072">argued</a> that by putting ads in app pages, Apple is forcing developers to pony up money to buy those ad spaces. That's because if they don't purchase them, competitors could use them and take potential customers away.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple has sold ads in the App Store for years, but the ads space in the Today tab used to be reserved for a curated list of recommendations from Apple's editorial team. Meanwhile, the "You Might Also Like" section where ads are now displayed at the bottom of listings contained suggestion cards for similar apps. Since Apple allows advertisers to target categories different than their own, though, casino ads can show up just about anywhere on the App Store.&nbsp;</p>

## Samsung posts a 23 percent profit decline due to weak demand

<p>Samsung has reported a record consolidated revenue of 76.78 trillion Korean won (US$54 billion) for the third quarter of 2022, but it has also <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-third-quarter-2022-results?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=direct">posted a decline in profit</a> from the previous quarter and year-over-year. The tech giant's operating profit (KRW 10.85 trillion or US$7.6 billion) has declined 23 percent from the second quarter and around 31.4 percent from the same period last year. Samsung's operating profit from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-q3-earnings-chip-mobile-record-high-030342880.html">July to September 2021</a> was KRW 15.82 trillion, which was 26 percent higher than the quarter prior to that. In its earnings report, the company said its various divisions have been grappling with weak demand in the midst of global economic instability.&nbsp;</p><p>Weak demand for consumer products and customers' inventory adjustments caused its Memory business' earnings to shrink. Its LSI business' earnings fell due to weak demand for phones and TVs, as well, though revenue from SoCs grew due to an increased portion of 5G. Samsung's Visual Display Business was also affected by low demand and increased costs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung's Mobile eXperience (MX) business was its bright spot last quarter. Together with the company's Networks business, it posted KRW 32.21 trillion (US$22.6 billion) in consolidated revenue and KRW 3.24 trillion (US$2.27 billion) in operating profit, which are both higher than the previous quarter's. The company attributes the MX business' success to sales of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review-specs-price-a-flagship-foldable-refined-131543810.html">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review-camera-samples-specs-price-battery-life-170027529.html">Z Flip 4</a>, both of which showed stronger growth than their predecessors. Further, the Galaxy S22 series was able to maintain "solid sales momentum."&nbsp;</p><p>The tech giant expects its mobile business to perform even better in the fourth quarter as demand for smartphones and wearables increases due to year-end seasonality. And since the smartphone and wearable markets are expected to grow as a whole next year, Samsung's mobile business might continue bringing in solid profits. Another division that did well in the third quarter is the tech giant's Foundry business, which delivered record earnings (KRW 23.02 trillion or US$16 billion in consolidated revenue and KRW 5.12 trillion or US$3.6 billion in operating profit) thanks to solid demand from global customers.</p><p>On the same day that it released its third quarter earnings, Samsung has also formally named Jay Y. Lee as its executive chairman. It's mostly a symbolic move, seeing as Lee is the company's de-facto leader anyway. But as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-27/samsung-heir-lee-formally-takes-helm-of-technology-empire?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> notes, the title could help make things smoother for Lee as he closes deals with other companies around the world in an effort to expand Samsung's semiconductor and biotechnology businesses. Lee, who was sentenced to five years in prison in 2017 after being found guilty of bribing public officials, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-heir-jay-y-lee-gets-a-presidential-pardon-094026021.html">received a presidential pardon</a> in August so he could help South Korea overcome the economic crisis.&nbsp;</p>
