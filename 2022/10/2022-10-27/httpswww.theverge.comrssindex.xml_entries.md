The company also shook up the App Store with new rules and ad slots designed to wring more money out of its tight grip over the iOS ecosystem.

And as developers have found in the past, they don’t have much room to push back.</p>

  <p id="MwoghX">Who knew left-hand turns were so dangerous? Well, anyone who drives in a city, like an Uber driver, for example, has probably encountered their fair share of dangerous left turns. <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/811366">According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>, 22 percent of crashes involve a vehicle making a left turn at an intersection. Uber has a novel solution to this problem: fewer left turns.</p>
<p id="QfZ5En">Uber announced today that its in-app navigation system will now recommend fewer left turns in an effort to reduce crashes and make trips safer overall. The adjustments are expected to be “minor” with little impact on trip time, but the effect will hopefully make for a less stressful experience for drivers. </p>

But we do know who’s consistently responsible for huge amounts of methane pollution. Every year, the oil and gas industry leaks tremendous amounts of methane.

Specifically, the suit claims that Shipt misrepresents the nature of a delivery driver’s work, suggesting that the worker acts as their “own boss.” But in reality, drivers are required to sign up for hourly shifts, and the amount of money they make depends on the number of orders placed within that timeframe.

<p id="gUToT3">“Keystone was the codename of something we were incubating internally, which was ... a streaming console, so there’s no local gameplay, low-cost, plug it into a TV, and you’d be able to stream Xbox games,” said Spencer. “In the late spring, we pivoted to working with Samsung. We put an app on Samsung TVs that let you play Xbox games, and I still have the prototype; it sits on the shelf behind my computer.”</p>

  <p id="27NC1B">Physical copies of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em> are starting to be delivered worldwide, and players have been stunned to find the discs only include 72MB of data. Instead, owners have had to download the entire game digitally, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modern-warfare-2s-disc-has-a-whopping-70mb-of-data"><em>Eurogamer </em>reports</a> could take up as much as 150GB of space on the PS5.</p>
<p id="R1KnDH">Activision has effectively shipped a dummy disc, meaning physical copies of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II </em>will always have to connect up to the internet to get a copy of the game. It’s a process that has seen widespread criticism in the past, particularly because it can hinder game preservation, force firmware updates, and overall, pushes owners toward DRM versions of games that might not work properly years in the future.</p>

  <p id="Qi8OOU">Snapchat is giving users more powerful video tools through a new feature called Director Mode. It’s available starting today globally for iOS and Android.</p>
<p id="oU9Ld4">Director Mode, first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGcd0jctFg">previewed</a> in April, brings a handful of new features for filming and editing videos on Snapchat, including a few that are popular on other platforms. Green screen, for example, allows users to record videos with a background, similar to the TikTok filter of the same name. And dual camera, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/29/23326795/snapchat-dual-camera-mode-bereal">previously</a> only available for iOS users, is a BeReal-esque feature that takes a front and back-facing photo or video simultaneously.</p>
<p id="uQRjks">Other tools include quick edit, which allows users to trim and splice multiple videos together, and a camera speed feature to speed up or slow down...</p>

## Boost Mobile’s new no-fee banking comes with a surprising number of fees

  <p id="0Sxj4Q">Dish Network-owned Boost Mobile is getting into financial services with the launch of <a href="https://www.myomnimoney.com/">OmniMoney</a>, a basic banking service aimed at people who can’t access traditional bank accounts. It’s a service that Boost CEO Stephen Stokols hopes will make the brand “stickier to existing customers” and attract new ones. This comes at a time when the company very much needs to attract new customers, as the Boost brand <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/dish-prefers-keep-boost-now-ergen">continues to lose subscribers</a> and Dish is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/27/23373064/dish-project-genesis-5g-accounts-service">struggling to get a viable 5G network</a> off the ground. At least part of that plan includes offering “basic no-fee banking services” — except, well, there are fees.</p>
<p id="EoSX5b">To be clear, Boost Mobile is not becoming a bank. It’s licensing the service from <a href="https://alviere.com/">a company called Alviere</a>, which handles the banking...</p>

## This tablet pairs an E Ink display with a...  16-megapixel rear camera?

  <p id="H6qBk0">The Boox Tab Ultra is a new $599.99 E Ink tablet from Onyx that pairs a 16-megapixel rear camera with a 10.3-inch paper-link display. It’s an odd combination. Tablets already have a bit of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/16/6990649/apples-ipad-air-2-shows-that-tablet-photography-is-here-to-stay">rough reputation when it comes to photography</a>, and E Ink displays aren’t exactly known for their color accuracy or high refresh rates — two features that are pretty important when it comes to taking good photos. So what’s going on here?</p>
<p id="QlQj7h">The truth is a lot more sensible than it initially seems. Onyx is pitching the Boox Tab Ultra as a device for professional and business usage, where it thinks a rear camera might be helpful for scanning documents with support for OCR. “Turn on the rear camera to take a picture of your document and convert it to text...</p>
