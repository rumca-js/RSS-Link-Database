Kevin Bacon?", "date_published": "2022-10-25 21:24:02+00:00", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32001674&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C118%2C0%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>Five minutes have passed. This makes it time for Disney+ to announce another Marvel TV show, <em>The Guardians of the Galaxy Christmas Special</em>. I've fallen off with the MCU as of late. Nothing they've put out over the past few years (save for <em>Spider-Man</em>) looks good or the least bit interesting. But I've always enjoyed <em>The Guardians</em> movies. Unlike everything else Marvel, they exist as their own stories and not just to set up other movies that set up other movies.</p><p>The first trailer has been released. It looks... okay-ish.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Kevin Bacon enters the MCU canon in the first teaser for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GuardiansoftheGalaxy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GuardiansoftheGalaxy</a> Holiday Special <a href=\"https://t.co/3H7CKyKusF\">pic.twitter.com/3H7CKyKusF</a><br />\u2014 The Hollywood Reporter (@THR) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/THR/status/1584977573422911489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 25, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>It is 5:13 PM eastern as I write that and as of this very moment, there has NOT been a Cancel Chris Pratt \"trend\" on Twitter. This one seems like no-brainer. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-nine-rules-life\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Pratt</a> + <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/santa-claus-car-thief-takedown\" target=\"_blank\">Christmas</a> = <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-james-gunn-thor\" target=\"_blank\">attack Pratt for being a Christian</a>. We'll see what tomorrow brings.</p><p>The trailer looks like every Christmas story ever told that doesn't involve Jesus. Someone is sad and doesn't have the Christmas spirit. So their friends try to do something nice for them. In this case, it means traveling to Earth to kidnap Kevin Bacon as a Christmas present for Starlord. </p><p>That's not a spoiler. It's the focal point of the trailer. Kevin Bacon playing Kevin Bacon. It's the elusive one degree of Kevin Bacon movie.</p><p>My biggest issue with the trailer is it looks like the story revolves around two characters: Drax and Mantis. Is this a Guardians of the Galaxy special? Or is it a Drax and Mantis special, because everyone else was busy making other movies and could barely squeeze in a cameo?</p><p>We'll find out on Black Friday. The special debuts on November 25th.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

They sent the billionaire an open letter <a href=\"https://time.com/6224380/elon-musk-twitter-open-letter/\" target=\"_blank\">reviewed by <em>Time Magazine</em></a>. Some choice cuts:</p><blockquote>Elon Musk\u2019s plan to lay off 75% of Twitter workers will hurt Twitter\u2019s ability to serve the public conversation. A threat of this magnitude is reckless, undermines our users\u2019 and customers\u2019 trust in our platform<br /></blockquote><p>There <em>is no</em> trust in the platform. You, the undersigned Twitter workers, are responsible for that. Hence 75% of you being wished well in your future endeavors.</p><blockquote>We demand leadership to respect the platform and the workers who maintain it by committing to preserving the current headcount.</blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"75685\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32000919&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<blockquote>We demand that leadership does not discriminate against workers on the basis of their race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, <strong>or political beliefs</strong>. </blockquote><p>Emphasis mine. Because the people working at Twitter are all about discriminating over political beliefs. Providing, natch, those beliefs are different from the employees of Twitter. </p><blockquote>We demand to be treated with dignity, and to not be treated as mere pawns in a game played by billionaires.</blockquote><p>Elon Musk is no dummy. He knows that discretion is the better part of... you know, the thing. I'm sure if he chooses to respond to this letter, it will be with tact and decorum.

On Friday, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/taylor-swift-nyu-commencement-address\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Taylor Swift Ph.D.</a> dropped <em>Midnights</em>. There were lots of tears.

Instead of leaving it with three idiots having the same dumb opinion, they quoted an \"expert.\"</p><blockquote>Taylor saying that her worst nightmares or intrusive thoughts is the scale saying she is fat is incredibly damaging to actual fat people. She's saying, 'I feel terrible when my body feels the way your body is.'

I feel dumber for having written that sentence. Almost as dumb as I felt writing the post six years ago.</p><p>\"Anti-Hero\" is about Taylor dealing with her insecurities. One of them is having the constant worry about how she has to look at all times in fear of haters lashing out. Haters lashed out anyway. So to the fat-rights activists crying over five seconds in a music video, I say:<em> It's you. Hi. You're the problem. It's you. </em></p><p>And while many consider \"Anti-Hero\" to be the best song on the new album, it hardly cracks her Top 5 of all time. It's no \"State of Grace\" or \"Ours.\"</p><p>You all need to calm down.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

I can't say we were the first. It's an easy two words to put together and a reference to what liberal media called disgraced governor Andrew Cuomo. But we were, if nothing else, <em>among</em> the first. Now it's common to refer to DeSantis as America's Governor. And he's taken note.</p><p>DeSantis mentioned how he is sometimes referred to as \"America's Governor\" while singing the praises of what an amazing first lady <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/casey-desantis-wears-green-dress\" target=\"_blank\">Casey DeSantis</a> is for the Sunshine State.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n<span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>\n<small class=\"image-media media-caption\">DeSantis: 'People Will Sometimes Refer To Me As America's Governor'</small>\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/XQMs1P6pdqQ\" target=\"_blank\">youtu.be</a>\n</small>\n</p><blockquote>You know people will sometimes refer to me as America's Governor, but I can tell you this Florida is blessed to have the best first lady in all 50 states.</blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"56b0f\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=31999210&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>He followed up with, and I'm sure this is a mere coincidence, what separates Florida -- the state he is the <strong>GOVERNOR</strong> of -- from every other state in <strong>AMERICA</strong>.</p><blockquote>One of the things that separated Florida from some of the other states over the last few years is we did the right thing, but we did the right things when it wasn't easy. I think if you look at what really separates somebody who's just the typical politician for somebody that can actually be a leader and actually deliver big results is courage. You got to have the courage of your convictions. You got to be willing to stand strong you got to be willing to show backbone.</blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"3f408\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=31999215&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>\"America's Governor\" can sometimes be used as a reference to rumors DeSantis is, God willing, considering a run for president. He addressed those rumors during Monday night's Florida Gubernatorial Debate. Whatshisface with the hair demanded DeSantis pledge not to run for president. DeSantis didn't say yes or no.

She addressed her suspension from CNN. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cnn-toobin-katherine-ham\" target=\"_blank\">Her suspension from CNN... that CNN never told her about</a>. She only found out she was suspended from CNN when CNN called her and said \"good news, your suspension has been lifted.\"</p><p>Dig a little deeper, you find out she was suspended for getting into it on Twitter <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/online/mary-katharine-ham-unloads-on-her-own-network-in-unflinching-rant/\" target=\"_blank\">with another CNN employee</a> over how the network dealt with Jeffrey Toobin <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/oj-simpson-jeffrey-toobin\" target=\"_blank\">whipping it out and playing with himself on a Zoom call</a>. Dig even deeper, you find out her suspension was seven months while Toobin's was eight. So the difference between jerking off in front of co-workers and criticizing someone jerking off in front of co-workers? One month. This is CNN. They handled Toobin more gently than he handled himself.</p><p>Megyn Kelly, a connoisseur of exposing liberal media hypocrisy herself, had MKH on to discuss further.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\"I reject that this is the one penis I'm not allowed to talk about...\"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mkhammer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@mkhammer</a> on the political violence double standard that led to her Jeffrey Toobin-related CNN suspension.

My bad.</p><p>While unspoken, I'm sure Toobin <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jeffrey-toobin-constitution-political-document\" target=\"_blank\">having the \"right\" political opinion</a> and MKH <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/angry-parent-explains-mad\" target=\"_blank\">having the \"wrong\" political opinion</a> factored into CNN's decision while doling out punishments.  The bigger issue is the much more gross hypocrisy, that Mary Katherine was rather blunt about.</p><blockquote>As a woman in media, I have been asked to comment on every errant penis in the media industry -- and there were so many -- for the past five years,  sometimes at the exclusion of all the other things I'd like to talk about like tax policy, health policy, and foreign policy. And yet I do it because it's the right thing to do, even though it can be a little humiliating to be on TV talking about nothing but errant penises of your colleagues. I reject that this is the one penis that I'm not allowed to talk about. I reject it.</blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f22bc\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=31999116&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>Lesson learned. While it is inadvisable for any man in media to play with his schlong in front of coworkers (yes, even on a Zoom call), if you're going to get away with it you need to have the correct political opinions. If you are a woman who takes issue with it, especially one with the wrong political opinions, you best keep quiet about it unless you want to develop a reputation.</p><p>As a side note, there is one thing in the entire Toobin's wiener brouhaha I can't figure out... who the hell gets that turned on by conference calls? Any conference call I've ever been stuck on, all I can think of is how much I hate my life.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

Well, maybe not all eyes. A few more than usual. People wanted to know if Corden was going to address <em>BeingADoucheToRestaurantServersGate</em>. If you missed it, the owner of a <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-corden-moves-audience-members\" target=\"_blank\">fancy schmancy eatery in New York City banned him</a> over the (alleged) terrible way he treated the middle-class employees working there. </p><p>Corden DID in fact address the matter.

When Corden lashed out about the controversy to the <em>New York Times</em>, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-corden-beneath-him\" target=\"_blank\">claiming he did nothing wrong and that it was beneath him</a>, he said he *may\" address the matter. As Corden said on Monday's show, he adopts a, quote, \"British attitude\" about things where you \"never complain\" and \"never explain.\" But his dad told him he f*cked up, so Corden addressed the matter.</p><blockquote>In the heat of the moment, I made a sarcastic rude comment about cooking it myself.

But, turns out it was a big deal to the server he was a jerk to. The controversy affected Corden personally because he too used to work in a restaurant.  </p><blockquote>I understand the difficulties of being a server. I worked shifts at restaurants for years. I have such respect, and I value anyone that does such a job.</blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d19c0\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=31998980&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>So, that's that and we can all put the ordeal behind us!</p><p>You knew Corden needed to address the issue. Once the controversy erupted, the internet did internet things. Corden was being \"Ellen Degeneres'd\" with people digging up every nasty thing he has allegedly ever done. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-corden-restaurant\" target=\"_blank\">Like fat-shaming audience members</a>, which is... ironic. But that's all hearsay. Let's focus on one issue at a time.</p><p>James Corden is sorry for being a jerk. He's going to apologize in person.
