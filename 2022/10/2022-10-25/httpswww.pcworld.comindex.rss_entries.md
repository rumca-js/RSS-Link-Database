<p>After news of the meltdowns made the rounds, an AMD executive made a surprisingly specific revelation about the upcoming RDNA 3 series graphics cards: They won&rsquo;t be using the next-gen power connection. </p>



<p>The confirmation comes from AMD&rsquo;s Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Radeon brand, Scott Herkelman. On Twitter, Herkelman replied directly to a conversation about the Nvidia power connection issues and confirmed the upcoming Radeon designs won&rsquo;t use the 12VHPWR connection. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Radeon RX 6000 series and upcoming RDNA 3 GPUs will not use this power connector.</p>&mdash; Scott Herkelman (@sherkelman) <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/sherkelman/status/1584931430483705859?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-1-1361668-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">October 25, 2022</a></blockquote></div></figure><p>It&rsquo;s a surprisingly concrete and technical statement about an upcoming GPU design, still more than a week out from <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1070995/amd-sets-its-next-gen-radeon-reveal-for-november.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">its announcement on November 3rd</a>. And to play devil&rsquo;s advocate, it&rsquo;s unlikely that Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 4090 issues played a part in AMD&rsquo;s decision&mdash;it&rsquo;s simply too late in the design process for AMD to switch course. The only other solid info that AMD has given out is that it&rsquo;s focusing on efficiency rather than raw power, possibly a smart move considering the pushback Nvidia has gotten for its price increases. </p>

## Multiple RTX 4090 owners report melting 12VHPWR power cables

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Nvidia&rsquo;s latest graphics cards are absolute monsters, both in terms of size and power draw. In fact the ferocious GeForce RTX 4090 uses the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/631851/atx-3-0-explained-why-intel-gave-power-supplies-their-first-overhaul-in-20-years.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">brand new 12VHPWR 16-pin power rail design</a>, featured on ATX 3.0 power supplies. Most people don&rsquo;t have those new breed ATX 3.0 PSUs, however, so Nvidia included a 12VHPWR to 4x 8-pin adapter in the box for use with traditional power supplies. But on a small number of units, those fancy new high-wattage rails and connections seem to be causing problems with the power connection. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/631851/atx-3-0-explained-why-intel-gave-power-supplies-their-first-overhaul-in-20-years.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Two separate Reddit users</a> show the new ATX 3.0 rail failing, melting the plastic around the connector. </p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/25/23422349/nvidia-rtx-4090-power-cables-connectors-melting-burning&amp;xcust=2-1-1361471-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Speaking to The Verge</a>, an Nvidia spokesperson said the company is investigating both incidents, contacting one user and reaching out to another. Exactly what&rsquo;s happened isn&rsquo;t immediately clear. Some are speculating that the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">new, tighter configuration of the power connection</a> is causing the internal pins to be bent, or that tight quarters inside a desktop PC case necessitate bending the cables in an awkward direction. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Cablemod 12VHPWR illustration" class="wp-image-1361507" height="301" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/atx3-power-cable-bend.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">CableMod</p></div>



<p>Since its introduction, several sources have raised concerns about the new 12VHPWR connector design, which can handle up to 600 watts of power. (The RTX 4090 tops out at 450w.) CableMod explicitly warns buyers of the cable <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://cablemod.com/12vhpwr/&amp;xcust=2-1-1361471-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">not to bend it vertically or horizontally</a> closer than 35mm to the connection head, as doing so could loosen or misalign the power pins and create an uneven load. </p>



<p>YouTuber Actual Hardcore Overclocking has an excellent explanation of some of the weaker aspects of the new cable connection design, and where it might be failing under the wrong conditions. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure><p>It should be noted that at the time of writing, both Reddit posters were using the 4-head, 32-pin adapter designed to let the new cards work with older power supplies, so it could be an issue with the adapter and not the 12VHPWR as a whole. The RTX 4080, which will be released in mid-November, uses the same 12VHPWR connection and includes the same adapter cable. </p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>The smaller and more versatile USB-C ports are becoming the new standard in laptops. This is great for making thinner and lighter-weight laptops, but how do you connect all of your old USB-A peripherals like your mouse and keyboard? Enter a USB-C hub. By connecting a hub to your USB-C port on your laptop, you open up a world of connectivity. Hubs allow you to not only connect your USB-A peripherals, but also your HDMI connections, SD cards, or they simply just add more USB ports.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s no shortage of USB-C hubs featuring a whole range of combinations of modern and legacy ports, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem to find the right hub for your needs.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve tested numerous USB-C hubs and compiled a list of our favorites. We discuss not only the port options available with each hub, but also lesser known details you won&rsquo;t find from the manufacturer&rsquo;s description, such as whether there is adequate space between the ports or if the hub runs hot during use. You can also check out our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3596491/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">recommendations for the best Thunderbolt docks</a>&mdash;essentially an upgraded version of a USB-C hub. We explain those differences as part of our buying advice, which you&rsquo;ll find below our product recommendations.</p>

In this example, the left port is used for charging, so you&rsquo;d need to buy a USB-C hub with a charging input to use with this slot. (Of course, you could also buy a hub&nbsp;<em>without</em> charging capabilities and use it in the other USB-C port, to the right of the charging port.)</p>

<p>Can a USB-C hub feel elegant? This one does. Anker&rsquo;s 7-in-1 USB-C hub feels surprisingly weighty (3.5 ounces), with a premium metallic (aluminum and polycarbonate) sheen. It&rsquo;s also a bit more expensive than its rivals. Anker&rsquo;s hub was among the coolest we&rsquo;ve tested under load, at about 87 degrees.</p>

<p>Overall, Anker&rsquo;s hub is well designed, with adequate spacing between the two 5Gbps USB-A ports. There&rsquo;s also a 5Gbps USB-C connection for data, plus a second USB-C port for power input at up to 85W rated. (The charger allows up to 100W in, but supplies 85W.) An HDMI port allows for 4K/30Hz video or 1080p/60Hz video to a single external display, standard for the category. Ethernet is excluded, however, so you&rsquo;ll need to use Wi-Fi instead. Cord length is about 8.5 inches, above the standard 6-inch length.</p>

<p>Anker&rsquo;s hub was among the fastest we tested to deliver data under load, including simultaneous data transfer between USB-A ports while the SD ports were active. The hub offers an 18-month warranty, and it even ships with a carrying pouch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We recommend <em>not</em> buying the more expensive $79.99 <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerExpand-Adapter-Delivery-Ethernet/dp/B0874M3KW4/&amp;xcust=2-1-402858-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Anker 8-in-1 Hub</a> on Amazon unless you&rsquo;re happy connecting to two 1080p (and not 4K) displays&hellip;which is perfectly fine. Otherwise, the two HDMI ports will only support two 4K displays at an eye-wearying 30Hz, not 60Hz.</p>

<p>Yeolibo may not be a name you recognize, but this USB-C hub is impressively detailed, with a small but extremely informative manual, clearly labeled ports, and well-rounded functionality. </p>

<p>This hub offers three USB 3.0 (5Gb/s) Type A ports, one USB 2.0 Type A port, a USB-C (5Gb/s) port, a USB-C PD charging port rated at 100W of input power, and an HDMI port. There are also microSD and SD slots capable of SDXC cards up to 2TB and SDR25 (25MB/s) data rates. There&rsquo;s no ethernet connection. The USB-C cable measures a comfortable six inches, though the connector at the end was a little stiff and took some fiddling to insert.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t have a 100W USB-C charger on hand to test, but the hub accepted 62.5W from our 65W USB-C charger.  It stayed cool throughout. The hub played back protected content via its HDMI port, as expected, but dropped more frames than we hoped for when playing back 4K content over YouTube. (Only 4K30 resolutions are supported, but that&rsquo;s not unusual.) </p>

<p>The QGeeM 7-in-1 Hub I received tried to buy me off with an in-box promotion that promised a $10 Amazon card if I left a positive review. But I didn&rsquo;t need to be bought off to appreciate this compact, lightweight little hub that covers all the basics, save ethernet.</p>

<p>The three USB 3.0 ports are adequately spaced. An HDMI port at the end of the dock supports a single 4K display at 30Hz (or 1080p at 60Hz)&mdash;par for the course with a typical USB-C hub. QGeeM&rsquo;s hub includes support for both SD and microSD slots, using the older, prevalent UHS-I SD card standard. Both cards share the same controller, allowing them to be used one card at a time. QGeeM&rsquo;s documentation varies on how much power it can provide; Amazon&rsquo;s page says it can accept 100W (3A) and supply 85W, though the in-box documentation says 60W. The latter is correct.  Nevertheless, a USB-C charger connected to the port reported that it was charging adequately. </p>

<p>Under load the hub warmed to about 94 degrees, a comfortable temperature.&nbsp;(Some customers have complained that the hub gets too hot and will shut down, but we didn&rsquo;t see this.)</p>

<p>QGeeM doesn&rsquo;t seem to offer warranty support, and the packaging skimps on niceties like a carrying bag. But this lightweight hub offers everything else a typical user will need, and for a great price.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lention&rsquo;s CB-C35sH feels a little cheap out of the box, with a bit of a rattle that indicates a corner or two were cut in the construction. It worked flawlessly, however. This USB-C hub is slightly wider than most, with a power input rated at 60W next to a HDMI 1.2 input (allowing 4K resolution on an external display, at 60Hz) that allows protected content to be played back with no problems. (Power input only reached 55W in our tests.) The entire hub remained cool, even with a charger attached.</p>

<p>In addition to the USB-C input port and HDMI output, there are four 5Gb/s USB Type A ports, and that&rsquo;s it&mdash;no microSD slots, ethernet, or audio connections. We would have liked to see the latter as an option for those who need it. But connecting a mouse and keyboard, as well as transferring data over the ports, worked well within the constraints of the USB-C connection. </p>

<p>Both our current overall top pick, the Anker A83460A2, and the Yeolibo 9-in-1 a are better overall options, with one exception: their HDMI output is only at 30Hz, which can fatigue the eyes over long periods. Lention delivers a more comfortable 60Hz at the same resolution. And if you have issues, Lention offers a 12-month warranty with a 24-hour support turnaround.</p>

<p>Lasuney&rsquo;s 10-in-1 hub (two USB 3.0 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, two HDMI 1.2 ports (4K@30Hz), DisplayPort gigabit ethernet, microSD/SD, USB-C power input) offers a lot for your money, including an unusual mix of not one, but two HDMI ports, and even a DisplayPort. Thanks to ethernet support, the hub can replace many of your wired connections. Power input is rated at 100W in, with about 87W available to the laptop.</p>

<p>But the USB-C bus the hub runs on top of simply won&rsquo;t support <em>all</em> of the ports being used at once, which is a bit of a gotcha. While we really like the pair of HDMI ports for dual-display configurations, the fact is, you&rsquo;ll probably need to limit yourself to a pair of 1080p displays to avoid saturating the bus and slowing down the connection.&nbsp;Customers on Amazon have reported that they only got one to work, probably because the bus itself was saturated. The other problem we found is that the SD card slot is way too slow. It took twice as long to transfer data compared to other hubs we tested. In all fairness, our other disk-to-disk tests took about the same amount of time.</p>

<p>Lasuney&rsquo;s hub is well made, with good port spacing. It doesn&rsquo;t get uncomfortably warm, either.&nbsp;Just be realistic: We really like the flexibility that the Lasuney hub offers, but don&rsquo;t buy it thinking you&rsquo;ll be able to use everything at once.</p>

<p>The AmazonBasics&nbsp;L6LUD001-CS-R provides three USB 3.1 Type A ports plus gigabit ethernet to your laptop&rsquo;s existing USB-C port. There are no HDMI or charging inputs; this is merely an incremental step up from the AmazonBasics&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MCTET84/ref=twister_B06ZY5GMN9?ots=1&amp;slotNum=1&amp;imprToken=54bfc4c9-4d61-0442-f81&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html">L6LUD012-CS-R</a>, which forgoes the ethernet capabilities.</p>

<p>This hub is handy for those who don&rsquo;t have or don&rsquo;t trust Wi-Fi on the go. The lengthy 14-inch cord adds some flexibility to your desktop layout. The hub performed comparably to the others we&rsquo;ve tested, and there weren&rsquo;t any issues with temperature or power.</p>

<p>At press time, the price was only $3 or so above the price of the aforementioned AmazonBasics L6LUD012-CS-R, which makes this a no-brainer if you just want a basic hub. Though the hub ships in both black and white, we noticed Amazon will occasionally discount one or the other by a few dollars. Honestly, though, the heated competition in the USB-C market means that the value this hub offers isn&rsquo;t as strong as it once was.</p>

<p>This is the Big Kahuna of USB-C docks&mdash;and, given what it does, you almost wonder why it wasn&rsquo;t made a Thunderbolt dock instead. At&nbsp;2.9 x 11.02 x 0.5 inches, it&rsquo;s a thin, long, slanted wedge that props up your laptop with a grippy rubber strip. It&rsquo;s a true dock, with a number of rear-facing ports optimized for dual displays, with a foot-long USB-C cable to boot.</p>

<p>Specifically, there&rsquo;s three USB 3.0 (Type A ports), one HDMI 1.4 port for 4K30 video, one DisplayPort 1.2 port, gigabit ethernet, one SD/SDHC port and a microSD slot (both USH-I), VGA, a 3.5mm jack, and a USB-C port for up to 100W of external charging. Some of the additional ports come with some caveats: The VGA connection must be used solo, for example, and not in conjunction with either DisplayPort or HDMI. Remember, all that data passed along the USB-C cable can interfere with one another, but IOgear plays it a bit conservative; the manual says that two hard drives can&rsquo;t be connected simultaneously, but that&rsquo;s not true.</p>

<p>Be advised that the BC 1.2 port provides up to 1.5A of power for quick-charging phones, though the port isn&rsquo;t compatible with the specialized quick-charging schemes of OnePlus or Samsung. (Phones from both manufacturers reported &ldquo;charging&rdquo; when connected, rather than &ldquo;Fast charging&rdquo;.) Thermal issues weren&rsquo;t a problem, and performance was surprisingly good, even with HDMI and ethernet connected. The doc supports Power Delivery 3.0 up to 85W, and consumes 15W by itself; in other words, if you have a 100W laptop charger feeding power to the hub, 85W will be left over for your laptop to use.</p>

<p>A price of about $125 or so is way more than you&rsquo;d expect to pay for a USB-C hub, but it&rsquo;s still less than a higher-speed Thunderbolt dock. Still, this USB-C hub is more of a USB-C dock; it&rsquo;s not really portable, and the form factor lends itself to a permanent spot on your desk.</p>

<p>This powered USB-C dock measures 3.25 x 9.5 x 1.25 inches, with a 3-foot USB-C to USB-C cable (or USB-C to USB-A), with four USB 3.0 (5Gbps) ports on the front and two more on the rear. Display ports are plentiful: two HDMI 2.0 ports and two DisplayPort 1.2 ports, allowing either a single 4K display at 60Hz or two at 30Hz. There&rsquo;s gigabit ethernet and a headphone jack, too. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll need to install a DisplayLink driver, which is a slightly different interface that runs over USB-C. The dock doesn&rsquo;t supply any power to the laptop itself, another black mark. But the inclusion of DisplayPort and its HDCP capabilities means you can watch Netflix, and in 4K if you&rsquo;d like. But all that data streaming over a USB-C connection also means that video playback is going to be stuttery. Nearly $180 is a ton of money to spend on a dock, too, though it comes with a two-year warranty.</p>

<p>As we point out below in our buying advice, the USB-C connection will be what limits this dock, not the dock itself. For a smoother connection, invest in a Thunderbolt dock if your PC supports it.</p>

We&rsquo;d rather see Lenovo pick either VGA&nbsp;<em>or</em> HDMI and add another USB port.</span></p>

<p><span class="a-size-large">To be fair though, all of the ports performed as expected and there was no perceptible heat increase when we tried to saturate the ethernet link and USB-C port simultaneously.</span></p>

<p id="block-9165f3bc-6543-4c98-8a94-fa3b6f2cf805">This Rshtech RS-516 USB-C port splitter uses an unusually long 2-foot cable to split a 5Gbps USB 3.0 input (over USB-C) and divide it among four USB 3.0 Type A ports. It&rsquo;s also uncommon to see those ports controlled by LED-lit button switches, and an optional&nbsp;5V/2A adapter powering the whole affair.</p>

<p id="block-7c0b3ca1-f0b7-43a2-b7d1-f360f2e91ae4">The port splitter takes the 5Gbps input and splits it among the ports, which are only active if the corresponding LED-lit button is depressed. This applies to both power (the hub will charge, though not fast-charge phones) and data. Port spacing isn&rsquo;t an issue, and the ABS/aluminum construct handles heat well.</p>

<p id="block-8b03991e-9aa7-4576-9ed7-27b7d6ab0e6c">The Rshtech hub wouldn&rsquo;t always identify and connect to a bus-powered SSD, but it found every other device we connected to it. The performance of a powered external hard drive plunged to about 20 percent when all ports were occupied, but surged to about 67 percent when the optional power cable was plugged in&mdash;which Rshtech recommends when connected to external storage.</p>

<p id="block-9747d7c5-02d6-48c4-ad65-0c3fcbeb3624">That cable (with a proprietary plug) is a pain, and the issues finding our SSD gave us pause. But we really liked how the hub allowed us access to and control of external hard drives, which spin up and down loudly and randomly.</p>

<p>There are <em>much</em> cheaper options to simply add support for two 1080p displays to your laptop, such as the (awfully named) $40 <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QKVY23Q/&amp;xcust=2-1-402858-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Selore&amp;S USB-C adapter</a>, which includes a pair of HDMI ports and nothing else. So why buy this $119 OWC device instead? It&rsquo;s really one of the few ways to connect to at least one 4K display using a USB-C cable.</p>

<p>For one thing, it&rsquo;s cheaper than the Plugable UD-6950H above, which contains dual HDMI and DisplayPort ports plus some additional I/O. OWC&rsquo;s adapter simply provides two HDMI ports and a passthrough USB-C port, which allows you to plug in a 90W USB-C charger and charge your laptop. OWC&rsquo;s adapter requires you to download DisplayLink drivers, then adjust your Windows display settings to re-enable 60Hz refresh rates one one display. (only 30Hz is allowed on the other.) Sound like a pain? It is, but that&rsquo;s what happens when you try to force a pair of high-definition displays across a bus that wasn&rsquo;t really designed for them.</p>

<p>At&nbsp;2.8 x 0.31 x 1.22 inches, IOgear&rsquo;s Travel Pro Mini Dock is an odd duck: an inexpensive, relatively tiny USB-C dock that plugs directly into your laptop, without a connecting cord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way this will work,&rdquo; you might think&mdash;but it does, with just enough room for your laptop&rsquo;s USB-C charger to sneak in one side of the dock, next to an HDMI cord, then a USB key or cord, and a 3.5mm jack. (The Mini Dock supports up to 60W of power in from an external charger.)</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s fine, of course, if your laptop&rsquo;s USB-C port is all by its lonesome. Otherwise, the Travel Pro Mini Dock will block ports as it tries to offer expansion capabilities&mdash;and that&rsquo;s a problem for laptops like the Asus ZenBook, which forego a 3.5mm headphone jack but cram their USB-C ports too close together to make IOgear&rsquo;s dock feasible.</p>

<p>We like the idea, but there are cheaper, better docks out there with more flexibility.</p>

<h2 class="toc" id="how-to-choose-a-usb-c-hub">How to choose a USB-C hub</h2>



<h3 id="first-take-stock-of-your-peripherals">First, take stock of your peripherals</h3>



<p>Here&rsquo;s where to start: Take a look at the peripherals you own, or plan to buy. Do you have an old external hard drive that uses a traditional USB-A cable? Do you manually back up photos from an SLR via its SD card? Or is your Wi-Fi connection unreliable enough that you&rsquo;d prefer ethernet? Figure out what ports you&rsquo;ll need. This advice is also for Windows users; Macs have their own limitations on USB-C connections.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined">
<figure class="wp-block-image large"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/12/usb-c-hub-power-shot-100781806-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="usb c hub power shot" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/12/usb-c-hub-power-shot-100781806-large.jpg" /></a><figcaption><p>This laptop has several USB-C ports, but if yours has just one, you&rsquo;ll want to daisy-chain the laptop&rsquo;s power cord by plugging it directly into the hub, like so.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>


<h3 id="next-check-out-what-ports-your-laptop-already-has">Next, check out what ports your laptop already has</h3>



<p>It&rsquo;s also important to take stock of your laptop or tablet&rsquo;s ports: Does it have one USB-C port or two? If your device only has one port, is there a separate charging connection? If your laptop or tablet has a USB-C port and&nbsp;<em>uses it exclusively for charging</em>, you&rsquo;ll want to buy a USB-C hub with a dedicated charging input port. (In this case, it&rsquo;s also possible that <em>only</em> the charging port on the hub will work, though this isn&rsquo;t typical.) Note how much input power it allows, and confirm that will be sufficient for your laptop. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll be forced to choose between charging your laptop and accessing other devices, which makes little sense.</p>



<h3 id="assess-your-laptop-and-peripheral-power-needs">Assess your laptop and peripheral power needs</h3>



<p>Keep in mind that the hub&rsquo;s power port is for taking power&nbsp;<em>in</em>&nbsp;to your laptop, and not&nbsp;<em>out</em>&nbsp;to a phone. But your hub may still be able to charge your phone, with some caveats. A &ldquo;bus-powered&rdquo; USB hub connects to your laptop&nbsp;<em>and</em> pulls power from it, which it has to share with several devices. A powered USB dock will take power from the wall, route it through your hub, and share it with any device connected to it. These devices will make more power available for fast charging your phone. (Your hub won&rsquo;t enable specialized charging like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3530319/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-review.html?page=2#toc-4">Samsung Galaxy S20</a>&rsquo;s Super Fast Charging, however, even if you use the supplied Samsung cable. You&rsquo;ll still need to connect your phone to its charger for that.)</p>



<h3 id="consider-a-thunderbolt-connection-if-available">Consider a Thunderbolt connection if available</h3>



<p>Some newer, pricier laptops now come with Thunderbolt connections, which offer a greater amount of bandwidth than a traditional USB-C connection. If this is the case, consider <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3596491/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">buying a Thunderbolt dock</a> instead. A USB-C port typically provides 5 or 10Gbps, while USB-C with Thunderbolt typically provides 40Gbps. (Consult your owner&rsquo;s manual or the published specifications of your laptop if you aren&rsquo;t sure.) </p>



<p>The bandwidth difference matters more as more devices are attached to the USB-C hub. For low-bandwidth devices like a mouse or a keyboard, bandwidth will never be an issue. External storage shouldn&rsquo;t be, either. But a USB-C hub with a display, and Ethernet, and external storage, <em>and</em> a mouse and keyboard all attached to it may clog the USB-C port. In the real world, that may mean slower data transfers from an external hard drive, or stuttering when playing a high-definition YouTube video. Normally, we&rsquo;d think that is the fault of the PC. In this case, it&rsquo;s not &mdash; it&rsquo;s all of that data flowing through the USB-C port. </p>



<p>Seriously, take this &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let your eyes get bigger than your stomach&rdquo; advice to heart. We were sent a Plugable USB-C Triple 4K HDMI and DisplayPort Display Horizontal Docking Station (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://(https://plugable.com/products/ud-6950pdz&amp;xcust=2-1-402858-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">UD-6950PDZ)</a> for review, which supposedly supports <em>three</em> 4K displays, Ethernet, and six USB ports, all running over a standard USB-C connection. Even with DisplayLink software compressing the video stream, that&rsquo;s just way too much to run over a generic USB-C connection. Two or three 1080p displays will be a better choice.</p>

<p>You can get around this, in part. Instead of using a dedicated Ethernet connection, you can use a separate Wi-Fi connection instead. The main exception is displays. USB-C delivers enough bandwidth to drive an external 1080p or 4K display, even two (provided your hub has a pair of HDMI or DisplayPort connectors). But while USB-C can drive a pair of 1080p displays at a good 60Hz, it can only run 4K displays at 30Hz, which can be fatiguing on the eyes.&nbsp;So simply keep that in mind when considering a USB-C hub or dock.</p>



<p>Remember, you&rsquo;ll need to own or buy a Thunderbolt-equipped laptop if you want more bandwidth. Again, the general reason to prefer Thunderbolt over USB-C are a desire for higher-resolution displays: if you want to run at 60Hz with your 4K monitor/s, you should choose from our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3596491/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">roundup of the best Thunderbolt docks</a>. If you pursue this route, pay attention to details: You&rsquo;ll need to ensure the dock and monitor support&nbsp;Dual-Mode DisplayPort 1.2 (DP++) ports, and the HDMI ports are rated at HDMI 2.0. (The vast majority already do.) </p>

</figcaption></figure></div>


<h3 id="finally-dont-worry-about-platform-branding">Finally, don&rsquo;t worry about platform branding</h3>



<p>Because USB-C is common among Macs, Windows PCs, and phones, some hubs align their branding with a particular platform. Go ahead and use that USB-C that&rsquo;s billed as being &ldquo;for MacBook Pro, Chromebook, and XPS&rdquo; with any Windows PC&mdash;we did, and it works just fine. You won&rsquo;t need any special software or drivers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="how-we-test-usb-c-hubs">How we test USB-C hubs</h2>



<p>We used bus-powered peripherals to test each hub: an SSD, a hard drive, and a rewriteable DVD drive, all to make sure enough power was being delivered. We also ran speed tests on those hubs with ethernet connections, just to detect any anomalous results. We performed spot checks with other peripherals.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/05/flexpow-hiearcool-usb-c-hub-100887145-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="flexpow hiearcool usb c hub" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/05/flexpow-hiearcool-usb-c-hub-100887145-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption><p>Even though two USB-C hubs may have wildly different brand names, you may sometimes find that they&rsquo;re otherwise identical or just very similar.</p> </figcaption></figure></div>




<p>We conducted standardized tests to transfer a file from the SSD to the laptop; from the hard drive to the SSD; and then from an SD card to the PC, while simultaneously transferring files from the hard drive to the SSD. In some cases we used AJA&rsquo;s System Tool app to run read and write tests on connected drives. In almost all cases, the performance was identical, with a spread of about 3 percent&mdash;good news for you, as that&rsquo;s one less thing to worry about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We measured the surface temperature while these tests were run.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll see some buyers on Amazon pages complaining about how hot a hub gets; some do get on the warmer side. Also, where we could, we measured the power input for each hub.</p>



<p>We looked at how SD cards were inserted&mdash;you&rsquo;d be surprised how many don&rsquo;t work unless they&rsquo;re inserted upside down!&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also noted the cord length, as shorter cables limit your options when positioning the hub around your laptop or tablet. Worst case, a short cable causes a hub to dangle from a tablet whose USB-C port is mounted toward the top. &nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined">
<figure class="wp-block-image large"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/12/usb-c-hub-keyd-2-100781809-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="usb c hub keys 2" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/12/usb-c-hub-keyd-2-100781809-large.jpg" /></a><figcaption><p>Why bother testing something as ridiculous as the spacing between the USB Type A ports? Because if you don&rsquo;t, you can run into this situation: Because the ports are spaced too closely together, only one of these USB keys can be inserted at a time.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>After testing about a dozen USB-C hubs, we can confirm that some no-names perform just as well as their more well-known counterparts, and for less money, too. One thing to keep in mind: Because price is so critical to our recommendations, know that some of the prices may change as manufacturers offer sales. Therefore some hubs we&nbsp;<em>didn&rsquo;t</em> recommend primarily based on price could become more purchase-worthy.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>A docking station and a USB-C hub serve similar purposes&mdash;extending the range of ports available for a laptop&mdash;but they aren&rsquo;t entirely the same.</p>



<p>USB-C hubs are generally more compact and portable port expanders. They come with a few ports which are mostly USB-C or USB-A ports, but higher end hubs come with SD Card slots and HDMI or DisplayPort inputs as well. USB-C hubs are designed to be small and easy to carry around with you but require power to be drawn from a laptop itself.</p>



<p>Docking stations on the other hand are larger and designed to be more stationary. They are meant to help turn your laptop into a desktop replacement. In terms of available ports, they come with everything a USB-C hub has and more. This includes connections for external monitors, Thunderbolt 4 ports, and Ethernet ports, among others. They are also powered via a power outlet allowing for all connected devices to be powered directly from the docking station.</p>

<p>Both USB-C and Thunderbolt ports are universal in that the same input can be used for both, but they are not exactly the same.

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>USB-C hubs can get warm or even hot while using them to transfer data or charge devices. This is because the electronic components and circuitry within hubs build up heat during use. Depending upon the hub&rsquo;s material, heat can become trapped inside the hub leading it to become hot to the touch.</p>



<p>If you are concerned about your hub becoming too hot during use, you may consider purchasing a hub made from metallic parts, such as aluminum, so that heat can more easily dissipate as it builds up.</p>

The so-called &ldquo;Dormant Colors&rdquo; adware is spread across an impressive thirty different individual extensions in both the Chrome Web Store and Microsoft&rsquo;s Edge Add-ons repository. (The latest version of Edge is based on Chromium case, and can run Chrome-based extensions without modification.) The extensions have also been spotted on spammy video download sites.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the identified extensions have been removed from the various stores. Anyone with the following extensions installed in their browser should remove them immediately: </p>

<p>While Google and Microsoft seem to have taken down the extensions known to be compromised, there&rsquo;s nothing stopping the developers from simply making more accounts and re-uploading them, to say nothing of the &ldquo;wild&rdquo; versions loaded onto spam websites.

<p>Put simply, Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface Laptop 5 is Microsoft&rsquo;s answer to your question: <em>What laptop should I buy?</em> The Surface Laptop is Microsoft&rsquo;s laptop for everyone, its Toyota Camry, remaining virtually unchanged for generation after generation. Your only choice is the size &mdash; 13.5-inch or 15-inch &mdash; and what configuration you prefer.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394409/surface-laptop-4-ryzen-7-review.html">our review of the Microsoft Surface Laptop 4</a>, you know almost exactly what to expect. The Surface Laptop 5 is nearly physically identical (with a sliver of difference here and there) to its predecessor, in both the 13.5-inch and 15-inch editions. Microsoft gave us the 15-inch version for review.</p>



<p>The key changes are largely internal: an upgrade to Intel&rsquo;s 12th-gen Core (&ldquo;Alder Lake&rdquo;) and the addition of Thunderbolt 4, which is tied to that processor&rsquo;s capabilities. The latter is subtly significant, as it eliminates the dependence on Microsoft&rsquo;s proprietary Surface Dock and allows you to choose from the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">broader ecosystem of Thunderbolt docks</a> instead. Thunderbolt and/or a Thunderbolt dock provides a sizeable upgrade in external I/O bandwidth, and that allows you to connect a multitude of legacy devices including two 4K, 60Hz displays. That significantly increases the Surface Laptop 4&rsquo;s productivity possibilities.</p>



<p>The other interesting change that the Surface Laptop 5 brings with it is the elimination of an AMD Ryzen processor option, which in previous generations provided options for performance and battery life. Unfortunately, Microsoft simply settled on Intel&rsquo;s 12th-gen Core (Alder Lake) for the Surface Laptop 5.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop 5" class="wp-image-1359603" height="1055" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/primary-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface Laptop 5.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Microsoft made a more subtle change in the display with the addition of Dolby Vision IQ, a technology more commonly found in TVs to optimize high-dynamic range (HDR) content. Dolby IQ uses what the Laptop&rsquo;s light sensor tells it about the ambient light in the room, and tries to adjust the display output to give you the best experience. (For more, see PCWorld Australia&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/670492/what-dolby-vision-iq/&amp;xcust=2-1-1357810-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed">Dolby IQ explainer</a>.)</p>



<p>Microsoft also continues to provide a Surface Laptop for Business option, which provides the only option for those who prefer Windows 11 Pro, versus Windows 11 Home. For consumers, the advantages are minimal. But Business customers receive a slightly upgraded processor option, Windows 11 Pro, and better support. (The difference between the Core i7-1255U and Core 17-1265U is 100MHz.) Improved support may be important, as more of the Surface Laptop&rsquo;s components are now replaceable, including the motherboard, battery, and more &mdash; but (officially) only by an approved technician.</p>

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s base pricing has not increased over the Surface Laptop 4&rsquo;s introductory price, which earns praise in a world where &ldquo;inflation&rdquo; is now a common topic. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 pricing" class="wp-image-1346629" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Surface-Laptop-5-pricing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="989" /><figcaption>Microsoft sent us an email with the pricing for the various Surface Laptop 5 models.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<h2 class="toc" id="surface-laptop-5-out-of-the-box">Surface Laptop 5: Out of the box</h2>



<p>I&rsquo;ve used Surface Laptops as test beds for various Windows iterations for years now, so the latest 15-inch Surface Laptop 5 feels more familiar than anything else. Many compare the Surface Laptop to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.macworld.com/article/667144/macbook-air-or-macbook-pro.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1357810-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed">an Apple MacBook</a>, and the monolithic aluminum chassis feels incredibly sturdy as you pull it out of the box. Forget stickers, RGB lighting, or special-purpose buttons &mdash; Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface Laptop 5 is designed to be plain, simple, and productive. You can buy the 13.5-inch Laptop 5, with an option to coat the chassis in black Alcantara fabric, but you&rsquo;ll probably prefer the metal configurations instead.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, the Surface Laptop platform has traditionally included a single USB-C port alongside a USB-A port on previous iterations. In the Surface Laptop 5, that USB-C port has been upgraded to Thunderbolt 4, in addition to the legacy Surface Connect port on the right side of the laptop. That means that you now have three charging options: a legacy Surface Dock or Surface Dock 2; a new (though admittedly pricey) powered Thunderbolt dock; as well as the 65W charger that ships inside of the box. </p>



<p>Our review unit shipped with a Core i7 inside, keyed to the &ldquo;Recommended&rdquo; power setting within Windows 11. That&rsquo;s typically the lowest-performance setting, optimized for long battery life. Still, you&rsquo;ll be really hard-pressed to hear any sort of fan noise at all on these default settings, even under severe loads. Even set to maximum performance, there&rsquo;s only a faint, pleasant hiss. That&rsquo;s a credit to both Microsoft and Intel engineers, which optimized the internal components in accordance with the new Intel Evo specification. Our tests do show that there&rsquo;s a bit of thermal throttling, however, where the Laptop will self-regulate its performance to prevent overheating. We&rsquo;ll talk more about that in our performance section.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop 5" class="wp-image-1359602" height="799" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/right-side-better.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Surface Connect port adorns the right side of the Surface Laptop 5.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Remember, Microsoft says that its customers have told it that they don&rsquo;t changes to the Laptop platform &mdash; though you may wonder a bit at the hefty screen bezels that total about 3/8 of an inch on the sides and slightly more at the top. Rivals who extend their displays to nearly the end of the chassis won&rsquo;t get any competition here. Several years ago, that sort of thing was ignored. Now, you can&rsquo;t help but raise an eyebrow.</p>



<p>Still, there&rsquo;s no denying that Microsoft&rsquo;s Surfaces continue to offer one of the most dynamic and attractive displays around. Rival laptops waffle between 1080p and 4K displays; Microsoft wanders somewhere between with 1504p and 1664p displays on the 13.5-inch and 15-inch Laptops, using an uncommon 3:2 screen ratio. Our 15-inch review unit generated 384 nits of screen luminance (we consider 250 nits or so ideal for indoor use) which allows the Laptop 5 to be used outside on the sunny days that linger on the West Coast. Microsoft also got rid of the display brightness nonsense with the Surface Laptop 4 &mdash; then, Microsoft would dim the display on battery. Now, the Laptop 5 runs as bright on battery as plugged into the wall.</p>

<p>The Laptop 5 continues to offer a pair of color profiles &mdash; Vivid and sRGB &mdash; that continue to deliver great color accuracy. The Surface Laptop 5 does not offer a 120Hz option (either dynamic or fixed) however, since Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t see the Laptop as much of a &ldquo;creator&rdquo; product as a Surface Pro 9 tablet or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/538948/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-review-the-future-is-here.html">Surface Laptop Studio</a>, which do. It&rsquo;s still compatible with Microsoft&rsquo;s Pen Protocol (MPP). however. </p>

<p>Microsoft also offers <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/670492/what-is-dolby-vision-iq/&amp;xcust=2-1-1357810-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Dolby Vision IQ</a>, new for the Surface Laptop 5, which interacts with the Laptop&rsquo;s lighting sensor to provide a more dramatic experience, modulating the display brightness to punch up the display&rsquo;s output. We didn&rsquo;t notice any dramatic improvement due to this feature, but it&rsquo;s possible it needs some fine-tuning.</p>



<p>In addition to the Thunderbolt port and the handy legacy USB-A port for a mouse, Microsoft preserved the 3.5mm headphone jack it eliminated in the Surface Pro 9. There are no microSD or SD card slots, though those can be added via a USB-C dongle. There are no Kensington or other locks at all.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop 5" class="wp-image-1359600" height="799" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/left-side-better.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>On the left side of the Surface Laptop 5 is a USB-A port, an (unlabeled) Thunderbolt 4 port, and a headphone jack.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>We were happy to see that the Surface Laptop connected via a Thunderbolt dock to a pair of 4K displays, delivering the expected 60Hz refresh rates to both screens.</p>



<h2 id="are-the-surface-laptop-5-keyboard-webcam-and-audio-worth-it">Are the Surface Laptop 5 keyboard, webcam, and audio worth it?</h2>



<p>All of these aspects are virtually unchanged from the Surface Laptop 4, and that&rsquo;s a good thing. We&rsquo;d characterize all three aspects as decent to very good.</p>



<p>Microsoft Surface keyboards used to be among the best in the industry, but Microsoft reduced the key travel to 1.3mm. Personally, I equate the deeper key travel on Lenovo laptops and premier HP devices to deeper cushioning on a running shoe. It&rsquo;s fair to say that 1.3mm travel is still comfortable. Otherwise, the Surface keyboard remains unchanged, with a top row of narrow keys devoted to common laptop functions and that&rsquo;s about it. There are three levels of backlighting.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop 5" class="wp-image-1359605" height="886" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/keyboard-better.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The keyboard of the Microsoft Surface Laptop 5.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>The Surface Laptop 5 trackpad is still excellent, clickable nearly to the top. Gestures worked as expected.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Microsoft seems to have settled on a 720p webcam as the default resolution for the Surface Laptop lineup, even though other Surface products, such as the Surface Pro series, have adopted the superior 1080p resolution. Like all Surface devices, Microsoft uses a depth camera and Windows Hello to log you in via biometrics. Even after just a few seconds of training, it does an excellent job of recognizing you, though our history of older Surface devices indicates that you&rsquo;ll need to retrain it over time, especially if you&rsquo;ve grown a beard or shaved it. A PIN serves as a backup.</p>



<p>Microsoft seems to have resolved some of its issues with the camera on the previous Surface Laptop 4. A new face-finding feature on the Camera app attempts to balance lighting and color around your face, rather than the scene at large. The camera appears to capture more of the scene, as well. On balance, it&rsquo;s an overall improvement even if the resolution is slightly lacking compared to the competition. Unfortunately, Microsoft&rsquo;s new Studio Effects (face tracking, background blur, and more) that it developed for Windows 11 22H2 requires an Arm processor that, for now, that the Surface Laptop 5 lacks.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop 5" class="wp-image-1359714" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Webcam-shot.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 webcam seems more color-accurate than its predecessor, though everything looks fuzzy and soft. Microsoft tried to save some money here, it appears.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>The audio experience on the Surface Laptop 5 has noticeably degraded from the prior generation, however: the maximum volume has decreased, and the overall soundscape sounds flatter than before. Microsoft still includes its Omnisonic speakers with Dolby Atmos backing them up, but either the wattage decreased or something&rsquo;s slightly muffling the speakers. Overall, they&rsquo;re still decent, but I&rsquo;d probably say that I&rsquo;m now more inclined to listen to music using headphones than the Laptop&rsquo;s speakers, a break from the past. </p>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s crapware-free &ldquo;Signature&rdquo; Editions of laptops that it sold on its Web site may have disappeared, but Microsoft has never loaded up its Surface devices with unwanted apps, to its credit. In fact, during the setup process, you can specify what you&rsquo;re going to use the Surface for (entertainment, family, gaming, etc.) and it will suggest apps and websites to help you get started. Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video appeared on the Surface Laptop 5 after I told Windows that I would use it for entertainment during the setup process.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 Xbox Game Pass" class="wp-image-1359712" height="511" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Game-Pass.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>A trial to Xbox Game Pass is one of the perks that ship with the Surface Laptop 5, provided you configure the laptop correctly during setup.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<h2 class="toc" id="how-fast-is-the-surface-laptop-5">How fast is the Surface Laptop 5?</h2>



<p>At this point, virtually every standard &ldquo;X86&rdquo; PC processor from Intel or AMD will run Windows and most apps just fine, though you&rsquo;ll find some glitches along the way. Memory matters more than processing power when browsing, and the Laptop 5&rsquo;s 16GB easily provides enough for dozens of tabs. The lack of a discrete GPU means that any game playing will be limited, though you&rsquo;ll be able to play games using 2D sprites and some basic 3D games.</p>



<p>I was a little disappointed to see that the Surface Laptop dropped 120 out of 11,581 frames playing back a test stream from YouTube, especially because YouTube (sensing the capabilities of the hardware) only delivered a 1664&times;936 stream instead. That may mean that overall streaming performance is less than expected.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that, for whatever reason, Microsoft sets the&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/customize-power-slider&amp;xcust=2-1-394409-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/394409/surface-laptop-4-ryzen-7-review.html">Windows power/performance slider</a>&nbsp;to prolong the battery life at the expense of performance, even when plugged in. Simply adjusting it to full performance can give you a massive performance boost under certain scenarios, so we tested that, too. You&rsquo;ll find the Surface Laptop 5&rsquo;s standard test scores marked in red; we ran separate tests with the &ldquo;best performance&rdquo; setting, and we&rsquo;ve outlined those scores with a black bar. As you&rsquo;ll see, in some cases it makes a massive difference.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface Laptop will slightly thermally throttle itself, slowing itself down to prevent overheating. We saw this in the CPU, where performance dropped 5 percent over time, and in the GPU, where the laptop&rsquo;s graphics performance dropped about 8 percent.</p>



<p>We consider the $1799.99 Surface Laptop 5 to be a somewhat pricy but otherwise mainstream laptop, so we&rsquo;ve compared them to others: the $900 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/395111/acer-swift-x-review-a-rare-ultraportable-laptop-with-bite.html">Acer Swift X</a>, the $1,200 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3609170/acer-swift-3x-review-intel-xe-max-magic.html">Acer Swift 3X</a>, the $1,715 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3596307/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-9310-review-intels-11th-gen-peps-up-this-petite-laptop.html">Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 9310</a>, and the $1,210 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3609173/hp-envy-14-review-2021.html">HP Envy 14</a>.

<p>Our standard benchmark suite includes a choice of real-world and synthetic benchmarks, with an eye towards trying to evaluate both applications you use and those you may not. Our first, PCMark 10, tests both office work, light gaming, CAD, photo editing, performance during video calls, and more. At default settings, the Surface Laptop 5 is simply anemic, comparably. Dial up the performance, though, and performance jumps by 28 percent. Suddenly, it&rsquo;s a contender.</p>

<p>We use Cinebench, a synthesized benchmark, to try and determine how well the laptop will perform on an application which leans hard into using the entire processor&rsquo;s capabilities. Notice all of the AMD Ryzen laptops clustered at the top. The 12th-gen Core laptops at the top use Intel&rsquo;s P-series processors, which offer greater performance. There&rsquo;s a clear gap between the 11th-gen and 12th-gen Core laptops, but Microsoft isn&rsquo;t exactly dominating the segment. Remember, too, that the Surface Laptop 5 doesn&rsquo;t offer a Ryzen option.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 Cinebench R15" class="wp-image-1359713" height="758" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Cinebench-R15.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The story  here is the sudden dominance of AMD Ryzen processors in the space, which also hurts the Laptop 5 versus its predecessor.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Handbrake, a real-world video transcoding tool, does the same &mdash; but with an emphasis on prolonged work, so that we can see how long the laptop will perform using sustained workloads. This is a  good test of both prolonged performance, but also how well the laptop can cool itself to sustain a prolonged workload. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 Handbrake" class="wp-image-1359710" height="684" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Handbrake.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Again, Handbrake presents a scenario where dialing up the performance slider makes a significant difference. Otherwise, Intel&rsquo;s 12th-gen Core processors don&rsquo;t really hold up to AMD&rsquo;s two-generation-old Ryzen 4000 chips.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Finally, we use 3DMark as a way to evaluate the performance of the integrated Iris Xe 3D core and its implications for some light gaming. Only pay attention to the top four scores here if you&rsquo;re interested in purchasing a laptop with a discrete GPU &mdash; which is a perfectly fine idea if other aspects like battery life hold up. Here, the 12th-gen Core chip within the Surface Laptop 5 shows definite improvement over the Surface Laptop 4 and its Ryzen CPU.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop Time Spy fixed" class="wp-image-1360605" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/3DMark-Time-Spy-fixed.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>This is a quite respectable showing for the Surface Laptop 5.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Because the scores for the Surface Laptop 5 were sometimes lower than the Surface Laptop 4, we wondered why. Could it be the internal SSD was slowing the machine down? Using CrystalDiskMark 8.0.1, we tested the Surface Laptop 4 and 5. The Surface Laptop 5&rsquo;s SSD measured noticeably faster: 882.46MB/s read and 779.65MB/s writes for the Surface Laptop 4, and 2,252MB/s reads and 1,933MB/s writes for the Surface Laptop 5. We have to conclude that the Ryzen chip simply made more of a difference.</p>



<p>Of course, we also tested the battery life of the Surface Laptop 5, with a looped 4K video that ran until the battery expires. One key is that we use a much brighter display that we think is typical for the average user, rather than the extremely dim screen brightness that Microsoft uses in its rated battery life. We believe that our tests more directly correspond to real-world usage, with expected battery life significantly less than the 17 hours that Microsoft claimed.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 battery life" class="wp-image-1360341" height="703" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Battery-life.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The battery life of the Surface Laptop 5 is merely average, at roughly 10.5 hours. (Chart above is measured in minutes.)</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<h2 class="toc" id="should-you-buy-the-surface-laptop-5">Should you buy the Surface Laptop 5?</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop 5" class="wp-image-1359604" height="979" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/straight-on-edited.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s a tough sell. Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface displays are always a strong suit, and we&rsquo;re unabashed fans of the simple, unadorned design. A Core i7, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of SSD storage demands some sort of a premium. But remove that display, and a device like the 14-inch Acer Swift X costs $500 less and offers more everyday PC performance, far better graphics, and exceptional battery life.</p>



<p>In fact, Microsoft&rsquo;s decision to eliminate AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen from this generation of Laptops looks a bit short-sighted, in retrospect. Our performance numbers simply show Ryzen chips clustering near the top of the performance charts. As we&rsquo;ve shown, though, turn up the Windows performance slider! Doing so elevates everything the Laptop has to offer, and considerably so.</p>



<p>Essentially, Surface devices have always commanded a premium. That&rsquo;s fine, especially in niches (the Surface Pro tablet, the excellent Surface Laptop Studio) where the competition isn&rsquo;t as fierce. As someone who uses laptops daily, the smooth, spacious design absolutely resonates. But with now <em>three</em> generations of Surface Laptops that Microsoft has left virtually unchanged, it&rsquo;s best to conclude that Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface Laptop 5 emphasizes design, not value or raw performance. Take your pick: buy the Microsoft Laptop 5 if you&rsquo;re in the first camp. Otherwise, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">look elsewhere</a>.</p>

<p>We recommend that you consider buying the Microsoft Surface Pro 9 (5G) Windows tablet, with an Arm chip&mdash;<em>not</em> an Intel or AMD chip&mdash;inside. That&rsquo;s a first for us, and we hope it&rsquo;s not the last.</p>



<p>Read reviews of the Surface Pro 9 with a large grain of salt, because there are two significantly different products hiding under the same brand name. The <em>Surface Pro 9</em> is built on an Intel 12th-gen Core chip (Alder Lake), while the <em>Surface Pro 9 (5G) </em>uses a separate SQ3 chip co-developed by Qualcomm to Microsoft&rsquo;s specifications. We&rsquo;re reviewing the Surface Pro 9 (5G) here. </p>



<p>The Surface Pro 9 (5G) is essentially the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398356/microsoft-surface-pro-x-review.html">Surface Pro X</a>, now renamed and brought under the Surface Pro 9 brand umbrella. Inside it is the SQ3, an Arm chip that&rsquo;s technically incompatible with the X86 architecture of Intel&rsquo;s Core and AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen processors, but can run <em>most</em> Windows apps both via a special Arm-optimized version of Windows 11 plus a special code interpreter.</p>



<p>What it boils down to is this: The Surface Pro 9 (5G) should offer somewhat more battery life and somewhat less performance than the Core version of the tablet, based on our tests. But it&rsquo;s not that much less, and that&rsquo;s the surprise. Nevertheless, there are still application compatibility issues if you wander too far from its mission: handling day-to-day Office tasks and browsing via Microsoft Edge. </p>



<p>The Surface Pro 9 (5G) is also the only SP9 to include a 5G radio inside, meaning that you&rsquo;ll enjoy always-on connectivity once you leave the range of the nearest Wi-Fi router. We&rsquo;re also told that Microsoft does not plan to sell a 5G version of the Surface Pro 9 with a Core chip inside, either &mdash; if you want an always-connected Surface Pro 9, the Surface Pro 9 (5G) is it. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Surface Pro 9 liberty keyboard" class="wp-image-1351968" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/liberty-edition-keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>A special Liberty Floral keyboard is available in limited quantities to celebrate the Surface line&rsquo;s 10th anniversary.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>Unlike the Surface Pro 9, the Surface Pro 9 (5G) does not include a pair of Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, which usually requires an Intel processor. Instead, the Surface Pro 9 (5G) includes standard USB-C ports rated at the vanilla 10Gbps spec instead. This matters in two ways: first, you won&rsquo;t be able to use a Thunderbolt dock to expand this tablet&rsquo;s I/O capabilities. You also won&rsquo;t be able to use a powered <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">Thunderbolt dock</a> to charge the tablet either, and will have to depend on the 39W charger to charge the tablet through the Surface Connect port. </p>



<p>This is not an enormous issue; you can use <a href="https://store.pcworld.com/microsoft/microsoft-surface-dock-2-docking-station-910041d3fc1f49a884566402bc678fbf-p.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface Dock 2</a>, the upcoming <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1346567/microsoft-audio-dock-presenter-plus-your-new-teams-gadgets.html">Microsoft Audio Dock</a>, or an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html">inexpensive USB-C dongle</a> to provide some I/O expansion capabilities, and the in-box charger works just fine. But it&rsquo;s another difference between the two.</p>



<p>Otherwise, aside from shaving a sliver off of the chassis weight, the Surface Pro 9 is essentially the same as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/538941/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review.html">Surface Pro 8</a>: the same design, with a Surface Pro Signature Keyboard (sold separately) which can tuck the optional Surface Slim Pen 2 (usually bundled with the Signature Keyboard) into its recharging cubby. Two new color options are available: Sapphire and Forest, with a special Liberty floral blue Surface Pro 9 color option in limited quantities to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Surface tablet.</p>



<p>Microsoft has continued to offer two sub-versions of the Surface Pro 9 and Surface Pro 9 (5G), which vary by operating system. Our review unit of the Surface Pro 9 (5G), supplied by Microsoft, uses Windows 11 Home. An optional Surface Pro 9 (5G) for Business ships with both Windows 11 Pro. Business customers also enjoy better support options.</p>

<h2 class="toc" id="microsoft-surface-pro-9-5g-out-of-the-box">Microsoft Surface Pro 9 (5G): Out of the box</h2>



<p>Microsoft sent us a Surface Pro Signature Keyboard in what appears to be the Sapphire color, along with the Surface Slim Pen 2.</p>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s setup process doesn&rsquo;t seem to differ too much from what Windows 11 now asks of you. You&rsquo;ll still need a Microsoft account to proceed, though that opens the door for automatic installation of Microsoft 365 (Office 365) as well as migrating apps and settings from any other previous installations. Expect to see the Surface app pop up randomly early on, asking you to set up your Surface Slim Pen 2, including questions about what hand you ink with as well as a general overview of how the pen works. Inking is far more fundamental to the Surface Pro experience than, say, the Surface Laptop 5. </p>



<p>The power button and volume rocker have wandered about the top and sides of the Surface Pro over the last few generations. The Surface Pro 9 (5G) returns to the design of the Surface Pro 7+, with the power and volume rocker on top, next to one another.</p>



<p>The Surface Pro 9 (5G), like its 5G-less cousin, is a Windows tablet, with the SP9&rsquo;s traditional kickstand that allows it to recline just 15 degrees or so off of the horizontal. The Surface Pro 9 experience is part consumption, as the lightweight tablet and kickstand allows it to be propped up in all sorts of non-traditional locations; part creation, via inking on the tablet; and part productivity, with the magnetically attached Signature keyboard allowing it to emulate a traditional clamshell notebook. It does all of these pretty well.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 9 (5G)" class="wp-image-1359613" height="580" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/recline-right-side-edit.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>In general, the Surface Pro tablets do best on a flat surface, versus a typical clamshell laptop which can perch on your lap. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll have to hold the 13-inch SP9 tablet up, grasping it by the rather large bezels on the sides. The display matches the Surface Pro 8, which increased the display size slightly, with better resolution than rival tablets from Dell and others. You might think by now that Microsoft would use some sort of AI intelligence to sense which fingers are merely holding the tablet, and which are interacting with it. That&rsquo;s not the case, and everything looks a bit antiquated as a result.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 9 (5G)" class="wp-image-1359610" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/left-side.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>A pair of USB-C (not Thunderbolt) ports are on the left side of the Surface Pro 9 (5G). But where&rsquo;s the headphone jack?</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>When comparing it to other tablets like the Apple iPad or the Samsung Galaxy Tab series, the Surface Pro 9 is hard-pressed to hold its own. But in the Windows space, versus traditional laptops, the SP9 stands out, with a display resolution that pushes past 1440p and with excellent pixel density. The PixelSense Flow screen continues to be simply beautiful, with a dynamic 120Hz option for improved smoothness and inking. </p>



<p>According to our colorimeter, the Surface Pro 9 (5g) puts out an extremely bright 443 nits of screen luminance <em>and</em> covers much of the sRGB color gamut as well. That&rsquo;s about ten more nits than the Surface Pro 8 pushed out, and should allow you to work in the shade, if not daylight. That&rsquo;s ideal for an on-the-go, connected tablet.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 9 (5G) color gamut" class="wp-image-1360489" height="781" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/color-gamut-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Surface Pro 9 (5G) emphasizes creativity, with a wide color gamut.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s 5G tablet foregoes <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/670492/what-dolby-vision-iq/&amp;xcust=2-1-1357826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed">Dolby Vision IQ</a>, a visual display improvement that the new Surface Laptop 5 includes but this device does not.</p>



<p>The Surface Pro 9 (5G) uses an Arm processor, typically much more power-efficient than an X86 chip. It&rsquo;s fanless, and justifiably so; we could hardly feel any warmth on the rear of the tablet, either after copying files, decompressing them, or running workloads. The tablet only became marginally warm when connecting it to a secondary display via a USB-C cable.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 9 (5G)" class="wp-image-1359617" height="903" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/afternoon-sun-edited.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Surface Pro 9 (5G) puts out enough light that you can work in moderate daylight. This was taken about 3PM, on a sunny day.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Unlike the Surface Laptop 5 (or virtually any other product that uses an Intel or AMD X86 processor) the Windows&rsquo; performance settings have no effect. With an X86 chip, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394854/how-to-turn-on-power-mode-in-windows-11-for-increased-performance.html">you can get significantly increased performance for free</a>; with the Surface Pro 9 (5G) the settings are there, but are just for show.</p>



<p>We understand that while Microsoft would have liked to add in Thunderbolt, that just didn&rsquo;t happen. We have a 4K test display that includes a USB-C input, and it powered that display without any problems at all. (Naturally, it can only run its internal display at 120Hz, however.) Microsoft phased out the microSD card slot in earlier Surface Pro models, but you can &ldquo;replace&rdquo; that with a separate USB-C dongle.</p>



<h2 id="how-is-the-surface-pro-9-5g-to-type-on">How is the Surface Pro 9 (5G) to type on?</h2>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface Pro Signature Keyboards haven&rsquo;t changed that much in the last few years, save for the addition of the charging cubby for the Slim Pen 2. Yes, the magnetic connector holding the keyboard to the tablet does secure the tablet well enough to use it on your lap, but you&rsquo;ll probably prefer to use it on a desk or tabletop in most cases. While you&rsquo;ll probably prefer the stability of typing on a clamshell laptop, the inclined Signature Keyboard is absolutely usable for everyday use.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 9 (5G)" class="wp-image-1359615" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The  Surface Pro Signature Keyboard hides the Slim Pen 2, tucked underneath the fold.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="what-happened-to-the-surface-pro-9s-headphone-jack">What happened to the Surface Pro 9&rsquo;s headphone jack?</h2>



<p>The Surface Pro 9 (5G)&rsquo;s speakers provide a soft but balanced soundscape with noticeably less volume than prior generations. Put against the Surface Pro 8, there&rsquo;s simply little point of comparison: previous Surface tablets have punched above their weight in terms of audio quality, and the Surface Pro 9 (5G) seems to be trading on that legacy with less to back it up. Yes, the specs say that there&rsquo;s still the same 2W speakers inside it, but I find that hard to believe.</p>



<p>In fact, the Surface Pro 8 has a toggle switch within the Windows 11 Settings menu to toggle on audio enhancements. The Surface Pro 9 (5G) lacks that feature, and frankly sounds almost identical to the SP8 with that switch toggled off. Using headphones, though, thankfully rectifies those flaws, and my Google Pixel earbuds sounded terrific.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 9 (5G)" class="wp-image-1359611" height="958" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rear.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Surface Pro 9 (5G) still ships with a rear camera, if that&rsquo;s your thing.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting, though that those are Pixel <em>USB-C</em> wired earbuds. Why? Because the Surface Pro 9 (5G) has joined the ranks of those devices that have killed off the headphone jack alongside the Surface Pro X &mdash; still a black mark in my book. I don&rsquo;t want to have to charge Bluetooth earbuds to use my tablet. If you feel differently, that&rsquo;s fine. </p>



<p>The Surface Pro 9 (5G)&rsquo;s webcam, however, is one of the device&rsquo;s highlights. First, the Surface Pro family has always used a 1080p webcam, and they&rsquo;re usually among the best of any laptop or tablet, anywhere. Though the webcam image shot with the camera is a bit soft, the image quality, color, and lighting is quite good. I typically capture these webcam images in the morning, but this was captured in the afternoon, with side light. It&rsquo;s still very well done.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 9 (5G) webcam" class="wp-image-1360491" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/WIN_20221023_14_03_07_Pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The image captured by the Surface Pro 9 (5G)&rsquo;s webcam is pretty good, with good detail, lighting, and color.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>But there&rsquo;s another reason to buy the Surface Pro 9 (5G), and that&rsquo;s what Microsoft calls Windows Studio Effects. Inexplicably, they&rsquo;re buried within the Settings menu (<em>Settings &gt; Bluetooth &amp; devices &gt; Cameras &gt; Surface Camera front</em>) but they&rsquo;re offered (right now) on no other Surface device Microsoft offers.</p>



<p>Specifically, Windows Studio Effects offer three features: background effects (specifically blurring), Eye Contact, and automatic framing. While other applications offer background blurring, the key is that Windows offers this as a general control, so it isn&rsquo;t dependent on the app itself. (It&rsquo;s a little unclear whether an app&rsquo;s effects will be able to override this or not.) Microsoft offers two blurs: a &ldquo;portrait&rdquo; blur that vaguely blurs the background, and a deeper &ldquo;standard&rdquo; blur&rdquo; that makes the background largely unrecognizable. These are all previewable within Settings, by the way.</p>



<p>Interestingly, both models of the Surface Pro 9 ship with a webcam with a 4-degree tilt, which we have to assume contributes to its capability for automatic framing.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 9 (5G) webcam Windows Studio Effects blur" class="wp-image-1360490" height="579" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Standard-blur.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>This Windows blur is a necessity for a crowded home office, full of various test equipment and so on.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Eye Contact is a feature that, like FaceTime for Apple&rsquo;s iOS, attempts to use AI to fix your gaze on the camera, no matter if you&rsquo;re actually looking at something else. Again, this is a Windows control, so it should be active in Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, and other apps. But it&rsquo;s not previewable, so you&rsquo;ll have to trust (ha!) that you&rsquo;ll look as if you&rsquo;re actually paying attention. (It didn&rsquo;t work with a phone movie I recorded of my face, with my eyes darting this way and that.) That&rsquo;s a bit risky during those group meetings or staff calls, so play it safe until you can test it out with a friend.</p>



<p>Automatic framing does work, however. In a perfect world, automatic framing would work as a sort of face tracking, tracking your face as you move around. And it does! &mdash; within some limits. The webcam does a nice job of identifying your face and zooming in to it. If you&rsquo;re seated at your desk during a call, it&rsquo;s unlikely that this will make a difference. But if you stand up or slide your chair back, automatic framing should step in. We captured automatic framing in action to create this GIF, below.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Surface Pro 9 5G Windows 11 22H2 Automatic framing" class="wp-image-1359626" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Face-tracking.gif?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Note that you&rsquo;ll need  Windows 11&rsquo;s 2022 Update, <em>and</em> the October experiences update, <em>and</em> a device with a Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 or equivalent (SQ3)  to make this work.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="how-is-the-surface-pro-9-5g-for-inking">How is the Surface Pro 9 (5G) for inking?</h2>



<p>The Surface Pro 9 (5G) continues to support the tablet well, even maximally reclined, for inking. Microsoft has also finally nailed the pen&rsquo;s design, too: though you&rsquo;ll need to buy a Surface Pro Signature Keyboard, the way that the flat Surface Slim Pen 2 conceals itself within it and charges when not in use is just about perfect. (Make sure not to buy the Slim Pen 2 separately without the keyboard, as the standalone Pen 2 doesn&rsquo;t come with a charger.) </p>



<p>One of the few things we haven&rsquo;t tested was how long the Slim Pen 2 lasts; Microsoft says that the pen&rsquo;s internal rechargeable battery can last up to 15 hours, which should be just fine before it has to be returned to its cubby to recharge. We haven&rsquo;t had any complaints, nor do the users we interact with online.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Surface Pro 9 side" class="wp-image-1351983" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Surface-Pro-9-side.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Slim Pen 2, inside the charging cubby.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>The Slim Pen 2&rsquo;s flat shape is a bit awkward to use, though the redesigned Pen 2 has a sharper nib, allowing for more precision. It also applies 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity. I really can&rsquo;t tell how accurate this all is, though we tested the inking capabilities by inking a series of straight lines. below, with a straight edge. The pen-tablet interaction on most tablets introduces jitter (wobble) under certain situations, especially when inking slowly on a diagonal. The Surface Pro 8 offered an exceptional inking experience, though I don&rsquo;t think the Surface Pro 9 (5G) is as good, as there seems to be more jitter when inking slowly and diagonally, which is where it creeps in. There&rsquo;s no noticeable ink offset, though, as the ink &ldquo;flows&rdquo; directly underneath the nib.</p>



<p>Again, Microsoft seems to have oversold the haptic feedback. When inking on the tablet your fingers should receive a bit of resistance, like inking on paper, I really couldn&rsquo;t feel it.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 9 (5G) ink test" class="wp-image-1360523" height="876" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/null.png" width="1024" /><figcaption>It appears that the ink jitter in the Surface Pro 9 (5G) is more pronounced than what we found in our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/538941/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review.html">Surface Pro 8 review</a>. </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="cellular-performance">Cellular performance</h2>



<p>One of the selling points of the Surface Pro 9 (5G) is its ability to connect on the go. Microsoft provides two options: either you can insert a physical SIM card into the back of the tablet, via a pop-out door that also houses the replaceable SSD, or you can sign up with one of two built-in eSIM providers and use that instead. If you choose the latter (as I did), you don&rsquo;t need a physical SIM card at all. That&rsquo;s certainly the more convenient option.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s the most effective. I signed up for a 1Gbyte, 7-day eSIM plan with GigSky, one of the built-in providers, for $9.99. Neither GigSky nor Ubigi, the other provider, offer 5G connectivity&mdash;unfortunate considering this SP9 includes &ldquo;5G&rdquo; in its name. There&rsquo;s also no obvious provision to save your GigSky password via the browser, and I hadn&rsquo;t installed a password manager.</p>



<p>Across my test sites, I received decent connectivity, but not quite up to snuff to a Samsung Galaxy S22 5G phone. In two locations with middling to poor signal quality, the eSIM not only failed to connect but asked me to activate the eSIM again, <em>after</em> I&rsquo;d paid for and actually used the eSIM at another location in town.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 9 (5G)" class="wp-image-1359609" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoom-on-slot.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>We&rsquo;re told that these &ldquo;stripes&rdquo; are antenna bands that are used to improve reception, though it wasn&rsquo;t that great on our tests.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>I received a maximum of 268Mbits down and 1.69Mbits up within sight of the cellular tower, and progressively worse results elsewhere &mdash; 132 Mbits and 76Mbits. That&rsquo;s not that shabby, and more than enough to work or stream a movie, as I did. Otherwise, without a 5G offering, and with middling bandwidth, I&rsquo;d be tempted to look into what my provider would offer to wirelessly tether my phone, or what it would cost for a secondary physical SIM.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 9 (5G)" class="wp-image-1359608" height="969" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/SIM-slot-closed.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Pop this SIM cubby open with a SiM tool and you can insert a physical SIM card inside.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<h2 class="toc" id="how-good-is-the-surface-pro-9-5g-performance">How good is the Surface Pro 9 (5G) performance?</h2>



<p>The short answer? Not that bad, surprisingly.</p>



<p>Normally, we&rsquo;d use a standard suite of benchmarks to evaluate the Surface Pro 9 (5G). But the fact that there&rsquo;s an Arm chip inside complicates matters. While the SQ3 Arm chip runs most applications, it doesn&rsquo;t run all of them, and it&rsquo;s this unexpected &ldquo;What? <em>Really</em>?&rdquo; response that can still turn off potential buyers. </p>



<p>For most common applications, though the Surface Pro 9 (5G) should run most everything you&rsquo;d throw at it: Office apps, Microsoft Edge and competing browsers, even the nitty-gritty apps like the Windows Command Line app. (Earlier versions didn&rsquo;t always do this.) Just don&rsquo;t expect to play games; the tablet &ldquo;will not install some games and CAD software, and some third-party drivers or antivirus software,&rdquo; according to Microsoft&mdash;games with OpenGL 1.2 or above or with anti-cheat software, essentially.</p>



<p>Streaming our test 4K60 test YouTube stream looked gorgeous on the tablet&rsquo;s screen, thanks to the great color fidelity. But YouTube only delivered a 1440&times;810 stream, though it didn&rsquo;t drop a single frame. The Netflix and Hulu apps worked as expected. You can download and run Google Chrome, if you&rsquo;d like.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;d normally provide links to comparative tablets, but there really aren&rsquo;t any right now. We can recommend reading our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1067660/lenovo-thinkpad-x13s-gen-1-laptop-review.html">review of the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s Gen 1</a>, which uses the 8cx Gen 3 and should be roughly comparable to the Surface Pro 9 (5G) and its SQ3 chip. We don&rsquo;t have the Surface Pro 9 with a Core chip inside of it to compare to.</p>

<p>Normally, we&rsquo;d test our suite of benchmarks that measures general day-to-day app performance, with CPU tests, and so on. But some of those applications still won&rsquo;t work on Arm.</p>



<p>Therefore, we&rsquo;re forced to play the junior varsity: a PCMark 10 Apps test suite by Underwriter Laboratories that measures how well the tablet loads and uses Microsoft Office apps; a related UL test, 3DMark, which tracks 3D performance; and a browser-based benchmark that tries to fill in the gaps in how well the tablet will handle other applications. </p>



<p>One of our test applications that <em>has</em> run previously, PCMark 8&rsquo;s Creative workload, simply refused to run after numerous attempts. It&rsquo;s one of the frustrations of this platform. </p>



<p>But there has been a surprising amount of improvement in the Snapdragon infrastructure. Again, it&rsquo;s unclear whether or not that our limited test suite is just topping out in terms of theoretical performance, but we were surprised at how well Snapdragon caught up and even exceeded a Core chip.</p>



<p>Case in point: WebXPRT 3. It&rsquo;s a legacy Web app, even passed over by the developer in favor of a new version. WebXPRT performs photo editing, spreadsheet work, digital scanning, and so on, using tools like Web Workers and Javascript. And yes, it topped the Surface Laptop 5, Microsoft&rsquo;s clamshell notebook that uses the 12th-gen Core (Alder Lake) chip.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop 5G WebXPRT 3" class="wp-image-1360435" height="591" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/WebXPRT-3.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Though we have a limited set of comparative laptops, the Surface Pro 9 (5G) is keeping up with Microsoft&rsquo;s latest.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Here&rsquo;s a more compelling benchmark. If you think of the Surface Pro 9 (5G) as primarily an office machine, running Microsoft 365 (Office) apps and browsing the web &mdash; well, that&rsquo;s what the PCMark 10 Apps test measures. And the Surface Pro 9 (5G) holds its own.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop 5G PCMark 10 Apps" class="wp-image-1360438" height="628" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/PCMark-10-Apps.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>In PCMark 10 Apps, there&rsquo;s only a 14 percent gap in performance between the Surface Pro 8 and its Core chip to the Surface Pro 9 (5G) and its Arm processor.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Finally, we used 3DMark&rsquo;s Night Raid, a cross-platform 3D GPU test, to evaluate how the Adreno 3D core inside the SQ3 fares. Here, it doesn&rsquo;t quite hold up to the Iris Xe cores used within the Intel Core chips. There&rsquo;s a significant gap, but it&rsquo;s not extraordinarily huge, either.</p>



<p>Because of some benchmark database snafus, we weren&rsquo;t able to directly compare the Lenovo ThinkPad x13s Gen 1 (a clamshell that uses the comparable Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 processor from Qualcomm) except for this test. The scores are almost exactly equal.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop 5G 3DMark Night raid" class="wp-image-1360437" height="610" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/3DMark-Night-raid.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Adreno graphics core from Microsoft and Qualcomm can&rsquo;t really keep up with the Iris Xe integrated GPUs of Core chips, but that&rsquo;s not really the point of the Surface Pro 9 (5G)</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Battery life is certainly a key metric, too, and we use a video rundown test to measure how long the tablet will last when you use it in class, in meetings, and on the couch. We believe that our tests more directly correspond to real-world usage, as our test conditions use a much brighter screen than Microsoft itself does. This is where Arm processors typically shine, as the Surface Pro 9 (5G) does here with about 15.75 hours of real-world battery life.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop 5G battery life" class="wp-image-1360436" height="621" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Battery-life-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>We turn the Wi-Fi and cellular radios off for this test, which will affect your battery life, as will the work you perform on it. But this is still a great result.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<h2 class="toc" id="should-you-buy-the-surface-pro-9-5g">Should you buy the Surface Pro 9 (5G)?</h2>



<p>We didn&rsquo;t extensively test the Microsoft&rsquo;s tablet for compatibility with modern applications due to time constraints, and that&rsquo;s traditionally been the weakest point of the Arm argument. You can see that we struggled to get some of our benchmark applications to work, and we&rsquo;re not going to award an Editor&rsquo;s Choice award based upon that.</p>



<p>But the thrust of Windows on Arm has always been the core applications, namely Microsoft 365/Office and web browsing, and how they run. All of those load and run as expected. Battery life, the other selling point, has been somewhat superseded by Intel&rsquo;s Evo platform &mdash; by convincing laptop makers to build their clamshells a little thicker and with more battery, they easily extended their run time.</p>



<p>As a tablet, the Surface Pro 9 (5G) sits within a niche, without the ravenous competition of the clamshell notebook space. That gives it breathing room. But, excuses aside, it&rsquo;s now within striking distance of mainstream Core products. We don&rsquo;t have the Surface Pro 9 and its Intel Core processor to test, but the Surface Laptop 5 stands in. The tablet&rsquo;s battery-life argument holds up, and yes, you can argue that you can trade off a bit of lower performance for improved connectivity.</p>



<p>So yes, the Surface Pro 9 (5G) did unexpectedly well. We&rsquo;re impressed. Is it the best tablet in its class? We don&rsquo;t know. But yes, we&rsquo;d recommend that you consider the Surface Pro 9 (5G), and hope for continued competition from Microsoft and Qualcomm in the future.</p>

What can you do to cool them down? Well, there are a few options&hellip;and Adam&rsquo;s going to run through them all. He&rsquo;s got a brand new <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.falcon-nw.com/desktops/talon&amp;xcust=2-1-1358727-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Falcon Northwest Talon machine</a> packing a Ryzen 9 7900X CPU and a Radeon RX 6950 XT, and he&rsquo;s ready to try a few tricks in the latest PCWorld YouTube video. </p>



<p>In addition to a typical high-end 280mm AIO cooler for the CPU and single exhaust fan, the Falcon Northwest case includes an unconventional smaller cold air intake fan on the rear of the case, feeding fresh air directly to the fans on the graphics card. Combined with the pre-built machine&rsquo;s super-clean cable wiring, it&rsquo;s an interesting technique that requires mounting directly beneath the first PCIe slot, which isn&rsquo;t something you can do without blocking those lower slots. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure><p>But that&rsquo;s nuts and bolts. Adam&rsquo;s testing for performance and temperature included five different CPU setup variables: </p>



<ul><li>Stock configuration (turning off Falcon Northwest&rsquo;s -10 curve optimization tuning) </li><li>Falcon Northwest&rsquo;s base tune of -10 </li><li>Custom-tuned -28 curve, near to the minimum possible -30 undervolt setting </li><li>Manual temperature limit of 85 Celsius </li><li>The most aggressive test: combining a -28 curve tune and hard 85&deg; C limit</li></ul><p>Adam found that AMD&rsquo;s curve optimizer tool didn&rsquo;t make a huge difference in CPU temperature under standard testing loads like Cinebench, PugetBench, TimeSpy Extreme, and various high-end games. That held true even with a tune of -28, very near the minimum setting that the tool will allow with the Ryzen 7000 hardware. It&rsquo;s much less effective than we&rsquo;ve seen with older Ryzen hardware, despite the fine showing by the Falcon overall. If you want to lower temperatures without taking a dramatic hit to performance, the easiest and most straightforward solution is to set a hard temperature limit, regardless of the curve setting. </p>



<p>Stick around until the end of the video to see the reveal of a custom Falcon Northwest case panel, and Gordon&rsquo;s reaction &mdash; it&rsquo;s worth the wait.
