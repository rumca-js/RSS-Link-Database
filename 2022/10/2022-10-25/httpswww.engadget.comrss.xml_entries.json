Bayonetta is the ringmaster, of course, and she shows up out of the blue with boxcars of strange beasts, weird friends, dangerous spells, magnificent clothing and endless promises to impress. Her stories don\u2019t always make sense, but they\u2019re filled with melodrama and action, magic and gunfire, and once Bayonetta enters the spotlight, there\u2019s no looking away. Especially not when she\u2019s dancing her way through a spell in an outfit made of her own hair, while 40-storey monsters fight to the death at her back.</p><p><em>Bayonetta 3</em> is full of classic Bayonetta madness, all of it amped up by one degree. The stakes are higher than they\u2019ve ever been, the enemies are absolutely massive, Bayonetta\u2019s magic is incredibly powerful, her outfits are outstanding, and the fights don\u2019t stop coming. A loose plot holds the entire game together \u2013 an army of man-made bioweapons called Homonculi is threatening the existence of the multiverse \u2013 but it\u2019s just an excuse to throw Bayonetta and friends into an endless string of battles in a variety of crumbling cities. In that way, <em>Bayonetta 3</em> isn\u2019t very different from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, though PlatinumGames\u2019 latest installment has way more witchcraft, silliness and shoe-operated guns than anything helmed by Robert Downey Jr.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"undefined\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Structurally and mechanically, <em>Bayonetta 3</em> is as rich as its predecessors. Bayonetta acquires new skills and weapons throughout her quest; she collects fragments of fallen enemies to purchase items, consumables and accessories in the Gates of Hell shop, while orbs unlock abilities on her skill tree. Combat is all about performing stylish combos and executing well-timed dodges, and each fight is infinitely replayable if you\u2019re chasing high scores. There are also plenty of challenges and secrets to find in each level.</p><p><em>Bayonetta 3</em> is a Switch exclusive, and it struggles as much as any fast-paced action game on that console: At times, inputs feel sluggish and it becomes difficult to track which moves are actually lined up. The game does a fine job of providing visual indicators for attacks and there is a rhythm to be found in the fray, but the entire thing runs in Switch Reaction Time (does not adhere to daylight saving).</p><p>For fans of the series, there\u2019s nothing missing in <em>Bayonetta 3</em> \u2013 in fact, there\u2019s just <em>more</em>. More weirdness, more one-liners, more swag, and more combat mechanics. For instance, one section puts players in control of Bayonetta\u2019s witchy buddy, Jeanne, for a side-scrolling action sequence with 1960s espionage flair. Another mechanic allows Bayonetta to control time in short bursts, at times reverting to her younger self. Throughout the game, the Demon Masquerade ability adds hellish features to Bayonetta\u2019s weapons and allows her to transform into various demons, while the Demon Slave skill allows her to summon and control giant creatures of hell, each with a specific moveset.</p><p>Most of Bayonetta\u2019s demons are inspired by classically spooky animals like moths and spiders, but one of her forms is a literal train. A little over halfway through the game, Bayonetta is infused with the energy of Satan\u2019s choo-choo and she\u2019s able to summon a hellish tank engine during fights. Attacking as the train with Demon Slave slows down time temporarily, allowing players to quickly draw a track and indicate points of damage along the route, ideally in the path of nearby enemies. Let go of the Demon Slave button and the train barrels down the ghost track in real time, dealing hefty damage to anything it hits. Bayonetta also acquires the ability to turn into a literal train-witch hybrid through Demon Masquerade, rushing forward with heavy-duty chainsaw-like attacks. Because of course she does.</p><figure><img alt=\"Bayonetta 3\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/bd5db3f0-53ee-11ed-8373-d6552b9bc5ac\" style=\"height: 1080; width: 1920;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nintendo/PlatinumGames</div></figure><p>By the time the train demon appears, it actually fits into the rest of the game nicely. Bayonetta\u2019s world has always been wacky, and <em>3</em> is no exception. If you can handle the idea of Umbra Witches and bartending angels, you can deal with some light locomotive play.</p><p>I don\u2019t take Bayonetta games too seriously and this feels like the right move, especially after playing the third installment. The series\u2019 sense of combat is rich and its storyline is incredibly intricate, involving divine wars and parallel universes, and yet it all just feels like an excuse to make Bayonetta dance her way through a spell while massive monsters fight in the background. Thankfully, this is the best part of the series \u2013 Bayonetta is powerful and fighting in her (gun)shoes feels great, but her personality is what makes this franchise a cult hit. Bayonetta is confident, sarcastic and always correct; her outfits are stunning and so are her friends; she dances like an angel; she never has a hair out of place and her one-liners never stop. She\u2019s a drag queen in a universe loosely held together by witchcraft, and the chaos of this combination is truly magical.</p><p><em>Bayonetta 3</em> is ridiculous and slightly disjointed, but that's precisely what makes it so wonderful. It builds on a multiverse of weird and witchy ideas, and it delivers exactly what fans of the series expect \u2013 something totally unexpected.</p><figure><img alt=\"Bayonetta 3\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/bcb92f30-53f1-11ed-aeff-bc131fdd8a4d\" style=\"height: 854; width: 1104;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nintendo/PlatinumGames</div></figure><p></p>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-testing-out-the-refreshed-entry-level-i-pad-111534902.html?src=rss", "title": "The Morning After: Testing out Apple's new entry-level iPad", "date_published": "2022-10-25 11:15:34+00:00", "description": "<p>Apple surprised us last week with two new iPads. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-2022-refresh-preview-130006762.html\">We\u2019ve spent a bit of time</a> with the new entry-level iPad ($449) which has been redesigned to match the rest of the iPad family with flat edges, USB-C and a Touch ID-enabled power button.

However, when we tested an early prototype, we didn\u2019t get to see how all that came together, software-wise. Now, we got to test the bike along with its companion app and some of its unique ideas. Thanks to the 4G radio, you should get a log of your ride in the app every single time you go out.

According to the FTC, the alcohol delivery service that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/uber-buys-drizly-alcohol-delivery-service-145942834.html\">Uber had purchased</a> in 2021 and its chief executive, James Cory Rellas, were alerted to security issues way back in 2018. The commission has found that they had failed to adequately protect their users' information, which enabled a data breach in 2020 that exposed the data of 2.5 million users.</p><p>Based on the FTC's original complaint, a Drizly employee posted the company's logins for its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud account on GitHub in 2018. Drizly stores users' details, such as their emails, postal addresses, phone numbers, and even their unique device identifies, geolocation info and any other data purchased from third parties that can be linked back to them on AWS. Hackers were able to use those logins to infiltrate Drizly's servers and use them to mine cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>While Drizly took back control by changing its login information, the FTC says it failed to implement \"reasonable safeguards\" to protect its users and to address its security issues despite publicly claiming that it had done so. In 2020, a hacker was able to get into an employee's account and access the company's GitHub. They then hacked into Drizly's database and stole the personal information of 2.5 million customers, which had since been offered for sale on at least two different websites on the dark web.</p><p>The FTC says those events were made possible by Drizly's poor security practices, such as not requiring employees to use two-factor for GitHub, where it stored login information. Drizly also didn't limit workers' access to users' personal data, the FTC adds, and had no senior executive overseeing its security practices.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the FTC's proposed orders, Drizly will have to destroy any personal data it previously collected that's not necessary to be able to provide its services. It will also have to refrain from collecting unnecessary data in the future and will have to publicly divulge the information it requires from users on its website. In addition, it will have to implement a comprehensive security program and appoint an executive to oversee its operations.&nbsp;</p><p>The commission has also issued orders that personally apply to Rellas due to the role he played in presiding over Drizly's lax security practices. If Rellas decides to leave the alcohol deliver service, he will still be required to implement an information security program at future companies where he takes on the role of a CEO, majority owner or senior executive involved in security. As <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/10/24/ftc-drizly-privacy-violations/\"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> notes, the FTC rarely singled out executives in similar security breach cases in the past, and this indicates a new approach at handling companies with inadequate security measures.</p><p>Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>\"Our proposed order against Drizly not only restricts what the company can retain and collect going forward but also ensures the CEO faces consequences for the company\u2019s carelessness. CEOs who take shortcuts on security should take note.\"</p></blockquote><p>The FTC will publish these proposed orders soon, and they will be open for public comment for 30 days before the commission decides if will make them official.</p><div id=\"e7166b916d7941bfb2de2efa7c7cd834\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">1. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@FTC</a> has taken action against <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Drizly?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Drizly</a> (a subsidiary of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Uber?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Uber</a>) and its CEO James Cory Rellas for security failures that led to a data breach exposing the personal information of around 2.5 million consumers. <a href=\"https://t.co/jQCtn9DU4C\">https://t.co/jQCtn9DU4C</a></p>\u2014 Lina Khan (@linakhanFTC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/linakhanFTC/status/1584642930647928833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 24, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p></p>", "favourite": false}]
