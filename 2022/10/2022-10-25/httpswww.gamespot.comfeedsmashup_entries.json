Directed and written by Zach Cregger (The Whitest Kids U'Know), the film received a lot of acclaim when it was released, and now that it's available digitally, you can watch the movie from the comfort--and safety--of your own home. The digital release also includes some bonus features, including deleted scenes, and in one of them, we get to see an exceptionally gross moment that's described below.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Warning: There are some mid-movie spoilers for Barbarian below.</strong></em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Barbarian takes place in an Airbnb. Tess (Georgina Campbell) rents out a house in Detroit while interviewing for a job and finds the house is double-booked as Keith (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) is already staying there. The two decide to share the place, and from there, the movie takes some wild twists and turns.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-barbarians-deleted-scenes-is-gag-inducing/1100-6508618/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-halloween-event-skins-twitch-drops-and-more-in-halloween-terror-2022/1100-6508617/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Overwatch 2 Halloween Event - Skins, Twitch Drops, And More In Halloween Terror 2022", "date_published": "2022-10-25 19:29:00+00:00", "description": "<p>A few weeks after the launch of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/\">Overwatch 2</a>, the game's first special event, Halloween Terror 2022, has begun. This event, which runs from October 25 to November 8, features the return of the Junkenstein's Revenge PvE arcade mode along with some new spooky skins. During the event players can also earn some free rewards in addition to the new items in the shop. From October 25 to November 1 players can also earn a legendary Winston skin by watching Overwatch 2 creators with drops enabled on Twitch.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Junkenstein's Revenge</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Junkenstein's Revenge is a PvE horde mode-style event, where four players need to defend a castle door against waves of robots and Junkenstein's allies, which consist of AI-controlled versions of Reaper, Junkrat, Roadhog, and more. Blizzard has added new versions and difficulties to the mode over the different Halloween events, so there are a variety of different modes and special challenge modes. The challenge modes provide another tier of difficulty, with options including things like only three heroes or randomized heroes. This year's version has the Wrath of the Bride version, which adds Sombra as an AI enemy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to the achievements that can be unlocked by completing different versions of the mode, there are event challenges that are only available during the Halloween Terror event. These challenges offer up a variety of different rewards, including sprays, voice lines, weapon charms, name cards, and battle pass XP. </p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-halloween-event-skins-twitch-drops-and-more-in-halloween-terror-2022/1100-6508617/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-every-perk-killstreak-mode-and-field-upgrade-at-launch-revealed/1100-6508616/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Call Of Duty Modern Warfare II: Every Perk, Killstreak, Mode, And Field Upgrade At Launch Revealed", "date_published": "2022-10-25 19:05:00+00:00", "description": "<p>The full release of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii/\">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</a> is right around the corner, and now Activision has now <a href=\"https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2022/10/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-II-multiplayer-launch-overview-maps\">detailed</a> everything players can expect from the game's multiplayer suite come launch day.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Currently, players who pre-order Modern Warfare II can get early access to the game's <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-campaign-review-just-like-old-times/1900-6417987/\">single-player campaign</a>.

His main attack fires two balls, which implode in a small radius dealing damage. He can use the Kinetic Grasp to absorb projectiles and convert them into overhealth. He can also throw a rock at enemies to knock them down temporarily. He can slo deploy a large shield, which can mitigate damage before it is destroyed. His ultimate Gravitic Flux sends enemies in a circular radius up into the air before slamming them down, dealing damage.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Sigma abilities</h2><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Hyperspheres: </strong>Launch two charges which implode after a short duration, dealing damage in an area.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-sigma-hero-guide/1100-6508580/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-zarya-hero-guide/1100-6508575/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Overwatch 2 - Zarya Hero Guide", "date_published": "2022-10-25 17:13:00+00:00", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/\">Overwatch 2</a> has finally launched, bringing new modes, maps, and heroes to the hero shooter. It also changes the game to a 5v5, dropping one tank on each team, shifting the meta. While the strategies might be different, Zarya, a tank hero who can deal a ton of damage after mitigating damage, is still quite powerful. Here's how to best use Zarya in Overwatch 2.

The Particle Cannon either shoots a short-ranged beam or can fire projectiles with a bit more range. Zarya has two barrier charges that can be distributed to either teammates or herself. Damage taken by the barriers is converted into energy, which increases the damage output of the Particle Cannon. Her ultimate ability is the Graviton Surge, which fires a projectile that creates a gravity well that pulls enemies into and prevents them from leaving.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Zarya abilities</h2><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Particle Cannon</strong>: Main fire is a short-range linear beam.

Just know that they skew more toward uncanny settings, and are light on the gore and violence due to Roblox's younger audience. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The fun of Roblox is joining a random lobby, shuffling around, and figuring out a game's rules with equally confused strangers. It's like a team project where nobody has done the homework--the ultimate terrifying scenario, just in time for Halloween!</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Of course, you can play some of the games on this list solo with a set group of friends, and perhaps some of the strangers will know how each game works--but those situations are a less harrowing type of fun. Go in blind. Join random servers. Enjoy the chaos.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There's games on this list inspired by urban legends, like 3008 borrowing from the Secure, Protect, Contain wiki and Apeirophobia's direct inspiration from The Backrooms, and also, in no specific order, the following themes: Peppa the Pig, doors, clowns, and supermarkets. Here's six horror games you should check out on Roblox.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Doors</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971658/4053932-doors.jpg\" /><br /><em>Open doors in... Doors</em><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.roblox.com/games/6516141723/DOORS\">Doors</a> is a survival-horror game where, yes, you open an astounding number of doors. In the lobby, there are elevators with the number of players in order to start a game--it could be two or four--and upon getting in with the prerequisite number, the game begins. Your task is to open numbered doors--some that may be locked--and rifle through drawers for keys and other items.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Scattered everywhere are hiding spots, like wooden closets, and you can hide in them when monsters come lurking. However, there's a limit to how long you can stay hidden. If you're in a closet too long, you'll be forcibly ejected and lose health.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3008</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971658/4053933-3008.jpg\" /><br /><em>IKEA workers out for blood.</em><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.roblox.com/games/2768379856/3008-2-71\">3008</a> is set in an uncanny infinite IKEA where IEKA workers will hunt you down in the evening. It's directly inspired by the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3008\">SCP-3008</a> entry in the Secure, Contain, Protect wiki--a huge collaborative, crowd-sourced fictional project consisting of weird and supernatural areas. SCP-3008 so happens to be an IKEA warehouse with trapped civilians and creepy humanoid workers muttering, \"The store is now closed, please exit the building,\" at night.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As a trapped civilian, you have hunger, stamina, and health bars. During the daytime, you can scour the area for health kits and food. Other players can also help you out with their stockpiled resources if they're so inclined.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's very funny to get body slammed by two customer service workers chasing you down, so 3008 is a highly recommended experience.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Apeirophobia</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971658/4053934-apeirophobia.jpg\" /><br /><em>Uncanny valley, but make it corporate</em><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Another uncanny game, <a href=\"https://www.roblox.com/games/10277607801/Apeirophobia-UPDATE-3\">Apeirophobia</a> is a horror game heavily inspired by the internet legend The Backrooms. Each level is set in \"liminal spaces\"--like the first area's infinite office layout--and features hostile entities.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you play alone, it's a bit tedious. But with a group, you'll figure out what triggers enemy detection quicker and how to avoid getting killed, and have an increased amount of manpower to find items. The entities aren't very scary--one of them is a shadow-like humanoid crawling around--but some entities are more uh, aggressive, than others at trying to kill you. Each level is very different, and for The Backroom lore enthusiasts, quite familiar as well.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Mimic</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971658/4053936-themimic.jpg\" /><br /><em>The Mimic has a Halloween mode called Nightmare Circus</em><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.roblox.com/games/6243699076/UPDATE-The-Mimic\">The Mimic</a> (nothing to do with the horror movie of the same name) is based on four Japanese horror stories and urban mysteries. Only the first \"book,\" Control, has been fully released so far (the second book's second chapter is on hold <a href=\"https://www.roblox.com/groups/9482918/CTStudio\">due to development on another game</a>), and it's set in a creepy high school.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There are \"non-canon\" game modes like the recently added Halloween event Nightmare Circus. In it, a murderous clown wants your life, and since you don't want to give it to him, you run around and hide. There are more puzzles and activities to clear Nightmare Circus, but those won't be spoiled here.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Panik</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971658/4053937-panik.jpg\" /><br /><em>Murderous supermarket robot</em><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">This isn't quite as exciting as getting murdered by an Ikea worker, but <a href=\"https://www.roblox.com/games/8511615377/Panik-SKILL-UPDATE\">Panik</a> sets you in a game where you can get hunted down by a Walmart--sorry, Wobmart robot employee. In order to escape Wobmart, you need to gather items specified by the three different scanners across the store in order to successfully escape. A murderous robot employee will be lurking between the aisles, but it's quite easy to avoid it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The multiplayer element is that you can totally play for the corporate America team, and sabotage other players by pushing and sacrificing them to the robot. Or if you really want to do the killing yourself, there's a player mode, in addition to the bot one, where a random player is selected as the Happy the robot.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Piggy</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971658/4053938-piggy.jpg\" /><br /><em>Prey turns predator in Piggy</em><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.roblox.com/games/4623386862/Piggy-MANSION-CHAPTER\">Piggy</a> is like a murderous version of Peppa The Pig. It's another game where players must solve puzzles and find items to escape the map and a murderous Peppa-esque pig character. There's a bot version, a player version, and a third player-slash-bot hybrid setting. In the bot version, a bot gets cast as the villain, and in the player version, a random player is selected as the murderer. In the mixed setting, both a player and bot appear as killers--making the game more difficult.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Piggy also comes with game modes like infection, where if a player gets killed, they join the original killer as a new enemy. There's also the traitor mode in which a player assumes the traitor role and their task is to get every player killed--very much like the imposters in Among Us.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/humble-halloween-sale-features-deathly-good-pc-game-deals/1100-6508603/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Humble Halloween Sale Features Deathly Good PC Game Deals", "date_published": "2022-10-25 16:00:00+00:00", "description": "<p>October is a spooky month, particularly for your wallet thanks to all the game sales currently on.

Full remakes, remasters, and reboots have made the headlines in one of gaming's more underserved genres, with no end in sight. So it's been an exciting change of pace to play <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/signalis/\">Signalis</a>, which is blatantly inspired by landmark franchises like Silent Hill and Resident Evil, but offers its own original horror universe to explore.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Signalis doesn't look exactly like the games that inspired it, but it only takes a short while before a veteran of the genre knows what they're in for. The top-down 2D pixel art isn't a precise callback to its spiritual predecessors, nor is its lack of voice acting, but as soon as you start finding door unlock codes on the back of photos you investigate in your inventory screen, memories of the Raccoon City Police Department or Brookhaven Hospital will inevitably come flooding back.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As its protagonist, the robotic LSTR (pronounced Elster), moves through darkened hallways and abandoned dorm rooms set aboard a futuristic space vessel seeking habitable planets for its dystopian \"Nation\" to conquer; she walks, runs, aims, and carries a gun just like Jill Valentine or another horror alum of the PS1 era. Searching behind every door that isn't \"jammed on the other side\" for her missing human companion, the story unfolds in a way you've likely seen before--as though you're perpetually falling into a world you might not be prepared for, but you can't turn back.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/signalis-review-silent-thrill/1900-6417982/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/signalis-earth-key-how-to-solve-the-blank-key-puzzle/1100-6508606/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Signalis Earth Key - How To Solve The Blank Key Puzzle", "date_published": "2022-10-25 15:59:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Whoever designed the facility in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/signalis/\">Signalis</a> really likes keycards. Nowhere is this more evident than in the hospital area of the game. The surgery room is locked with not one, not two, but five keycards. Each one is marked after one of five classic elements. Searching around the hospital floors will net you <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/signalis-gas-valve-puzzle-guide-how-to-get-the-fire-key/1100-6508130/\">fire</a>, water, air, and gold keys, but earth is nowhere to be found. Try as you might, you will never obtain the <strong>earth key</strong>, as it is inaccessible. However, what you will find is a <strong>blank key</strong>. It\u2019s not going to work in its empty state, but if you follow a process, you can make a mock earth key that works just as well as the real one.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">The blank key</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">The blank key can be found after you complete the water pump puzzle and can descend to the hospital\u2019s flooded lower level. Once you drop down, go south in the flooded hallway. When you reach the end, take the door to the right. Inside, you\u2019ll find some pistol ammunition and the blank key.</p><figure style=\"width: 3840px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1750/17503512/4053924-screen_signalis06.jpg\"><img alt=\"Probably not something you should leave lying around.\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1750/17503512/4053924-screen_signalis06.jpg\" /></a><figcaption>Probably not something you should leave lying around.</figcaption></figure><h2 dir=\"ltr\">The real earth key</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">You\u2019re not quite ready to slot the blank key in the surgery room door yet. First, you need to write the unlock code on it, but before you do that, you need to find out what that code is. To locate the code, you need to find the original keycard, which may sound redundant, but the keycard is lodged in a chunk of something and locked behind glass.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/signalis-earth-key-how-to-solve-the-blank-key-puzzle/1100-6508606/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-trailer-highlights-improvements-to-combat-and-enemies/1100-6508604/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "God Of War: Ragnarok Trailer Highlights Improvements To Combat And Enemies", "date_published": "2022-10-25 15:58:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Ahead of its early November release, a new trailer for <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok/\">God of War: Ragnarok</a> has detailed some of the changes to the sequel's enemy design and combat.</p><p>At the start of Ragnarok, Kratos has both his Leviathan Axe and Blades of Chaos, giving players far more combat options than the start of the previous game.

From the way Bayonetta sashays about the screen--left hand cocked on her hip while the other clutches her gun--to the sheer bombastic nature of the game itself, every part of Bayonetta 3 is unapologetically self-assured. Like the titular witch, Bayonetta 3 feels as if it doesn't much care how it is perceived because it <em>knows</em> its own worth as a game that offers fast and fluid gameplay, jaw-dropping spectacles, comedy, and camp in a way very few others do. And it's hard to argue with that when it's true.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Like its predecessors, Bayonetta 3 is spectacular in the truest sense of the word. Though the game's core gameplay is familiar, it ups the stakes, sending players on a multi-dimensional journey across time to save the world. If that's not enough, this venture also comes with full-scale kaiju battles, exhilarating chase sequences, a new, sword-wielding character who is wildly fun to play as, and a series of 2D stealth-based chapters that follow Jeanne as she infiltrates enemy headquarters.

After introducing the concept of a multiverse filled with other Bayonettas, other Jeannes, and the gut-sinking feeling that everything we do has been done once before, it dives headfirst into its action-packed gameplay. As a supernatural storm overtakes New York City, Bayonetta is forced to take on the homunculi, a new enemy that are neither angel nor demon, and are hellbent on eradicating not only <em>our</em> Bayonetta's universe, but every universe (and every version of Bayonetta) imaginable.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bayonetta-3-review-real-hot-girls-hit/1900-6417989/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-trailer-gets-spooky-with-a-new-ghost-dog-pokemon/1100-6508594/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "New Pokemon Scarlet And Violet Trailer Gets Spooky With Greavard, The New Ghost Dog Pokemon", "date_published": "2022-10-25 13:00:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The Paldean region of Pokemon Scarlet And Violet will be filled with spooky sights, as the game's latest trailer highlights Ghost-type Pokemon including Gengar and a brand-new ghost doggo Pokemon named Greavard that just wants to play fetch.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The trailer shows a Pokemon Trainer searching for Ghost-type Pokemon at night.
