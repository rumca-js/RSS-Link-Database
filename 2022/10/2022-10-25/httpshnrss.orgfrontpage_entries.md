## Tell HN: Cloudflare R2 allows 300PB of egress for chump change

<p>In their official example, 300PB for $104. Cloudflare only charge for the cost of GET operations. Actual "bandwidth" is free. For comparison, Amazon S3 is $90/TB. So, the equivalent cost would be 300,000TB x $90= $27 million.<p>What is the catch? Am I missing something?<p>https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/platform/pricing/</p>

## Launch HN: Paigo (YC S22) – Measure and bill SaaS customers based on usage

<p>Hey HN! Daniel here, I’m a software engineer and hobbyist hacker. I’m joined by my cofounder Matt. We’re building Paigo (<a href="https://paigo.tech" rel="nofollow">https://paigo.tech</a>). We make it easy for SaaS businesses to bill customers based on usage.<p>To get your hands dirty a bit we have a stateless and signupless demo you can try out: shorturl.at/bklAQ and a video of me walking through the system in a bit more detail: <a href="https://youtu.be/T6J1Yh8GhdU" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/T6J1Yh8GhdU</a>.<p>The idea of our platform is fairly straightforward: You give us read-only access to your SaaS backend and based on tenant metadata for your infrastructure, we measure, persist, and aggregate SaaS tenant usage data to give a clear picture of per-client usage. We can measure metrics like API requests, Compute time, Data Storage, Transaction Volumes and many more. Some common scenarios would be: an ML platform could use Paigo to track processed input files for customers, a Data platform could use Paigo to determine the data size customers have consumed, and an API company can use Paigo to track customers’ API requests. Additionally, we also help you understand your cost to serve your clients’ usage, and this data allows us to provide your SaaS with usage based billing.<p>What’s the problem we are solving? Many SaaS products need to measure their customer's usage in some form, and many want to incorporate it into their billing plans. It’s fairly annoying to either build the entire system in house or to build a measurement system in house and then connect to a billing provider. It takes months to get a usage based billing system up and running and usually requires several engineers (if not more) to maintain and operate. Also, when Sales wants to offer specific discounts or deals to major enterprises, it’s typically handled outside of the in-house system in Excel spreadsheets with some good guesses. This is how a lot of money gets lost for major deals.<p>With Paigo we handle 100% of the measurement and collection of SaaS customers’ usage for the business. SaaS business can see their customers’ usage within 10 minutes, because all they need to do is give us read access to their cloud account. Since we pull the lower level infra-data we can additionally give information like per tenant cost, and profit margin.<p>Matt and I came to this project after we built similar internal billing systems at previous jobs and we realized how error-prone these systems can be—one incident might have even undercharged a client by a few million dollars! We also realized there was no solution which integrated directly to a backend system and handled the measurement and gathering of usage data as well as providing the end billing integration to platforms like stripe, AWS marketplace, or through ACH.<p>To get into the technical details Paigo has a few measurement systems to measure different forms of usage data: infrastructure-based, where we connect directly to cloud APIs then to slice-and-dice per tenant usage data; agent-based, where our agent is deployed into a runtime to gather usage like pod cpu time, memory, and file read write, along with any exported metrics that are prometheus compatible; and datastore-based, where we connect directly to datastores like S3, Kinesis, or log file. We require that the data in the datastore based approach adhere to a standard data format so we can process it. However this allows us to Pull, any custom metrics and dimensions directly from your Datastore.  All of this data is then processed and sent to our backend usage journal, where we store it in an append-only ledger pattern.<p>For clients to search, and aggregate their data into an end bill or to slice and dice their client’s cost and usage we have an API clients can use. We’re an API first company, which is why our demo can work with Retool—the demo is just a very thin skin over our API. The API is a NestJS based application, currently running in AWS Lambda with API-Gateway.<p>We bill based on invoiced revenue (surprise surprise its usage based) and we have a platform fee, roughly it breaks down to 1% of invoiced revenue on Paigo. Note that pricing is not currently transparent on our website. Our typical customers are mid-sized enterprises where an initial sales call is typically expected. However, we will be updating our main webpage soon to have some self-service options.<p>For a bit of deeper dive on the measurement engine we have some docs here: <a href="https://docs.paigo.tech/" rel="nofollow">https://docs.paigo.tech/</a><p>Thanks for taking time to read! Let us know what you hate and maybe what you love :P. We’d also love to hear your thoughts and experiences with measuring customer usage and usage-based billing!</p>

## Ask HN: Corp gives “contractor” benefits, want “employee” obligations, what now?
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33330811](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33330811)

<p>I am a remote worker in a country that is not the same one as any of the company offices (they have multiple offices in multiple countries).<p>They hired me as "contractor", but promised I would be treated as employee, to facilitate things legally.<p>Things went good at first, but now they been treating me as contractor regarding rights, but employee regarding what they want from me.<p><pre><code>    - I have no vacation, no paid sick days, no leave, no benefits.
    - One of the owners (he has a huge amount of shares) explicitly told me I will never get a raise, because contractors don't get raises.
</code></pre>
At same time:<p><pre><code>    - I have to work in specific work hours
    - I have a manager that even micromanages my work and keep pestering me whenever I don't reply promptly, can't even go to the bathroom without my phone without this guy noticing.
    - I got a semi-leadership position, I don't have any employees under me but there is a project in the company that I own completely and make all decisions, and whenever someone else screws up on that project I am responsible (even if they don't report to me directly).
    - Whenever a project is late, I have to help and work unpaid overtime (in fact I worked the past months 12+ hour per day including weekends, also having zoom calls with clients 4:00 in the morning is a thing that happened).
</code></pre>
Also despite my speed being faster and faster, with more and more Jira tickets completed, enormous amount of Git commits, and clients being happy with my work, my manager keeps saying I am underperformer.<p>To be honest I wanted to quit, but I am living paycheck to paycheck with zero savings after I had to expend them because of a family member car accident. Other employees been quitting for a while now, company has very high turnover, including losing lead engineers that didn't document their work so many new employees have no idea how the company tech actually works.<p>Also the jurisdiction of my contract is UK, but I don't live in UK, and I am not UK citizen, I am not sure if I even can sue them, or if I was going to sue them, what kind of lawyer I would have to look for.<p>Contract is full of sketchy stuff, like they owning even my personal diary if I wrote in it during my contract, or owning my private correspondence.</p>

<p>I think I’m suffering with burn out and just want to crawl under the covers and come out again in spring, unfortunately I am only half way through my probation period and don’t have an vacation days.<p>I left a long term job about 7 months ago, join another company and very quickly realised I didn’t like the atmosphere so left there for what should have been my dream job, however I’m 4 months in, still in probationary period and think I’m burning out (home, kids, marriage, etc)<p>I’m not sure if to tell my boss, tell the company or how to deal with it, because I can’t afford to loose this job with a family to support.</p>

<p>When Harry (my co-founder) and I started Trevor.io we obviously needed customers.  We'd often bonded over Paul Graham's "Do Things That Don't Scale", so it was a no-brainer that every month, like clockwork, we'd get on that €50 Ryanair flight to London, to spend a week pitching potential customers / partners / anyone who would listen.  We tried as best we could to rotate which lucky friend or family members' sofa we would be sleeping on each time, so as not to out-stay our welcome.<p>One event that we ended up doing again and again was called TechHub Tuesday Demo Night.  It was an epic monthly event (first Tuesday of every month) hosted by the most sought after startup co-working space on London's famous "Silicon Roundabout" (yes, us English can't quite fill a valley yet with our startup scene, but we sure can fill a roundabout!).  The event was an opportunity for up-and-coming startups to show (not tell) what they had built, and get instant feedback from the community.  Importantly, you had to have built something (an app / website / platform / etc.) and, unlike competing events, it wasn't about trying to pitch for investment.  It was a welcoming, enthusiastic audience of fellow entrepreneurs, builders and product lovers.  Pitching your product here was always a buzz.<p>Unfortunately, like many other great ventures, TechHub London was one of the unlucky victims of Covid 19.  In the summer of 2020 they slipped into administration, and with it TechHub Tuesday Demo Night.  We've very much missed it - both presenting and attending - so we have decided to do something about it.<p>We are pumped to announce that next Tuesday we are launching our very own Tuesday Demo Day with a twist:<p>- it will be 100% virtual,
- and 100% free.<p>This means that you can join us from the comfort of your couch.  Bring a beverage of your choice and be ready to be give our startups the feedback and advice they need to take themselves to the next level.<p>We would be absolutely delighted if you would join us (https://hopin.com/events/trevor-demo-day-global).</p>

## Ask HN: What's the next evolution of the GUI OS?

<p>Hi, in the past few years I was thinking about the evolution of OS based on GUI. Right now, we have all these windows and menus and lists. And you've probably noticed there is some uncomfortable limitation. For example, when you're working on some complex task, you can rarely feel the process flowing. You need to open different windows or different programs and go back and forth between them, spending time and mental resources. What can be a better solution to this?<p>What if we remove windows completely? Think about it - when you open a program, you don't actually need a separate window. What you need is functionality! So what if we remove windows and keep only the functionality. For example, you open a .doc file, but there is no separate window. You stay in the same "Desktop", but now you have an open file and functions to work with this file. And if you need some other functions, you open another program - and other functions appear on the desktop. So now you have two different programs working as one! And you don't need to arrange different programs and files on the screen. Because now you can have different programs and files working simultaneously as one.<p>I think that will be an incredible experience! And it will tremendously increase productivity and improve the workflow. If you're interested or have a comment, let's discuss below.</p>

<p>I have used Docker more than almost any other tool, and I have genuinely given it a fair shot. After all of that, I still don't understand the appeal.<p>Docker nearly seems to be an industry standard by now. Some people treat it like an obvious choice, but it's not so obvious to me.<p>People say that Docker can run anywhere. It solves the infamous problem of "works on my machine". Despite what people claim, I have not found this to be the case. I developed containers on windows and then I still had to debug the containers when deploying on Linux. There were formatting issues, filenotfound issues, and chmod issues. I have spent so much time configuring docker, and been able to complete the same task in a VM in a fraction of the time.<p>Am I alone here? Am I doing it wrong? Is it the case that I am not the intended audience, and it's meant for larger teams?</p>
