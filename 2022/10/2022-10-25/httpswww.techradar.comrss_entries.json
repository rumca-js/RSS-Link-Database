Sadly, after six years of development, the project was scrapped. The team \"didn\u2019t want to bite off more than we could chew,\" EA Motive general manager Patrick Klaus told <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-motive-boss-cancellations-in-video-game-development-shouldnt-be-a-taboo-thing\" target=\"_blank\">Eurogamer</a>.\u00a0</p><p>It turned out that the risk associated with such an ambitious project was too much for the relatively young studio to handle. \u201cConsidering you&apos;ve got families... you want to make sure you&apos;ve got sustainability, and you set the teams up for success,\u201d Klaus said. \u201cI take that responsibility of calculated risk-taking very seriously.\"</p><p>Instead of Gaia, EA Motive began work on the much-anticipated Dead Space remake, along with prospects of working on a future Iron Man game. So it wasn\u2019t necessarily a step backwards for the studio.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"back-to-the-drawing-board-xa0-4\">Back to the drawing board \u00a0</h2>\n<p>EA Motive isn\u2019t the first developer to return to the drawing board when developing a game, and it likely won\u2019t be the last. Capcom\u2019s Resident Evil 4 is a great example of this. The iconic survival horror game had gone through massive reworking before its release in 2005.\u00a0</p><p>Resident Evil 4 had three separate prototypes throughout development. These were \u2018Fog\u2019, \u2018Hallucinations\u2019, and \u2018Hook man\u2019, with the last prototype showcased at E3 in 2003. Unfortunately, each one of these ideas was inevitably scrapped by Capcom.</p><p>But that\u2019s not where the story ended. After returning to the drawing board, Capcom repurposed much of the \u2018Fog\u2019 prototype. Initially meant to be a radical departure from the Resident Evil franchise, the prototype became the first Devil May Cry game.</p>\n<figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\"><div class=\"image-full-width-wrapper\"><div class=\"image-widthsetter\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\"><img align=\"middle\" alt=\"A character standing in a big hall\" class=\"\" height=\"1080\" id=\"o633A3R6PqQLLXi8iTfFPf\" name=\"Devil_May_Cry_Switch_Screens02.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o633A3R6PqQLLXi8iTfFPf.jpg\" width=\"1920\" /></p></div></div><figcaption class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\">(Image credit: Capcom)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"good-news-xa0-4\">Good news \u00a0</h2>\n<p>Both Capcom and EA Motive prove that starting again doesn\u2019t have to be a failure. \"Cancellations in video game development shouldn&apos;t be a taboo thing,\" Klaus said. \u00a0\u201cIt&apos;s part of the creative process\u201d.</p><p>Often, it allows developers to improve on existing ideas and get better with time. \u201cDead Space was the first thing in order for us to step up and have more ambition,\u201d Klaus said, \u201cand then with Iron Man, we&apos;ve got the opportunity to take things to a whole new level\".</p><p>There are going to be many pressures on a studio through a game&apos;s development \u2013 budget and time available, in particular. But when a team realizes it is going down a path with a project that won&apos;t end in something it can stand behind, having the freedom and space to start again, can lead to wonderful games.</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/new-callisto-protocol-gameplay-shows-just-how-gory-the-dead-space-successor-is\"><u>New Callisto Protocol gameplay shows just how gory the Dead Space successor is</u></a>\u00a0</li></ul>\n                                                            </article>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.techradar.com/rss", "link": "https://www.techradar.com/news/motorola-razr-2022-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-rival-global-launch/", "title": "Motorola\u2019s Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 rival has finally gone global", "date_published": "2022-10-25 10:41:37+00:00", "description": "The Motorola Razr 2022 has made it beyond China and landed in the UK and Europe.", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.techradar.com/rss", "link": "https://www.techradar.com/news/watch-out-nvidia-amd-might-have-a-turbocharged-gpu-to-rival-the-rtx-4090/", "title": "Watch out, Nvidia - AMD might have a turbocharged GPU to rival the RTX 4090", "date_published": "2022-10-25 10:33:38+00:00", "description": "The rumored graphics card bears the new \u2018XTX\u2019 moniker and could be revealed alongside other Radeon RX 7000 GPUs in November.", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.techradar.com/rss", "link": "https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-is-looking-into-reported-issues-with-rtx-4090-gpu-melting-cable/", "title": "Nvidia is looking into reported issues with RTX 4090 GPU melting cable", "date_published": "2022-10-25 09:53:34+00:00", "description": "Team Green is investigating what happened in a couple of very worrying reports from RTX 4090 owners.", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.techradar.com/rss", "link": "https://www.techradar.com/news/gopro-mysteriously-delays-hero-11-black-mini-so-it-can-perfect-the-action-cam/", "title": "GoPro mysteriously delays Hero 11 Black Mini so it can \u2018perfect\u2019 the action cam", "date_published": "2022-10-25 09:40:26+00:00", "description": "The GoPro Hero 11 Black Mini has been delayed, but the compact action cam will still be available to buy in November.", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.techradar.com/rss", "link": "https://www.techradar.com/news/live/whatsapp-is-down-and-messages-wont-send-heres-what-we-know/", "title": "WhatsApp is down and messages won't send - here's what we know", "date_published": "2022-10-25 08:17:57+00:00", "description": "WhatsApp appears to be down, with messages not sending.
