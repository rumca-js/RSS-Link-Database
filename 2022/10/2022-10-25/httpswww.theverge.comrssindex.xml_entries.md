While you’ve been able to mount one of the satellite dishes onto or outside of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23181342/starlink-rv-review-trees-rain-speed-latency">a stationary vehicle for a while now</a>, it was intended for use only while parked, like at a campsite or remote cabin (though there <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22561264/california-driver-ticket-spacex-starlink-antenna">were those that tried to make it work on the go</a>).

  <p id="DfOKYG">Just when I thought the relationship between Apple and Meta couldn’t get more hostile, here we are.</p>
<p id="JA2lxT">On Monday, Apple quietly <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">updated its App Store rules</a> to require that iOS developers use in-app purchases — and thereby give Apple 30 percent — on “sales of ‘boosts’ for posts in a social media app.” This primarily affects Facebook and Instagram, which let people pay to boost the reach of their posts. It’s the first time Apple has directly taxed advertising in iOS apps.</p>
<p id="knTqN3">Meta, of course, isn’t happy. Company spokesperson Tom Channick sent <em>The Verge</em> the following statement: “Apple continues to evolve its policies to grow their own business while undercutting others in the digital economy. Apple previously said it didn’t take a share of...</p>

  <p id="8ldqcm">Apple’s next major iOS update, iOS 16.2, will let you send a report to the company when Emergency SOS has been triggered on accident, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/10/25/ios-16-2-report-emergency-sos-unintentionally-triggered/">according to <em>9to5Mac</em></a>. That could be a useful way to share data back to Apple if the feature activates, say, after riding a roller coaster.</p>
<p id="MR1p3D">The iPhone 14 lineup includes a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23313786/apple-watch-series-8-specs-price-features-release-date">crash detection feature</a> that activates Emergency SOS if it believes you have been in a car crash and you don’t respond. Emergency SOS contacts emergency services and can send your location to selected contacts, so having it trigger automatically after a crash could be genuinely helpful. It alerted responders to a crash in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nebraska-lincoln-91393ae2a062e16516984f121a39f20a">Lincoln, Nebraska, earlier this month</a>.</p>

Now, this maximalist keyboard is getting even bigger with the addition of a pair of new peripherals. Mountain is giving you the option of adding an additional 12 buttons to your desk setup with its new MacroPad and DisplayPad. </p>
<p id="g4Z9LG">The MacroPad is exactly what it says on the tin, giving you 12 new buttons that you can bind to individual functions or program macros through Mountain’s Basecamp software. Just like Mountain’s keyboards, the MacroPad features hot-swappable switches and addressable RGB lighting.</p>

Just as with other headphones and earbuds, the feature will let you connect to two Bluetooth audio sources at the same time. If you’re listening to music on your laptop and a call comes in on your phone, you can switch to it seamlessly. Sony plans to add multipoint to the LinkBuds and LinkBuds S “by November of 2022.” In a somewhat surprising turn, even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review">the WF-1000XM4s</a> will gain multipoint this winter. </p>

  <p id="wSGzQp">Apple says that it’s fixed the iMessage and FaceTime outage that was causing “message not delivered” errors on Tuesday for about half an hour starting at 11:48AM ET (8:48AM PT). According to the company’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/">system status page</a>, the issue affected “some” users, which lines up with our experience; while one <em>Verge</em> staff member did have issues sending messages, a few others were able to do so during the outage.</p>
<p id="6Yml9M">But there were <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/imessage/">thousands of reports</a> that the service wasn’t working on Downdetector.

  <p id="2S0B3J">Microsoft announced during a 25th-anniversary celebration of <em>Age of Empires</em> that the latest game, <em>Age of Empires IV</em>, is coming to consoles next year. It will launch on day one on Xbox Game Pass, and it will be playable via Xbox Cloud Gaming for those who prefer to play on portable devices. The game launched in late 2021 for PC, and it has been available since then for PC Game Pass subscribers, but this is a great opportunity for console gamers to check it out.</p>
<p id="6tivTh">In case you missed out on the PC release or you’ve just been waiting patiently for news on this port, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22375911/age-of-empires-4-history-lesson-documentary-footage-music-languages">my colleague Mitchell Clark has some fun coverage</a> from last year on the impressive lengths that Microsoft and World’s Edge (the studio focused on <em>Age of Empires</em>) went to give...</p>

  <p id="JZf5v8">There are many reasons why you might want to factory reset your smartwatch. Perhaps an update got borked during download and no amount of troubleshooting has helped. Maybe you want to upgrade to a new model and plan to gift your current watch to a friend. Apple requires you to do it if you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23042586/apple-watch-passcode-reset-how-to">happen to forget your passcode</a>. Or, it’s possible that smartwatches just aren’t your thing and you’re ready to sell. </p>
<p id="DxdsYy">Whatever the reason, it’s important that you wipe the data from your device. Wearables are personal devices and store a ton of sensitive data — especially if you primarily use your smartwatch for health and fitness tracking. As a general reminder, if you’re not totally throwing in the towel on smartwatches, it’s a good idea to back up...</p>

The earbuds are marked with a status of “final sale” <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/earbuds/sport-open-earbuds.html#ProductTabs_tab999" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">and are being steeply discounted</a> on Bose’s online store, and Bose spokesperson Joanne Berthiaume confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that this is the end of the line for the product. </p>
<p id="qcMzas">The $199.99 earbuds — now available for $119.99 while supplies last — were marketed as “a truly different kind of sport headphone” upon their release. They don’t actually go into your ear canals or even block them in any way. But rather, the unique open-style design lets them rest above your ears and allows for total situational awareness while listening to music. </p>
