<p><em>Dear Craig,</em></p><p><em>Our company uses many IoT devices across our global network. But we have struggled to get visibility into how these devices are performing until it affects our bottom line and reduces our productivity. My team wants to proactively identify issues early before they snowball into bigger problems. Is there a simplified, cost-effective way to track all these devices in the network, monitor their performance and detect abnormal behavior?</em></p><p>– <em>A Reader</em></p><p>Dear Reader,</p><p>Check out <a href="https://www.vmware.com/content/microsites/eni/home.html" rel="nofollow">VMware Edge Network Intelligence</a>™ — a key component of <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/secure-access-service-edge-sase.html" rel="nofollow">VMware SASE</a>™ — which gives enterprise IT teams the necessary visibility to be proactive instead of reactive.

## Got a Google Pixel Watch? Get this watch face

<p>I'll admit it: I've really been diggin' Google's purty new Pixel Watch.</p><p>I've been wearing the watch for the past few weeks, bathing and slumber-time notwithstanding, and here's the twist: I absolutely did <em>not</em> expect to enjoy it.</p><p>I was actually really into Wear OS and Google's smartwatch odyssey early on, too, way back when <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2852389/moto-360-android-wear-revisited.html">the platform first came out</a> in the prehistoric era of 2014. But then, well, a couple things happened:</p><ol>
<li>I reached a point where I wanted the ability to be less tethered to technology, and wearing a smartwatch made me <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3147429/why-i-stopped-wearing-a-smartwatch.html">feel perpetually on the grid</a> and tied to my electronic obligations.</li>
<li>Google gave up on its thoughtfully conceived original vision for wearables, with a focus on contextual info and glanceable nuggets, and instead <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3265051/google-is-often-its-own-worst-enemy.html">started chasing Apple's more popular philosophy</a> — with an emphasis on complicated standalone apps and intricate interactions. That stuff looks impressive in ads but doesn't make for a great real-world experience in my eyes, and it just didn't jibe with the way I wanted to use a watch.</li>
</ol>
<p>So suffice it to say, I assumed my journey with the new Pixel Watch would be an interesting technological diversion but a short-lived adventure I'd be eager to abandon.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3677495/google-pixel-watch-face.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
