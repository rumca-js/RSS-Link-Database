	You feel for this poor schlub. All he wanted to do was see some naked girls. Instead, as this video grows more viral, he's going to be the subject of ridicule from his boys for the rest of his life. I was not surprised to know the incident took place in Upstate New York. They go hard in Upstate America.
</p><p>
	Our story takes place outside the nudie bar. Where the breast may be fake, but boy do they shake...

</blockquote></div><blockquote>Hey bro, I'm going to ask you one more time. Do you wanna go to the strip club, or do you wanna go home buddy?</blockquote><p>If I had a dollar for every time I had to be asked that, I'd wind up giving it to someone girl from Schenectady who thinks I believe she's working her way through med school.</p><p>My dude played his Saturday night all wrong. You are supposed to get sh*tfaced when you get <em>TO</em> the strip club. This guy started off drunk AT HOME. He decided he wanted to go to the nudie bar, where you see their butt and their trap stays shut. But, it would appear, all those shots of Tito's caught up to him and he blacked out in the back of an Uber.</p><p>And the police had to get involved TWICE! Once when they pulled the car over and attempted to talk to the dude. Then, when the Uber driver drove him home and gave him options, he was too drunk to choose any options. So the police got called back.</p><p>Not a day goes by I don't thank God there were no Ubers or social media during my blackout-drunk days. It's going to stink for this guy when this video resurfaces as he's running for the Assembly.</p><p>

## Twitter attacks Ice Cube for "criticizing" the Biden Admin, and the rapper is hitting back HARD

Users were outraged over a video of the rapper criticizing the Biden Administration for not reaching out about his "Contract with Black America." Even worse, he suggested black voters not give their blind allegiance to the Democratic Party. </p><p>For Cube to say these things less than two weeks before the midterm elections was worse than getting f*cked out of your green with no Vasoline.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">When did Black America appoint Ice Cube our represenative?

He looked to discuss his plan with both sides. Only the Republican side sat down with him. Everyone got pissed about that. Not that Democrats wouldn't meet with Cube. They were pissed that Cube met with the GOP. <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-ice-cube-cnn-and-chris-cuomo-cant-handle-the-truth-20201015-wv3nmfq33ffk7ifgl3glvgbkau-story.html" target="_blank">White liberals felt the need to whitesplain how to be a black guy to him</a>.</p><p>From the interview that is trending on Twitter, today, October 26, 2022:</p><blockquote>People are used to seeing black people go on one side to the democratic party.

If the one side you're engaging with doesn't respond.</blockquote><p>It's good advice for all people to listen to.

</p><p>Black Twitter was not in the mood to hear this from Ice Cube as we're less than two weeks before the midterms. Here's the rub... these comments weren't from today. They were from 2021. Some dude uploaded them today, and everyone is getting upset by it, causing Ice Cube to trend.</p><p>The least amused about it is Ice Cube. He's been hitting back.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Stop lying to the people. This was done in 2021 you jack-ass.

There are going to be articles written, not about the shady way someone on Twitter attempted to use an old video to either affect the news OR so others pay attention to the users on Twitter. The article will be about how Ice Cube was upset by it and pushed back, instead of begging for forgiveness over the sin of having a different opinion last year.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Crowd ROARS when Kari Lake tells her Democrat opponent what she can go do to a bull

Yes, I know the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website is beginning to resemble a Kari Lake stan blog as of late. It's because <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kari-lake-volunteer-research" target="_blank">we stan Kari Lake</a>, and saucy clips like this are why.</p><p>Lakes was discussing the issue of gender. Kari Lake believes there are only two genders. Her opponent Katie Hobbs, allegedly, believes there are forty-seven genders. I say allegedly because Hobbs has been running from a debate with Lake like a rodeo clown when they let Dirty Sancho out of the chute. If Hobbs believes there are less than forty-seven genders, a debate would clarify that.</p><p>All we have is Kari's accusation. Also, her suggestion on what Hobbs can do if she feels that way.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">. <a href="https://twitter.com/KariLake?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@KariLake</a>: ‚ÄúKatie Hobbs thinks there are 47 different genders.

</p><p>You see, in the animal world, there is a confirmed only two genders. Same in the people world, but... you know. </p><p>There are bulls and there are cows. Cows are female. They have udders and if you pull on them, milk comes out.</p><p>Bulls are male. They have one singular "udder" and if you pull on it... you don't get milk. Though you may get happy bull.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="a2dad" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32005441&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>As of this writing, Lake has a 1.5% polling lead according to RCP. At this point in the campaign, it would be near impossible to have a debate even if Hobbs wasn't chicken. We'll have to leave it to our imaginations how Katie would have responded had Lake issued to bull challenge in an official debate capacity.</p><p><p>

## Fetterman campaign tries blaming closed captioning for disastrous debate, but the company hits back hard

It's because they knew he was going to look as horrible as he did Yeah, he had a stroke. That's why he should have dropped out before the PRIMARY! Not hid how bad he was from voters until they'd been voting for two weeks. Though in the campaign's defense, they blame the closed captioning. The closed captioning that Fetterman needed to barely function.</p><p>First, some highlights. Because what the campaign lacked in human dignity, it made up for in content.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">What just happened? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PASen?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PASen</a> <a href="https://t.co/aJRDZVFU2x">pic.twitter.com/aJRDZVFU2x</a><br />‚Äî RNC Research (@RNCResearch) <a href="https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1585066967869796352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">FETTERMAN: "How can a man, you know, with with 10 gigantic mansion has am willing to talk about willing wage for anybody?

It's the closed captioning's fault: "We are thrilled with John‚Äôs performance.

The closed captioning process functioned as expected during rehearsal and again during tonight‚Äôs debate.</blockquote><p>Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) should be ashamed they let things with Fetterman gets this far. Someone should have stepped in and had him bow out before the DEMOCRAT PRIMARY. Instead, they thought they could hide and/or cover for him until he won. Then, and only then, would "Fetterman" decide he had to resign the office for health reasons.</p><p>If the left had any self-respect, they would feel bad about themselves. But they still parade Joe Biden out there. So obviously, they don't.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Podcaster makes explosive claim about LeBron James cheating on his wife, forcing girls to sign NDAs

It's the most explosive LeBron <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/scooby-doo-velma-video-game" target="_blank">drama since Velma had him arrested in a video game</a>.

</p><p>No, I did not know LeBron James was a cheater. And over-actor when he is flopping around on the court, sure. But a man who would sully the sanctity of his marriage?  I am both shocked and awed by this explosive allegation.</p><p>I also don't understand the point of the non-disclosure agreements. It makes sense from LeBron's standpoint. But the entire point of hooking up with celebrities is so you can brag about it to people. Otherwise, it's just meaningless sex, and you can get that anywhere.</p><p>There's a healthy dose of "whoa, if true" to this. Mind you, I'm not making the allegation. Someone else is and the internet is talking about it. I'm only making sure you're all informed as to what the internet is saying. You know, in case it comes up at work or something.</p><p>Due to the popularity of the podcast, James is going to have to respond to the allegations. It's a shame. LeBron, even though he'll never be as good as Michael Jordan, is otherwise <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kyle-rittenhouse-lebron-james-response" target="_blank">such an upstanding</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lebron-freedom-russia" target="_blank">respectful American citizen</a>. I would hate to find out he was an adulterer.</p><p><p>

## 'Fighting for our bikini rights': Judge rules in favor of girls serving you coffee while scantily dressed

But a district court ruled that it is every woman's God-given right to serve coffee while barely having their chesticles and hoo-ha covered. God bless America.</p><p>First, a little backstory. In Everett, Washington, the city passed a dress code targeting "bikini baristas" in 2017. In this 2019 clip, a bikini barista details her fight for her bikini rights</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit">
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeCOS7l_Wfw" target="_blank">www.youtube.com</a>
</small>
</p><p>The ordinance banned workers in the service industry, such as bikini baristas, from showing off certain body parts: their stomachs, backs, and three inches of the legs below the buttocks. It wasn't for food safety. The City passed the laws citing female exploitation and, quote, "adverse impacts upon minors."</p><p>Funny, because we're talking about a Biden voting area of the Pacific Northwest. Had they been bikini drag queens at a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/family-friendly-school-board" target="_blank">family-friendly</a> coffee stand, the city would not have had a problem. Let alone, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dancers-chattanooga-brewery" target="_blank">any concern</a> for the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ana-navarro-rants-ron-desantis" target="_blank">adverse impacts upon minors</a>. But that's neither here nor there.</p><p>A district court ruled that <a href="https://reason.com/2022/10/25/bikini-baristas-win-lawsuit-over-unconstitutional-dress-code/" target="_blank">the city ordinance in question was unconstitutional</a>.</p><blockquote>In an October 19 opinion, U.S. District Court Judge Ricardo Martinez held that Everett's dress code is unconstitutional because it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. ... Martinez rejected the dress code law, saying it violated the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause because it "clearly treats women differently than men by banning a wide variety of women's clothing."</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="3c797" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32004138&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Once again, in the city of Everett, Americans have the right to drive up to coffee shops and have their caffeine fix served to them by scantily clad women. Bikini baristas proved that contrary to the cliche, you CAN fight city hall. And the United States is a better republic because of it.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Progressive governor doesn't understand why locking up criminals is 'so important'

Though what the Fetterman debate lacked in human dignity and shame the left and the media (but I repeat myself) should have for propping him up, it more than made up for in content. In New York, I already know I'm voting for Lee Zeldin and what a wretched, horrible person Kathy Hochul is. I knew Zeldin was going to talk about issues that matter to people and Hochul would talk about abortion and Trump.</p><p>So when I was scrolling Twitter and saw someone quote Kathy Hochul saying she doesn't understand why locking up criminals was so important, I assumed there was no way it was accurate.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">‚Ä¶I trust Ryan, but there is no way this is an actual quote. <a href="https://t.co/L7Pa9k6g6N">https://t.co/L7Pa9k6g6N</a><br />‚Äî Brodigan Prime Plus (@brodigan) <a href="https://twitter.com/brodigan/status/1585053468037091329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>It was. Wow.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Zeldin: She still hasn't talked about locking up anyone committing any crimes<br /><br />Hochul: Anyone who commits a crime under our laws, has consequences ‚Äî ùêà ùêùùê®ùêß'ùê≠ ùê§ùêßùê®ùê∞ ùê∞ùê°ùê≤ ùê≠ùê°ùêöùê≠'ùê¨ ùê¨ùê® ùê¢ùê¶ùê©ùê®ùê´ùê≠ùêöùêßùê≠ ùê≠ùê® ùê≤ùê®ùêÆ<a href="https://t.co/GY9YSPQdpY">pic.twitter.com/GY9YSPQdpY</a><br />‚Äî InteractivePolls (@IAPolls2022) <a href="https://twitter.com/IAPolls2022/status/1585058212054675458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Hochul believes criminals in New York receive "consequences" even with the state's recent pro-criminal reforms, and it shouldn't matter if those criminals are arrested. And then arrested again once they commit a crime again. Which we've seen again and again and again. Though if you are a legal gun owner, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/leaked-memo-shows-nypd" target="_blank">Hochul will throw the book at you no questions asked</a>.<br /></p><p>I will say in Kathy defense, from a political standpoint, there is logic behind her ignoring crime <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kathy-hochul-population-loss" target="_blank">and other issues that matter</a>. She's a New York Democrat. Nine times out of ten, as long as Democrats can use social issues to manipulate enough low-information New York City voters to vote against their self-interests, they can win the state. Hence Hochul's campaign up until now being about nothing other than all abortion, all the time, always.</p><p>Unfortunately for Hochul, voters are more concerned about taking the subway without being murdered. New York is ranked a TOSS UP. Hochul now needs to pretend she is a crime fighter after ignoring the issue. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/kathy-hochul-is-no-crime-fighter-new-york-governor-lee-zeldin-nyc-new-york-post-11666645305" target="_blank">No one believes her</a>.</p><p>Voters on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley? They believe Kathy Hochul doesn't understand why locking up criminals is important.</p><p><p>
