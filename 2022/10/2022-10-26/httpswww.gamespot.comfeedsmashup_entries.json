Suddenly you\u2019re on Rotfront, and meat is taking over. When you arrive, you\u2019ll see a big mural that depicts moon phases. One of them is missing the ring that allows you to adjust it, but don\u2019t worry about that right now: The meat will deliver. Your main goal for the Rotfront area is to find six tarot cards and solve the moon phase puzzles. Here's how to do every step.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Finding the tarot cards</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">As you probably expect by now, the tarot cards are scattered across the area and aren\u2019t entirely accessible right off the bat. Considering the entire purpose of the new area is finding the tarot cards, you\u2019re on your own when it comes to rounding them up. However, here\u2019s a quick overview of where you come across them.</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\">The Lovers card can be found by using acetone on the painting.</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Death can be gained by using Erika Itou\u2019s birthday on the keypad and watching Isa die in the bookstore.</li><li dir=\"ltr\">The moon can be found in the safe, unlocked using pareidolia.</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Sun is obtained by developing the photo and using it in the scanner.</li><li dir=\"ltr\">For the star card, you\u2019ll need to broadcast the sound of magpies to the locked magpie box via your radio.</li><li dir=\"ltr\">The tower is amongst some delicious-looking food in the cafeteria.</li></ul><figure style=\"width: 3840px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1750/17503512/4054734-screen_signalis16.jpg\"><img alt=\"You solved the puzzle!

The diary isn\u2019t actually all that cryptic. It talks about the writer having five dreams, each relating to a planet and pretty clearly suggesting which card corresponds to each. It talks about skyscrapers and lovers pretty clearly.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/signalis-tarot-card-and-moon-phase-puzzle-guide/1100-6508666/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/modern-warfare-2-realism-mode-no-death-pistols-only/2300-6459853/", "title": "Modern Warfare 2: Realism Mode, No Death Pistols Only", "date_published": "2022-10-26 23:15:00+00:00", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1574/15746725/4054727-cod2realismnodeath_site.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> We head to the US/Mexico border in 4k on Realism difficulty, no deaths and only our pistol to hunt down Hassan Zayani and stop a terrorist threat.", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/modern-warfare-2s-multiplayer-launch-details-gamespot-news/2300-6459852/", "title": "Modern Warfare 2\u2019s Multiplayer Launch Details | GameSpot News", "date_published": "2022-10-26 22:48:00+00:00", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1574/15746725/4054716-news1026_v0.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> Today we\u2019re talking about what you can expect from Modern Warfare 2\u2019s multiplayer at launch as well as a new Last of Us multiplayer update", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-on-prime-video-for-november-2022-the-english-my-policeman-and-el-presidente-season-2/1100-6508665/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "New On Prime Video For November 2022: The English, My Policeman, and El Presidente Season 2", "date_published": "2022-10-26 22:11:00+00:00", "description": "<p>With Halloween in the rearview, it's time to move past all horror all the time and move into Christmas movies.

They must face increasingly terrifying obstacles that will test them to their limits, physically and psychologically. But as each obstacle is overcome, it draws them closer to their ultimate destination\u2014the new town of Hoxem, Wyoming. It is here, after an investigation by the local sheriff Robert Marshall (Stephen Rea, The Shadow Line) and young widow Martha Myers (Valerie Pachner, A Hidden Life) into a series of bizarre and macabre unsolved murders, that the full extent of their intertwined history will be truly understood, and they will come face-to-face with the future they must live.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-on-prime-video-for-november-2022-the-english-my-policeman-and-el-presidente-season-2/1100-6508665/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-modern-warfare-2-launch-update-addresses-visibility-audio-and-ui-issues/1100-6508663/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "CoD: Modern Warfare 2 Launch Update Addresses Visibility, Audio, And UI Issues", "date_published": "2022-10-26 20:56:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The launch day for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2's almost here, and Infinity Ward has detailed some of the changes implemented from beta feedback. There are some pretty notable updates coming with the game's October 28 release.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">First, Infinity Ward revealed that beta feedback was used to increase enemy visibility. The developer said this was implemented by adding diamond icons above the heads of enemies to clearly identify opponents in the match. Additionally, tweaks were made to lighting and contrast for improved enemy visibility.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Modern Warfare 2's audio also received a few adjustments before release. The overall range of footstep audio has been updated to allow enemy players to get closer to targets before they are able to detect footsteps. Players can also expect teammate footstep audio to be quieter.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-modern-warfare-2-launch-update-addresses-visibility-audio-and-ui-issues/1100-6508663/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/11-cute-anime-shows-that-are-actually-horrifying/2900-4422/", "title": "11 Cute Anime Shows That Are Actually Horrifying", "date_published": "2022-10-26 20:48:00+00:00", "description": "<p><h2>Don't let the bubbly characters and flowery names fool you, these shows are straight-up devastating.</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4054681-03.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Anime, as a medium, contains multitudes. It can deliver anything from slice-of-life to romance to <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/20-horror-anime-that-will-make-you-wish-youd-never-watched-them/2900-3749/\">straight-up horror</a> and everything in between. But one of its biggest strengths is its ability to take those genres and ideas and mash them together into new and unexpected combinations. We see this all the time, even in the mainstream--sports-focused shows will blend in elements of big Shonen-style fights and power battles, romance stories will pull in supernatural or sci-fi elements, just about everything under the sun can be turned into an Isekai story where a protagonist gets sent into a different world or universe.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But one of the most under-appreciated genre-blends in anime has to be the \"cute-but-horrific\" combo. Broadly speaking, anime is understood to be home to some of the cutest and most cuddly characters around, and with its penchant for stylization and colorful costumes, it's not difficult to see where that reputation came from--and these are stories that use those assumptions to their advantage to deliver maximum shock and awe. We've collected 11 shows that lure you in with adorable characters, bubbly protagonists, and happy-sounding titles and then bring the pain.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Some of these shows may be perfect for Halloween viewing, while others may be best suited for when you're in the right mind to shoulder some major existential dread. They range from serial killers and tragic magical girls to full-on blood-soaked explorations of loneliness and suicide, so consider this your warning moving forward!</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And in the meantime, head over to <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;offerid=913238.1350&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;u1=[subid_value]\">Hulu</a> for all the latest streaming anime, like <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;offerid=913238.1357&amp;type=3&amp;subid=-&amp;u1=[subid_value]\">Chainsaw Man</a> and Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War.

Madoka Magica</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4054678-01.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>The Magical Girl genre had plenty of dark stories prior to the release of Madoka Magica, but Madoka Magica was arguably the first to spin off into its very own subgenre of Magical Girl horror. What looks like a very cute, very standard story about a young girl who gets the power to fight crime in a cute costume with a frilly transformation sequence abruptly pivots into a shocking, brutal, and bleak look at the reality of entropy, and the futility of trying to do good. This one is as nihilistic as they come.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Wonder Egg Priority</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4054680-02.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>With its modern, sleak art style and brightly colored sets, Wonder Egg Priority really lures you in with the idea that it might be a (lowkey surreal) slice-of-life story. Instead, it turns into a deeply sad look at suicide and depression. You might want to tread with caution on this one.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Made in Abyss</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4054677-00.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">It would be difficult to make characters cuter than the protagonists of Made in Abyss. With their circular babyfaces and big bright eyes, everything about this show looks like a kid-friendly adventure series\u2013until, uh. It abruptly stops being so kid-friendly and becomes something else entirely. Let's just say that those big, bright eyes stop looking so cute when there's blood pouring out of them.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. The Promised Neverland</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4054679-04.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Who doesn't love a feel-good orphan story? Unfortunately, that's not really what The Promised Neverland is. On the surface, it looks like a nostalgic story of kids finding themselves and new families. In reality, it's about monsters and cannibalism. You know, the classics.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Higurashi: When They Cry</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4054682-05.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>This one is a couple decades old by now, but still worth mentioning. Higurashi: When They Cry looks like a very typical early '00s anime, complete with the angular hair and features and slightly exaggerated proportions. It's actually a murder mystery, however, that spirals into a story of paranoia and death, dismantling the idea of a quiet, cute, fun life in the countryside.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. School-Live</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4054683-06.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>School-Live knows exactly what it's doing with its intensely cute, pink-haired protagonist and her friend posing with big smiles in their happy, definitely normal high school. That's how it gets you. In reality, the story is about a group of teenagers surviving a zombie apocalypse holed up in their school, which they fantasize about being a cute and safe place to maintain their own sanity. Like you do.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Happy Sugar Life</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4054685-08.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>With a name like Happy Sugar Life, you know you're in for a treat. Focusing on obsessive love and friendship between two young girls, Happy Sugar Life kind of feels like NBC's Hannibal by way of cute little anime characters. There's plenty of murder and deciet and psychological horror all in one convient package.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Shadow Star: Narutaru</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4054684-07.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Do you ever think about how messed up the concept of Pokemon would be in any other context? Taking wild animals and forcing them to fight one another (and sometimes forcing them to attack other people?) It's all pretty bleak when you think about it. And that's exactly what Shadow Star, AKA Narutaru wants you to do.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Magical Girl Raising Project</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4054686-09.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>In the same vein as Madoka Magica, Magical Girl Raising Project takes the concept of the magical girl and spins it on its head--this time, with a slightly more modern twist. The story focuses on a popular mobile game which gives its players a 1-in-10000 chance of becoming a real-life magical girl. Unfortunately, none of them seem to really think that wish through until it's too late.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. Elfen Lied</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4054687-10.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Another oldie-but-goodie, Elfen Lied actually became pretty famous in the early '00s for the way it used its cutesy-looking characters to dive into some pretty heavy-hitting themes--most of which frequently ended in blood baths, nudity, or a combination of both. This one definitely isn't for kids.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. Mirai Nikki</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1582/15828986/4054693-11.png\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>This one doesn't necessarily masquerade as cute for too long, but we're still going to include it because it doesn't broadcast how dark it is right off the bat, either. Based around the idea of literal gods granting the power to see the future to teenagers, and the subsequent drama (and violence) that eventually begets, Mirai Nikki starts bleak and only gets bleaker.</p></h3></p><br />", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-horror-game-deals-for-halloween-on-ps5-xbox-pc-and-switch/2900-4420/", "title": "Best Horror Game Deals For Halloween On PS5, Xbox, PC, And Switch", "date_published": "2022-10-26 19:00:00+00:00", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4054441-deadbydaylight.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Halloween is just around the corner, and the best way to celebrate the spooky season is by plopping down with a chilling horror game.

There's going to be a handful of new holiday programming in there to get you ready for winter as well as plenty of other content including The Crown Season 5 and a new comedy about a familiar video store.</p><p>Early in the month, Netflix will premiere its comedy series about the last Blockbuster store in America, simply titled Blockbuster. The series stars Randall Park and Melissa Fumero as they play Blockbuster employees trying to keep their video store open and staff happy amid competition and complicated feelings. Blockbuster Season 1 hits Netflix on November 3.</p><div>          </div><p>One of the most anticipated series finally debuts with Tim Burton's <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-crazy-and-kooky-look-at-the-addams-family-for-tim-burtons-wednesday-tv-series/1100-6506538/\">Wednesday</a> coming to Netflix November 23. This coming-of-age supernatural mystery comedy focuses on Wednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega) and her years as a high school student at Nevermore Academy.

The game features 33 Platforms and a total of 51 weapons to unlock, most of which have attachments to unlock as well.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">With this new weapon Platform system, each Platform has a unique progression tree, which details every unlock within that platform. For example, once a specific barrel is unlocked for one gun, it's then made available to all weapons in that same shared Platform. Some attachments will be Platform specific, while other attachments will be universally shared with other compatible weapons. This sounds more complicated than it needs to be, but basically, this allows players to unlock attachments faster, since they don't have to unlock the same attachment over and over for different guns.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-modern-warfare-2-heres-everything-you-can-unlock-before-season-1/1100-6508660/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-says-price-hikes-are-coming-but-not-until-after-the-holidays/1100-6508657/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Xbox Boss Phil Spencer Says Price Hikes Are Coming, But Not Until After The Holidays", "date_published": "2022-10-26 18:14:00+00:00", "description": "<p>Speaking today at a Wall Street Journal event in southern California, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said he believes prices for certain Xbox products or services will go up, but not until after the holidays.</p><p>\"I do think at some point we'll have to raise the prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was important to maintain the prices,\" Spencer told the audience, as relayed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1585333470083284992\">Tom Warren of The Verge</a>.</p><p>Spencer was apparently speaking generally about price increases at Xbox and not about any one specific product or service.

Players have been sharing their new UI layouts on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/ydzz2z/proud_of_your_ui_post_a_screenshot_and_share_an/\">social media</a>, and while the response to the changes have been largely positive, there are a few standout complaints.</p><div>          </div><p dir=\"ltr\">For starters, there are a few pieces of the UI that can't be moved. The vast majority of the UI can be scaled up or down and moved around the screen, but that's not the case for the XP bar, which is still locked in place. While the mini-map can be moved around, it can't be scaled up or down, much to the frustration of players. There have also been reports of a bug that is causing UI layouts to not save correctly, forcing some players who have spent hours customizing their UI to have to do it all over again.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-players-have-a-few-notes-on-the-games-ui-overhaul/1100-6508658/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/tales-of-the-jedi-13-things-we-learned-about-the-star-wars-universe/2900-4421/", "title": "Tales Of The Jedi: 13 Things We Learned About The Star Wars Universe", "date_published": "2022-10-26 17:50:00+00:00", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4054503-untitled-1.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The Star Wars prequels aren't the best films to come out of the Star Wars franchise, but they did introduce fans to a cavalcade of new ideas and characters. Out of the prequels we got the Clones Wars animated series, which led to Rebels, which leads to the new Disney+ series Tales of the Jedi.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">All six episodes of the new animated series released at once, giving fans a better look at two characters that went on very different paths: Dooku and Ahsoka Tano. Three episodes were dedicated to each character, with each episode following a specific, pivotal moment from each of their lives. Each episode is around 20-minutes long, so you can burn through the show easily in a couple of hours.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"[Various] - Sign up for Disney+\">    <div class=\"buylink__container\">                                                                                                                                                                                               <div class=\"buylink__item\">                  <div class=\"buylink__image-container clickable\">                                            <img alt=\"\" class=\"buylink__image\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1591/15918215/3807474-disneyplus.jpg\" />                                 <a href=\"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/159047/564546/9358?&amp;sharedId=gamespot&amp;u=https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/subscribe-now&amp;subId1=subid_value\"></a>                              </div>                   <div class=\"buylink__text\">                      <p class=\"buylink__title text-bold\">                        <a href=\"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/159047/564546/9358?&amp;sharedId=gamespot&amp;u=https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/subscribe-now&amp;subId1=subid_value\">Sign up for Disney+</a>           </p>                                                       <p class=\"buylink__deck\">                          <a href=\"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/159047/564546/9358?&amp;sharedId=gamespot&amp;u=https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/subscribe-now&amp;subId1=subid_value\">Get access to Marvel, Star Wars, and more for $8/month.</a>             </p>                                              </div>                  <div class=\"buylink__links\">                                                                                                                                                          <a href=\"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/159047/564546/9358?&amp;sharedId=gamespot&amp;u=https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/subscribe-now&amp;subId1=subid_value\">See Disney+ plans</a>                     </div>                         </div>                     </div> </div></div><p dir=\"ltr\">Going through the show, we learned a lot about both Ahsoka and Dooku, as the series follows their journeys chronologically in the greater Star Wars universe--and it's bookended with Ahsoka tales. But the show isn't just about them. It answers questions that we didn't even know we had, up until now. Because of this, we found 13 moments throughout Tales of the Jedi that gave us greater insight into the Star Wars Universe.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Obviously, you're going to find some spoilers for the show below.</strong></p><p>For more on the world of Star Wars, check out <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-star-wars-movie-and-tv-show-ranked-by-metacritic/2900-4026/\">every Star Wars movie and TV show ranked by Metacritic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-20-most-pivotal-moments-in-star-wars-movie-history/2900-4093/\">20 pivotal moments in Star Wars movie history</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/every-upcoming-star-wars-game/1100-6499936/\">every upcoming Star Wars game</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. The lines on Ahsoka's face</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4054504-1.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Episode 1: \"Life and Death\"</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Ahsoka we know today and baby Ahsoka have a few differences, obviously. However, one major difference is the white pigments on her face as a baby--ignore that blue line on her forehead, that was put there. When Ahsoka was born, she had four white dots: one on each cheek and two on the forehead.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Her first encounter with the Force</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4054505-2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Episode 1: \"Life and Death\"</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">We know bits and pieces about Ahsoka's life, but what we didn't know was that she was kidnapped by a saber tooth tiger while hunting with her mother as an infant. It seems as though any other baby would have been lunch for the beast, but not Ahsoka, who used her Force powers to connect with the tiger, right before she would have been eaten. She returned to town afterward, riding on top of it.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Dooku isn't that complicated</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4054506-3.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Episode 2: \"Justice\"</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the prequel trilogy, there's an understanding that Dooku was a Jedi and became a Sith. He wasn't flatout evil like other Sith, though. In Tales of the Jedi, we get a much better understanding of the character. He serves the people of the Republic, not the Republic itself. He wants to stand up for those who can't stand up for themselves. However, what separates Dooku from other Jedi is that violence can be seen as a necessary action when defending those who need it.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. That's Qui-Gon Jinn</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4054507-4.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Episode 2: \"Justice\"</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Some may have forgotten, but Qui-Gon Jinn's mentor was Dooku. Throughout the episode, Dooku's mentee is never named, up until the end when Dooku says his name. Why does every Jedi in training have the Luke Skywalker haircut?</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. The Republic is a mess</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4054508-5.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Episode 3: \"Choices\"</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The prequel movies showed the Republic as a functioning body of government, and the Clone Wars animated series showed cracks in the demeanor--the Republic came off like a functioning Mr. Bean rather than a working government. However, throughout Episode 2 and 3 of Tales of the Jedi, we see another side of the Republic. It's a mess. It's corrupt. There are some bad people in seats of power. Then he sees the Jedi supporting this madness time and time again. There's a reason he left the Jedi.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. A familiar voice</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4054509-6.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Episode 4: \"The Sith Lord\"</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">When Qui-Gon Jinn first appeared in Episode 2 of this series, he had a different voice actor. Now, in Episode 4, none other than Liam Neeson has returned to reprise his role from The Phantom Menace.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Yaddle is back</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4054510-7.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Episode 4: \"The Sith Lord\"</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The alien species known as \"Whatever Yoda is,\" Yaddle is the second known alien after Yoda's introduction--and long before Grogu's in Mandalorian. Making her first appearance in The Phantom Menace, Yaddle didn't get a lot of screentime. However, being the only other member of this species, she's long been suspected to be the mother of Grogu AKA The Child. It's also important to note that Yaddle speaks normally, not in that weird backwards speak, which is Yoda's signature style.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Yaddle is very important to Dooku's story</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4054511-8.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Episode 4: \"The Sith Lord\"</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Voiced by Bryce Dallas Howard, Yaddle isn't just tossed in here to tell people, \"See! That could be Baby Yoda's mom!\" Yaddle is central to Dooku's pivot to the Dark Side. While serving the Jedi, Dooku was working with Darth Sidious. And while he was helping Sidious with his plans, Dooku still wants what's best for the Republic.</p><p>While meeting with Sidious, he's confronted by Yaddle, who overhears everything. Dooku knows he's wronged the Jedi--who are trying to do their best, even though they're constantly wrapped up in bureaucratic nonsense. However, this confrontation from Yaddle--along with her asking Dooku to turn himself in--pushes Dooku completely to the Dark Side. He knows he can never go back to the Jedi now, even though Yaddle says she agrees with him in so many ways.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Yaddle's end</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4054512-9.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Episode 4: \"The Sith Lord\"</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Since Yaddle's story was never really explored, outside of her only appearance in Phantom Menace, but there's always been speculation about what happened to her--especially after Grogu was revealed in the Mandalorian. It was suspected that she fled with her child during Order 66. That's not the case though.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">After confronting Dooku and Sidious, she was killed by a lightsaber strike. The events of this episode take place after Phantom Menace but before Attack of the Clones, so this raises more questions about Grogu, since his age in Mandalorian might not line up with when he was born.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Is Yaddle his mother? Is Grogu actually a Kamino clone?</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. Why these training droids exist</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4054513-10.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Episode 5: \"Practice Makes Perfect\"</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Since A New Hope hit theaters, we've seen these Jedi training droids that fly around and shoot blasters. But why though? Why do these things exist? In Episode 5, we see Ahsoka training with them, and we learn why they exist. In the training room, Obi-Wan tells Anakin, \"These are the new training remotes, designed to simulate battle droids.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Jedi know the war will continue with droids in the future, so the next generation of Jedi is training accordingly.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. Ahsoka after Order 66 but before Rebels</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4054514-11.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Episode 6: \"Resolve\"</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">We know what Ahsoka is up to in the years before A New Hope, as she was featured quite a bit on the animated series Rebels. However, before Rebels and post-Order 66, that's all a little bit of a mystery. We know she escaped the clone army during the rise of the Empire thanks to Captain Rex, whose inhibitor chip was destroyed thanks to Ashoka. But what happened to her in between? Well, she continued to be in hiding and worked as a farmer, under the name Ash-La--probably named after the woman who voices Ahsoka, Ashley Eckstein.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>12. This \"Sith\"</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4054515-12.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Episode 6: \"Resolve\"</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">We meet a Force-sensitive villain under the employ of the Empire, with the logo emblazoned on his cloak. This is also the start of the Empire employing Force-sensitive baddies and calling them Inquisitors, a term we're all wildly-familiar with now.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The show credits list this character simply as Inquisitor, and it's voiced by none other than Clancy Brown (The Shawshank Redemption, Dexter: New Blood). In the novel Ahsoka, by E. K. Johnston, this is Sixth Brother--as this sequence of events is in the book. However, this Inquisitor doesn't look like the Sixth Brother much--as he's appeared in some Marvel Comics series--and the two die in different ways. It's probably just a new character for this one moment.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>13. Why Ahsoka comes out of hiding</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/4054516-13.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Episode 6: \"Resolve\"</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">While Ahsoka doesn't flat-out say it, seeing the farm and village she worked in burned down by the Empire was her call to action. If she stays, there will be more Inquisitors searching for her and anyone she stays with. The only way to truly get freedom is to fight back.</p></h3></p><br />", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/seth-rogens-sausage-party-getting-a-tv-show-with-original-voice-cast/1100-6508654/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Seth Rogen's Sausage Party Getting A TV Show With Original Voice Cast", "date_published": "2022-10-26 17:49:00+00:00", "description": "<p>The Sausage Party universe is expanding.

Mostly, though, new games have adapted the fundamentals of physical CCGs. With Marvel Snap, Hearthstone veteran studio Second Dinner has reduced the collectible card game to its most essential pieces and reimagined them, creating a combination of systems that are elegantly simple without ever feeling simplistic.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Like many other modern card games, Marvel Snap automates its equivalent of mana or energy, adding one unit per turn. But then it streamlines the genre even further: Each game lasts only six turns, and there is no direct combat between characters or choosing whether to deal damage to enemy scrubs or \"go face\" for direct player damage. Instead, your goal is to accumulate the most power across three locations. At the end of six turns, whoever controls two of the three locations wins the match, and ties are determined by total power across all three.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Those three locations are randomly selected from a massive pool, each introducing their own intricacies and elements, and the areas range from the straightforward to the silly. The symbiote planet Klyntar will depower every card played on it, while NYC's Central Park adds a 1-power squirrel to each other location. The locations are revealed from left to right over the first three turns.

The game's look, sound, and feel is true-to-form, right down to the voices of Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson as Ray Stantz and Winston Zeddemore, respectively. Manning a proton pack and PKE meter for the first time in order to track and trap ghosts is a shot of ectoplasmic adrenaline. As a video game, however, it falls into a devious trap of its own, one where excitement hastily shifts to monotonous repetition. Spirits Unleashed captures the Ghostbusters feeling well, but that authenticity belies a shallow, repetitive game that quickly wears out its welcome.</p><div>          </div><p dir=\"ltr\">Spirits Unleashed puts you in the shoes of a new Ghostbusters recruit, a nameless grunt sent in to deal with the paranormal hauntings in New York City. The repurposed firehouse from the Ghostbusters franchise serves as your base of operations, and it features a workbench for upgrading gear, lockers to customize your Ghostbuster, and a training area to work out the kinks. Across the alley from the firehouse is an oddities shop run by Ray Stantz himself, where you can talk to the Dan Aykroyd-voiced character about the current goings-on.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The core gameplay loop is an asymmetrical multiplayer experience, where four Ghostbusters take on a single ghost; the Busters must trap the ghost with no chance of escape, while the Ghost must evade capture and scare NPCs through noise and possession in order to fill a \"haunt meter.\" The ghost has three rifts that act as respawn points at its disposal, and when all three are destroyed, the ghost's next trip into a trap will mark victory for the Busters.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghostbusters-spirits-unleashed-review-into-the-ether/1900-6417990/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "favourite": false}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/joker-2-not-in-new-dc-universe-batman-2-still-years-away/1100-6508652/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "title": "Joker 2 Not In New DC Universe, Batman 2 Still Years Away", "date_published": "2022-10-26 17:17:00+00:00", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">It sounds like Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux won't be a part of any connected DC film universe the newly instated James Gunn might oversee.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday, October 25, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gunn-will-co-lead-dc-studios-steering-upcoming-dceu-movies-shows-and-cartoons/1100-6508620/\">it was announced that Gunn would co-lead DC Studios</a> alongside Peter Safran, which will include things like DCEU movies, shows, and cartoons.

The Callisto Protocol stands out in what it does differently, in which it injects a compelling melee combat system into a survival-horror game. Many survival-horror games keep the monsters more than an arm's length away, allowing you to keep them at bay with a handgun, plasma cutter, camera, or some other manner of clicking-and-shooting.
