Firstly, the company operates offices and factories outside of the US. Today\u2019s announcement doesn\u2019t cover those facilities. Secondly, even when you factor in all of GM\u2019s buildings, they\u2019re only a small part of the company\u2019s total carbon footprint.</p><p>According to its <a href=\"https://www.gmsustainability.com/priorities/reducing-carbon-emissions/journey-to-zero-emissions.html\"><ins>most recent sustainability report</ins></a>, Scope 1 and 2 emissions account for only two percent of GM\u2019s total emissions.

The Scope 1 category includes all pollution produced directly by an organization. Scope 2, meanwhile, encompasses indirect emissions created from the electricity, heating and cooling it buys. The majority of GM\u2019s emissions, a whopping 98 percent, aren\u2019t produced by its facilities. Instead, they come from the company\u2019s supply chain and the consumers using its cars.</p><p>To be fair, GM is working on reducing those emissions.

You might have a reason to give it another look, though. Apple has <a href=\"https://beta.icloud.com/\">introduced</a> a beta iCloud web client that presents far more info at a glance, with a customizable tile layout that reflects your priorities. It's easier to switch between apps thanks to launchers on the home page and menu bar, and you can quickly start tasks (such as writing email or adding calendar events) thanks to another menu option.</p><p>The revamp also improves access to iCloud+ features like custom email domains and Hide My Email. And if you're panicking at the thought of lost info, a \"Data Recovery\" tool will help you reclaim bookmarks, calendars, contacts and iCloud Drive files deleted within the last 30 days.

The beta may encourage you to stick to the Apple ecosystem, though.

That allows it to accurately track someone who might be moving and turning away from the camera, and keep tracking them even if they disappear from view for a moment. On top of that, it can now pick out different subjects like cars, trains, plains, animals and insects.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Though the A7R V is primarily targeted at photographers, it's much better at video than ever, too. Where the A7R IV was limited to 8-bit 4K at 30fps with either cropping or line-skipping, the A7R V now shoots 8K video at up to 24 fps, along with 6.2K without line-skipping or pixel binning. With the same heatsink as the A7S III, it allows for unlimited 4K recording and up to 30 minutes of 8K capture.</p><div id=\"e47cb2f9d43040e59381d083bc176517\"></div><p>It can also handle supersampled 10-bit 4K video using the entire sensor width at up to 30 fps, or at 60fps with a 1.2x crop.

And in lieu of the tilting display used in the A7R IV, the new model has a fully articulating screen that makes it more useful for high-angle shooting, video and more.&nbsp;</p><p>The A7R V shoots at the same 10fps speeds as before, which is impressive for such a high-resolution camera.

Its mechanics, environments and monsters are deeply familiar, unapologetically feeding off the immersive sci-fi horror concepts of <em>Dead Space</em>. While playing a preview of <em>The Callisto Protocol</em> on PlayStation 5, I was reminded of <a href=\"https://clip.cafe/waynes-world-1992/were-looking-down-on-waynes-basement/\">that scene from<em> Wayne\u2019s World</em></a> where the boys are looking down on a film set that looks like Wayne\u2019s basement, but it\u2019s not actually Wayne\u2019s basement, and Garth says, \"Isn\u2019t that weird?\" They all agree it is.</p><p>Playing <em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, I found myself trapped in a world between old and new. Like I said, it was strange. However, once the weirdness wore off, playing <em>The Callisto Protocol</em> just felt good.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p><em>Callisto </em>is the first game out of Striking Distance Studios, a team led by <em>Dead Space</em> co-creator Greg Schofield \u2014 so yeah, all the references are coming straight from the source. And there are plenty of similarities to go around: <em>Callisto</em> stars a lone space dude fighting through rooms of mutated humans; headshots are less effective than shooting extremities and tentacles; there\u2019s no UI and the protagonist\u2019s health is displayed on the back of his neck; stomping enemies is the best way to ensure they\u2019re dead; there\u2019s a gravity gun that functions like a kinesis ability; and the death screens are particularly gruesome. One early level even has a vignette with the phrase, \"shoot the tentacles\" scrawled across the wall in blood, riffing on the classic <em>Dead Space</em> blood tag that read, \"cut off their limbs.\"</p><figure><img alt=\"The Callisto Protocol\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/0b7c97b0-548d-11ed-acfb-c779d8205ff5\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Striking Distance Studios</div></figure><p>I had the luxury of playing the <em>Callisto Protocol</em> preview just a week after trying out Motive Studio\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/dead-space-preview-video-first-look-150005023.html\"><em>Dead Space</em> remake</a>, so the similarities stung sharply \u2014 but so did the differences. <em>The Callisto Protocol</em> does some things that <em>Dead Space </em>couldn\u2019t, and it\u2019s clearly a bigger game in a more complex world. Where the USG Ishimura in <em>Dead Space</em> often felt claustrophobic, the dead-moon prison colony in <em>The Callisto Protocol </em>feels vast and mazelike, with ladders, vents, long hallways, tight corridors and open laboratories with multiple access points for enemies, all of it overgrown with alien life.</p><p>The early game features a variety of enemy types \u2014 rushing monsters, tall spitters, leather-daddy tanks and invisible beasts with too many legs, to name a few \u2014 and they\u2019re each difficult to kill in their own special ways. The twist is that all of the infected humans, or Biophage, will mutate in front of the player\u2019s eyes when they\u2019re not killed quickly enough, growing stronger in their evolved form. Enemy spawn points are not randomized, a fact that I discovered after dying a few times in a row in a single room. (The death screens are numerous and reach Mortal Kombat levels of brutality in the best possible way.)</p><p>All of these details result in a rich sense of strategy, with explodables, ammo drops and escape routes secreted around each combat area. <em>Callisto</em> is a video game for video game people, offering little actual direction while relying on the environment to communicate escape and attack opportunities \u2014 a suspiciously red canister in the middle of a long walkway, a ladder rung dangling just within reach, a box barely big enough to duck behind. Each detail blends smoothly into the futuristic surroundings, only standing out when a horde of Biophage are breathing down your neck.</p><section><img alt=\"The Callisto Protocol\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/0b751da1-548d-11ed-b387-af90d09d3e48\" /></section><p><em>The</em><em>Callisto Protocol</em> is a fully formed concept executed with proficiency. The Striking Distance crew clearly know how to make a game feel tense and horrific and satisfying, and with <em>Callisto</em>, they\u2019re just showing off. Only one segment of my playthrough sticks out negatively in my mind: The protagonist essentially finds himself on a water slide, and players have to navigate the concrete pillars and other obstacles in his path. It isn\u2019t a terrible concept, but personally, I don\u2019t need any more on-rails sequences in my games. Overall though, the preview was a haze of sci-fi gore, action and surprise, and I\u2019m excited to play the full game when it comes out on December 2nd.</p><p>To be honest, I almost expected more out of <em>The Callisto Protocol</em> \u2014 more growth since <em>Dead Space</em>, a new perspective on horror, a stronger attempt to be different than that iconic game. Instead, <em>Callisto </em>leans into <em>Dead Space</em>\u2019s original ideas and competes with them directly, even down to the release timing \u2014 the <em>Dead Space</em> remake is due out just eight weeks after <em>Callisto</em>. Something about that feels personal, like <em>The Callisto Protocol</em> is shoving something in <em>Dead Space</em>\u2019s face; as if, more than a decade later, Schofield is trying to prove something to EA. That\u2019s not based on any conversations with developers, it\u2019s just a gut feeling I have.</p><figure><img alt=\"The Callisto Protocol\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/0b751da0-548d-11ed-b1be-18269aa7193a\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Striking Distance Studios</div></figure><p>Conspiracy theories aside, it\u2019s fortunate that <em>Dead Space</em> provides such a timeless foundation for <em>The Callisto Protocol</em>\u2019s playground.

That\u2019s on top of big improvements in things like color accuracy, size and resolution.</p><p>The choice is nice but overwhelming, as there are a lot of products in this market and a lot of features. Buyers now have to consider things like HDR, brightness, color accuracy, type of display technology, input lag and more. And then there are the usual considerations like size, adjustability, inputs and so on.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>To help you with all that, we\u2019ve researched the latest models for all kinds of markets, whether you\u2019re a gamer, business user or content creator. Read on to find out which model is the best for you and, especially, your budget.</p><h2>The basics</h2><h3>Panel type</h3><p>The cheapest monitors are still TN (twisted nematic), which are strictly for gaming or office use. VA (vertical alignment) monitors are also relatively cheap, while offering good brightness and high contrast ratios. However, content creators will probably want an IPS (in-plane switching) LCD display that delivers better color accuracy, image quality and viewing angles.</p><p>If maximum brightness is important, a quantum dot LCD display is the way to go \u2014 those are typically found in larger displays. OLED monitors are now available and offer the best blacks and color reproduction, but they lack the brightness of LED or quantum dot displays. Plus, they cost a lot. The latest type of OLED monitor, called QD-OLED from Samsung, just came out this year. The most notable advantage is that it can get a lot brighter, with monitors shown at CES 2022 hitting up to 1,000 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>MiniLEDs are now widely used in high-end displays. They\u2019re similar to quantum dot tech, but as the name suggests, it uses smaller LED diodes that are just 0.2mm in diameter. As such, manufacturers can pack in up to three times more LEDs with more local dimming zones, delivering deeper blacks and better contrast.</p><h3>Screen size, resolution and display format</h3><p>In this day and age, screen size rules. Where 24-inch displays used to be more or less standard (and can still be useful for basic computing), 27-, 32-, 34- and even 42-inch displays have become popular for entertainment, content creation and even gaming these days.</p><p>Nearly every monitor used to be 16:9, but it\u2019s now possible to find 16:10 and other more exotic display shapes. On the gaming and entertainment side, we\u2019re also seeing very wide and curved monitors with aspect ratios like 21:9. If you do decide to buy an ultrawide display, however, keep in mind that a 30-inch 21:9 model is the same height as a 24-inch monitor, so you might end up with a smaller display than you expected. As a rule of thumb, add 25 percent to the size of a 21:9 monitor to get the vertical height you\u2019d expect from a 16:9 model.</p><p>4K is nearly a must for content creators, and some folks are even going for 5K or all the way up to 8K. Keep in mind, though, that you\u2019ll need a pretty powerful computer to drive all those pixels. And 4K should be paired with a screen size of 27 inches and up, or you won\u2019t notice much difference between 1440p. At the same time, I wouldn\u2019t get a model larger than 27 inches unless it\u2019s 4K, as you\u2019ll start to see pixelation if you\u2019re working up close to the display.</p><p>One new category to consider is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-27-asus-240hz-portable-monitor-for-gamers-hands-on.html\">portable monitors</a> designed to be carried and used with laptops. Those typically come in 1080p resolutions and sizes from 13-15 inches. They usually have a lightweight kickstand-type support that folds up to keep things compact.</p><figure><img alt=\"Samsung Smart Monitor M5\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-07/e19ecb10-fd3f-11ec-a77d-fca8b8a4ea1f\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Samsung</div></figure><h3>HDR</h3><p>HDR is the buzzy monitor feature to have these days, as it adds vibrancy to entertainment and gaming \u2013 but be careful before jumping in. Some monitors that claim HDR on the marketing materials don\u2019t even conform to a base standard. To be sure that a display at least meets minimum HDR specs, you\u2019ll want to choose one with a DisplayHDR rating with each tier representing maximum brightness in nits.</p><p>However, the lowest DisplayHDR 400 and 500 tiers may disappoint you with a lack of brightness, washed out blacks and mediocre color reproduction. If you can afford it, choose a model with DisplayHDR 600, 1000 or True Black 400, True Black 500 and True Black 600. The True Black settings are designed primarily for OLED models, with maximum black levels at .0005 nits.</p><p>Where televisions typically offer HDR10 and Dolby Vision or HDR10+, most PC monitors only support the HDR10 standard, other than a few (very expensive) models. That doesn\u2019t matter much for content creation or gaming, but HDR streaming on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and other services won\u2019t look quite as punchy. In addition, most models supporting HDR600 (and up) are gaming, rather than content creation monitors \u2013 with a few exceptions.&nbsp;</p><h3>Refresh rate</h3><p>Refresh rate is a key feature, particularly on gaming monitors. A bare minimum nowadays is 60Hz, and 80Hz refresh rates and up are much easier on the eyes. However, most 4K displays top out at 60Hz with some rare exceptions and the HDMI 2.0 spec only supports 4K at 60Hz, so you\u2019d need at least DisplayPort 1.4 (4K at 120Hz) or HDMI 2.1. The latter is now available on a number of monitors, particularly gaming displays. However, it\u2019s only supported on the latest NVIDIA RTX 3000- and 4000-series, AMD RX 6000-series GPUs.</p><h3>Inputs</h3><p>There are essentially three types of modern display inputs: Thunderbolt, DisplayPort and HDMI. Most monitors built for PCs come with the latter two, while a select few (typically built for Macs) will use Thunderbolt. To add to the confusion, USB-C ports may be Thunderbolt 3 and by extension, DisplayPort compatible, so you may need a USB-C to Thunderbolt or DisplayPort cable adapter depending on your display.</p><h3>Color bit depth</h3><p>Serious content content creators should consider a more costly 10-bit monitor that can display billions of colors. If budget is an issue, you can go for an 8-bit panel that can fake billions of colors via dithering (often spec\u2019d as \u201c8-bit + FRC\u201d). For entertainment or business purposes, a regular 8-bit monitor that can display millions of colors will be fine.</p><h3>Color gamut</h3><p>The other aspect of color is the gamut. That expresses the range of colors that can be reproduced and not just the number of colors. Most good monitors these days can cover the sRGB and Rec.709 gamuts (designed for photos and video respectively). For more demanding work, though, you\u2019ll want one that can reproduce more demanding modern gamuts like AdobeRGB, DCI-P3 and Rec.2020 gamuts, which encompass a wider range of colors. The latter two are often used for film projection and HDR, respectively.</p><h3>Console gaming</h3><p>Both the Xbox Series X and Sony\u2019s PS5 can handle 4K 120Hz HDR gaming, so if you\u2019re into resolution over pure speed, you\u2019ll want a monitor that can keep up. 4K resolution, HDR and at least 120Hz is the minimum starting point, but fortunately there are 27-inch displays with those specs starting at well under $1,000.</p><h3>Pricing and parts shortages</h3><p>Though the pandemic has eased, monitor supply is still a bit tighter than pre-pandemic levels due to supply and demand issues. To that end, you may have trouble finding monitors at Amazon, B&amp;H or elsewhere for the suggested retail price. For our guide below, we\u2019re basing our picks on the MSRP, as long as the street price doesn\u2019t exceed that by more than $25.</p><h2>Engadget picks</h2><h2>Best monitors under $200</h2><h3>Samsung T35F</h3><figure><img alt=\"Samsung T35F\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/4fceb640-5164-11ed-9efd-0a91be373d39\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Samsung</div></figure><p>The monitor with the best balance of size, refresh rate and color accuracy is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FF3JQ28/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=buyersguide2022-20&amp;language=en_US\">Samsung\u2019s $160 27-inch 1080p T35F</a>.

Now, SpaceX has launched a new variant of Starlink for RVs called \"Flat High Performance\" that you can use on moving vehicles. You just have to be willing to pay almost five times as much for the dish needed to be able to access the service.&nbsp;</p><p>The Flat High Performance Starlink for RVs was designed for in-motion use, with a bigger rectangular terminal that can see 35 percent more sky than its standard counterpart. It also has enhanced GPS capabilities, giving the dish the power to connect to more satellites, which enables connection to the Starlink internet even while a vehicle is on the move. The terminal features improved weather resistance and better performance in both hot weather and snow, as well. Unlike the standard version that can be placed on the ground, though, the Flat High Performance dish must be permanently installed on top of your RV.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>SpaceX is already taking pre-orders for Flat High Performance in select markets and will start deliveries in December. Take note that its hardware kit, which includes its dish and mount, will set you back $2,500. The standard Starlink for RVs only requires an upfront payment of $599 for its kit. The service itself costs $135 a month just like the standard version, which is $25 more than a regular Starlink connection.

The XCM-50 is a condenser microphone that appears to be built on the same platform as the <a href=\"https://rode.com/en/microphones/usb/nt-usb-mini\"><ins>NT-USB Mini</ins></a> and features a distinct red button on the front.</p><figure><img alt=\"Two new Rode microphones pictured next to the Rode NT-USB Mini\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/3c18b840-5460-11ed-bcfe-13546124d246\" style=\"height: 1318; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Both microphones are USB only (no XLR), which means you won\u2019t need an audio interface to use them, and they have built-in headphone ports for latency-free monitoring. Which of the two might interest you most will depend on both your preferences and the room where you stream from.</p><p>The XCM-50 has a bright sound that will work well for those in acoustically treated, or \u201csofter\u201d rooms. When tested side by side with its NT-USB Mini doppelganger, they do sound incredibly close, but to my ears the XCM-50 is a tiny bit brighter sounding. The NT-USB Mini sounds a shade \u201ccloser\u201d by comparison.</p><p>The XDM-100 has a more classic \u201cdynamic\u201d microphone sound. While perhaps not quite as well rounded as something like the Shure SM7B or even Rode\u2019s own Podmic, it feels cleaner than the Podcaster that it shares its physical appearance with. If you want a good USB dynamic option, this feels like a competitive choice for the price. Especially once coupled with the new Unify software.</p><p>The one thing that a lot of gamers and streamers really need isn\u2019t so much a microphone \u2013 there are many options for that \u2013 it\u2019s a reliable tool to route all the sounds in your stream, usually some mix of game sounds, chat, music and effects. With Unify, you have a simple software solution that is similar to the routing matrices you find with the GoXLR, the <a href=\"https://www.beacn.com/pages/beacn-mix-create\"><ins>BEACN Mix Create</ins></a> or Elgato\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elgato-wave-3-microphone-hands-on-150021908.html\"><ins>Wave Link</ins></a>.</p><figure><img alt=\"Rode X unify software.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-10/67061980-5460-11ed-bfe3-74a4e3d1898c\" style=\"height: 1334; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Rode</div></figure><p>Unify creates a couple of virtual audio interfaces on your PC and you can then control which app uses what, and where that sound goes. For example, you probably want your intro music to go out on the stream, but maybe you don\u2019t want it in your headphones? Or maybe you want your audience to hear a YouTube video you\u2019re playing, but not the music you\u2019re streaming. With Unify, you can pipe most things to most places, and then change the levels, or \u201cmix\u201d for each destination also.</p><p>Rode has added the ability to record all your audio directly within the app, too. This makes it appealing to more than just streamers. For example, you could use it to record both sides of a Zoom call and be able to feed audio into that call that would otherwise be tricky. The fact that Unify has sound pads for intros and effects means it also works quite well as a software \u201cRodecaster Pro.\u201d</p><p>Unify looks most similar to Wave Link but offers much more fine-grained control. The app isn\u2019t quite as simple as BEACN\u2019s, which lets you access each mix matrix at all times and has a slightly clearer UI. BEACN also benefits from the hardware mixer, too, but there\u2019s no option to record within that app or trigger sound effects.</p><p>Where Unify differs from most of its rivals is that you don\u2019t <em>have</em> to buy the company\u2019s hardware to use it. If you just wanted the software features you can pay $5 a month or $45 a year for the app alone. This means you can easily use it with any microphone you have, you\u2019re not beholden to using a Rode (unlike, Wave Link that requires an Elgato mic). If you <em>do</em> buy a Rode X mic, then the software is free. Sadly, if you already own a Rode USB mic, it won\u2019t unlock the software, you'll be paying like everybody else.</p>", "favourite": false}]
