## Launch HN: Idemeum (YC S21) – Passwordless access to apps and infrastructure

<p>Nik and Jagjit here, founders of Idemeum (<a href="https://www.idemeum.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.idemeum.com/</a>). We are excited to share our product with HN!<p>Idemeum is a SaaS platform that offers a single place to manage access to applications and infrastructure. We let businesses eliminate passwords for everything employees access: devices, applications, servers, and networks. Our cloud platform eliminates VPNs and allows access to applications and infrastructure from anywhere with a single click.<p>In industry terms, we combine Privileged Access Management (PAM), Identity and Access Management (IAM), and passwordless technologies.<p>In simpler terms: you install our mobile application, navigate to your SaaS idemeum tenant, scan a QR-code, and login with biometrics. Once you are in, you can access anything with a single click - SAML Single Sign-On apps, hosted on-premises apps, password apps, SSH servers, and more. There’s a quick overview here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3StOlDjMrQ" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3StOlDjMrQ</a><p>We spent more than a decade in identity access management and threat detection at VMware, Facebook, and Cisco, building platforms to manage user access. That experience left us excited about two things: (1) kill passwords; (2) make things simple.<p>We started our company with the mission to eliminate passwords in the workplace. That’s important—80% of breaches involve passwords—but our vision gradually evolved into an all-in-one platform to manage employee access.<p>First we built Passwordless MFA, a mobile app that replaces passwords with biometrics and certificates. You can login into any company resource - SSO portal, Windows or Mac desktop, Wi-Fi, VPN - with a simple Face ID scan. But behind the scenes we use a lot of technology to make our MFA unphishable and secure (FIDO2, hardware-backed crypto, device attestation, and more).<p>Second, we added a full-featured Single Sign-On Identity Provider. It is a web and mobile portal to centralize access to all apps and infrastructure. Unlike other Identity Providers that focus only on SAML SaaS applications, we added all resources to the same portal, so you can access apps, servers, databases and more from the same place. Today we support hundreds of SAML integrations, offer account provisioning, RBAC, auditing, group management and more.<p>Next, we added a password vault. Companies asked us to add a password management capability to safely store credentials, share amongst employees, and autofill on websites. But unlike other password managers, we do not use a master password. Instead you login into your vault (on desktop or mobile) with mobile biometrics such as Face ID. The vault is end to end encrypted, and your passwords can not be seen in our cloud.<p>Last but not least, we realized that SSO for cloud applications is solving only part of the problem, as engineers need to access hosted apps and compute infrastructure. As a result we added a cloud proxy to our platform to offer remote access to on-premises applications and SSH servers. Not only do we provide connectivity, but also handle authentication, authorization and auditing for infrastructure access. For example, we replace SSH passwords and keys with short-lived certificates. We will release RDP access shortly, and will then start adding database access to our platform.<p>Security is critical for us - we have been prioritizing security from day one. We are open with how our system is architected, and published all designs on our docs portal (<a href="https://docs.idemeum.com/mobile-app-security.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.idemeum.com/mobile-app-security.html</a>). We also conducted our first penetration test with Cure53 to validate our designs, crypto, and security principles. We are also SOC2 compliant.<p>We offer a free plan and would love your feedback if you give us a try: <a href="https://idemeum.com/try" rel="nofollow">https://idemeum.com/try</a>.<p>We would be very grateful to hear your feedback, ideas, and experiences from the identity and access management domain. Thank you!</p>

## Show HN: Villagers – A group travel app
 - [https://villagersapp.com/](https://villagersapp.com/)

<p>I've built Villagers, a group travel app, in an attempt to overcome my own social isolation while working remotely, especially as someone who's friends are now largely parents and much less available for group travel.<p>I find small group travel magical from an interpersonal and experience standpoint but organizing trips is absolutely brutal. With Villagers, I wanted to see if software could overcome some of those planning challenges with financial incentives, social features, and automation -- especially around messaging.<p>I love climbing, so I've built a trip to co-work and climb in Red Rocks (Nevada) in November.<p><a href="https://villagersapp.com/t/gkkfv" rel="nofollow">https://villagersapp.com/t/gkkfv</a><p>I'm looking for 4-8 high EQ tech folks who'd like to co-work and climb. Everyone's identity will be verified and I'll make sure it's a broad culture fit (i.e. polite, respectful, reasonably extroverted, etc.). We'll keep the costs down to less than $500 per person for 3 nights.<p>For more social proof before you join me on a trip, you can click through my profile on the trip page above to see my LinkedIn work history as an early engineer at Plaid and most recently the founder of a 70+ person company (Tremendous).</p>

## Ask HN: Do people not have hobbies anymore?

<p>It feels like every time someone gets into a new field now, there's always the expectation they'll 'go pro' or turn it into a day job. Every open source project or website gets treated as the potential basis for a company, every creative seems to think they'll become a full time artist or creator, every writer wants a book deal or mailing list or whatever...<p>And while there's nothing wrong with that, it feels like people have lost sight of what hobbies can be, and forgotten that something can just be a way to relax or destress instead. Hell, if you create anything, everyone will seemingly tell  you how much money you should be making from it, and encourage you to monetise it in some way or another.<p>So is there a reason for that? Has the financial situation forced everyone into always looking for a side hustle or way to 'escape the rat race'? Or is there some other explanation for why everything seems to need a financial reason to exist now?</p>

<p>I swear to god, the better the hotel, the worse the wifi.<p>If there's any kind of popup modal—they're doing it wrong. If there's any kind of pasword—they're doing it wrong.<p>If you are a startup that things you are "helping" hotels by helping them monetize their wifi or something, please pivot.<p>How do we spread the word?</p>

## Show HN: Keyboard Jobs – A job board which truly understands software developers

<p>Hi HN,<p>When my daughter got born this year I decided to take 6 months off to be at home with my new daughter and spend the first few months together with her and my wife to be hands on in those first few crucial months. Throughout that time I always kept an eye on the job market so I could stay in the loop and better gauge what my prospects would be to go back into work later, not least because of the economic turmoil.<p>However, I got immensely frustrated with existing job boards advertising software developer jobs. I didn't feel like they included a lot of information which engineers actually care about or even basic things like a salary range. Additionally I observed discussions on HN how increasingly more software engineers say they wouldn't want to work for a company anymore if they use technology X or Y. With that in mind I created Keyboard Jobs and launched it a few weeks ago.<p>So far I've been mostly talking friends at former companies I've worked with or sent cold emails with 100% discounted voucher codes to get the first jobs listed. It's been moderately successful but I am ready to gather more feedback on what hackers would love to see from a job board made for them!</p>

## Ask HN: Why isn't Dart more popular?

<p>Played around with a couple of the Google sponsored languages - Go and then Dart. Both exercised different parts of my brain but I feel like Dart has a much lower learning curve for anyone with Java/C# experience. I'm using it with Flutter and it's been great but wonder why it isn't more popular as a general purpose backend language?</p>
