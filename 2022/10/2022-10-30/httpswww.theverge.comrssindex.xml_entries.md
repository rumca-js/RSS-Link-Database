  <p id="zlpjoA">Twitter’s combatting an increase in hateful tweets after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/27/23184519/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-deal-complete-agreement">Elon Musk officially acquired the company</a> on Friday. Yoel Roth, the platform’s head of safety and integrity, <a href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel/status/1586542283469381632?s=20&amp;t=DBcGC9dN5tx6genIHHDfPg">said on Twitter</a> that the company’s taking action against an “organized effort” to spread hate speech on the platform.</p>
<p id="sLdhfG">According to Roth, a “small number” of accounts posted a rash of tweets containing “slurs and other derogatory terms” over the past two days, with the goal of making users think Twitter’s policies surrounding content moderation have changed. Roth says that just 300 accounts sent out over 50,000 tweets using a “particular slur,” and that almost all of the accounts in question are inauthentic. </p>

  <p id="pt6QeQ">Telegram removed the ability for users on iOS to create pay-to-view posts due to Apple’s strict App Store guidelines (<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/10/28/telegram-paid-posts-channels-apple-in-app-purchases/">via <em>9to5Mac</em></a>). In <a href="https://t.me/durov/199">a post on Telegram</a>, CEO Pavel Durov says creators on the platform have been using third-party payment or donation bots to sell access to certain posts on their channels, but that Apple was “not happy with content creators monetizing their efforts without paying a 30% tax to Apple.” </p>
<p id="zGWDLS">Apple doesn’t allow developers to use third-party payment processors in their apps and charges up to a 30 percent commission on any in-app purchases. As noted by <em>9to5Mac</em>, Telegram initially appeared to have been testing a paid posts feature, as <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1585678759935594496?s=20&amp;t=KZuiS4nzR3WqyCyQWBUSYg">spotted by social media consultant Matt Navarra</a>.

<p id="AlfCpb">As noted by Gurman, this release window would allow Apple to launch the new MacBooks around the same the macOS Ventura 13.3 and iOS 16.3 updates come out, which are expected sometime between early February and March. This prediction aligns with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/22/23316481/apple-m2-macbook-pro-14-16-release-q4">Ming-Chi Kuo's tweet from August</a> that suggests Apple could release the new MacBook Pros early next year, as well as a recent rumor from <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&amp;logNo=222914959301&amp;navType=by">Korean leaker Lanzuk (yeux1122)</a>, which also indicates the new...</p>
