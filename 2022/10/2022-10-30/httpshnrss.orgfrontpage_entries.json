19:52:03+00:00", "description": "<p>I don't usually go in for conspiracy theories, but this one seems pretty clear-cut and I can't see anyone else discussing it online: WhatsApp appears to be selectively censoring references to Signal.<p>Specifically, I had changed my profile picture on WhatsApp to the Signal logo and my \u2018About\u2019 text to \u2018Message me on Signal - https://signal.org/download/\u2019. However, I noticed recently (after someone happened to open their WhatsApp in front of me and I saw their chat with me) that my WhatsApp contacts are seeing my profile picture and my \u2018About\u2019 text as blank. I've checked and this seems to be the case for all of my WhatsApp contacts.<p>See screenshots from me and my friend's phones here: https://imgur.com/a/qvEsswW<p>On the bright side, this serves as an ideal demo for convincing anyone who doesn't understand why I am trying to migrate them over to Signal. So, I guess, <i>thanks</i> Meta?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33397973\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33397973</a></p>\n<p>Points: 32</p>\n<p>#

flow & UI, to the public.\nWe\u2019ve chosen to use Svelte so our flows would be lightweight (it is ~50kb gzipped).\nNext up:\n- Adding forms and components for it to be used as a full onboarding flow.\n- Releasing an open-source case management dashboard, for manual approval of users.\n- Releasing an open-source rule engine, to help automate decisions.\nWe\u2019d love to hear your feedback, suggestions, or any question you\u2019ve got.\nAnd if the rest of the project is relevant or interesting to you, follow us and, we\u2019ll update you once new things are available.\nThanks!</p>\n<hr

something like 'you may be wondering why you are getting this, do not worry, I got your email from our internal CRM' -- ..ok that's fine then?! No mention of how it got <i>there</i>. No idea why Cummins thinks it's how he specifically got my email address to use in a work capacity that might be a concern, or why 'from my employer' would be a useful answer.<p>It's incessant, and sure it has an 'unsubscribe' link but of course I never subscribed to your 'tell me how paying for Datadog might benefit me' spam, I shouldn't have to unsubscribe.<p>I assume many others here are getting this crap too?<p>If you happen to work at Datadog, I'd suggest telling the relevant teams that this sort of thing is only going to make people <i>not</i> use Datadog's services. (Or frankly, just tell Craig Cummins if that's a real employee's name - it's always him.)
