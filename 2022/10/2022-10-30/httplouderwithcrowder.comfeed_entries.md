Reminder: the new owner of one of the (alleged) most powerful communications platforms in the world <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-responds-elon-musk" target="_blank">is a Ron DeSantis supporter</a>.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Reminder: The Owners of Facebook, Instagram, Shopify, Tumblr, Apple, Twitch, Buffer, YouTube, Google, and Judd Legum‚Äôs mom are all Joe Biden supporters. <a href="https://t.co/TK5zdgwHaP">https://t.co/TK5zdgwHaP</a><br />‚Äî Brodigan Prime Plus (@brodigan) <a href="https://twitter.com/brodigan/status/1586342457620729857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>It won't be 75%, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-twitter-open-letter" target="_blank">as was rumored</a>. It won't be 69%, which would be hysterical. And it's mathematically impossible for Elon Musk to lay off 420% of the Twitter workforce. But according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/29/technology/twitter-layoffs-musk-jobs.html" target="_blank">Musk-hating New York Times</a>, we could see up to 50% of Twitter's workforce being wished well in their future endeavors.</p><p>Elon is  said to have ‚Äúordered the cuts across the company, with some teams to be trimmed more than others." Also,  ‚Äúsome managers are being asked to draw up lists of employees to cut.‚Äù</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>But where do you cut from such a well-run company? As reported by the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-employee-vlog" target="_blank">every Twitter employee is invaluable, performs crucial tasks, and is harder working than any hard working employee anywhere ever</a>. I can't begin to imagine to burden on Elon Musk right now being forced to choose between crucial employees. Though, if the Chief Twit is forced to perform such an unfortunate task, he might know where to start.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Just received this email from Twitter. This is an actual, real email that was autogenerated ü§£ü§£ <a href="https://t.co/7DQp4sNINX">pic.twitter.com/7DQp4sNINX</a><br />‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1586680643831836677?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>If there is a silver lining, as Twitter employees transition to being unemployed, at least they won't need to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/learn-code-meme" target="_blank">learn to code</a> to find a new job. They should know how to do that. Plus, I'm sure Facebook is always looking for new talent with expertise in throttling opposing viewpoints.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Sisters spray mother with water every time she 'misgenders,' somehow don't think they're the bad guys

She doesn't catch people off guard and take them out of context like a corporate journalismer does. LoTT finds the content leftists create on their own and shares it with the world. Content that the creators, while they upload it, think in their brains makes them the good guys. Like, for example, two sisters who spray their mother with water over the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cat-pronouns-video" target="_blank">crime of misgendering</a>.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">These siblings made a ‚Äúspray bottle policy‚Äù and spray their mom with water every time she misgenders them <a href="https://t.co/tjsLqPZkyQ">pic.twitter.com/tjsLqPZkyQ</a><br />‚Äî Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) <a href="https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1586570755575148545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Somehow, these two sisters do not think they're the assholes here.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="faf85" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32019864&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Now, some of you may be confused. Is this the partner being <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bbc-quotes-rape-victim-pronouns" target="_blank">misgendered</a>, or is this the misgendering mother?</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="82dc4" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32019865&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>It's the mother. LoTT combined two clips in her video report. In the caption of the second half of the video originally uploaded to the communist China-owned social media platform known as TikTok, the other sister says "Accountability is the cost of proclaiming yourself an ally."</p><p>So this is a mother who considers herself an ally, who her daughters consider ally-ish, and who tries her best to be an ally. But she isn't ally enough for her daughters. So she gets the spray bottle.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="bee7f" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32019867&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you are gay, straight, or whatever else. Putting your mother on blast like this and bragging about makes you either a biyatch or a d*ckhead. I wouldn't want to misgender anyone. So choose your gender, choose the insult that corresponds with your chosen gender, and know that you are a bad person.</p><p><p>

In the middle of this concert to raise money for Florida residents affected by a Florida hurricane, Bryan invited Florida's governor on stage. Ron DeSantis. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-biden-hurricane-ian" target="_blank">Perhaps you heard of him</a>.</p><p>Florida country music fans roared with approval for their popular governor:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">DeSantis just walked out on stage at Luke Bryan.

They're very upset with the artist and swear they will never listen to his music ever again. Whether or not any of them ever listened to Bryan before or could name any songs is open for debate.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/LJMalcom/status/1586473132965056513" target="_blank">One person</a> with a Ukraine flag profile picture and a Ukraine flag emoji in her name cries: "I am so dismayed that you had DeSantis on stage with you. He embodies what is wrong with humanity; he pulls stunts that are racist and he is truly an evil man with no soul. I can no longer listen to your music in good conscious, you are a huge disappointment. "</p><p>Another person, when Luke Bryan said "ladies and gentlemen, Ron DeSantis" <a href="https://twitter.com/AmandaK982/status/1586474802130620416" target="_blank">misheard him and seems to think he said</a> "I hate women, LGBTQ people and immigrants."</p><p>Then come the potty mouths. <a href="https://twitter.com/lisa_liberal/status/1586418770582548482" target="_blank">One woman with the mouth of a truck driver said</a> "Well Luke Bryan can f@ck all the way off now."</p><p>But at least she censored herself. Another broad <a href="https://twitter.com/73MilitaryMama/status/1586455401897205760" target="_blank">with a Ukraine Flag emoji AND a schmaccine emoji</a> in her name did not: "Sad and seriously disappointing. F*ck you Luke Bryan."</p><p>And, some dinkus <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealHoarse/status/1586474298495016960" target="_blank">who claims to whisper to horses</a> whined: "Congrats to <a href="https://twitter.com/lukebryan" target="_blank">@lukebryan</a> on announcing he‚Äôs a bigoted piece of shit."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>Fresh off of this bird app slacktivism, Ron DeSantis paid a visit to the most magical place on Earth -- Long Island -- to campaign for future governor Lee Zeldin.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">NY deserves a leader who will restore law & order. <a href="https://twitter.com/leezeldin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@leezeldin</a> is the man for the job.<br /><br />Lee will also protect NYers against irrational & liberty-infringing COVID mandates.<br /><br />The Zeldin victory on Nov 8th will be a shot heard ‚Äòround the world!<br /><br />Support him:<a href="https://t.co/o1ZqqMuBBZ">https://t.co/o1ZqqMuBBZ</a> <a href="https://t.co/SZol7Plwu2">pic.twitter.com/SZol7Plwu2</a><br />‚Äî Ron DeSantis (@RonDeSantisFL) <a href="https://twitter.com/RonDeSantisFL/status/1586556231803707393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Luke Bryan went on to the next town and another sold-out audience.</p><p>And the idiots complaining about the DeSantis cameo went back to complaining about Elon Musk. </p><p>All remains right in the world.</p><p><p>
