Google has also agreed to change some of its practices, primarily concerning how it informs users about collecting, storing and using their location data.</p><p>\u201cGoogle leads consumers to believe that consumers are in control of whether Google collects and retains information about their location and how that information is used,\u201d the complaint, which Racine filed in January, read. \u201cIn reality, consumers who use Google products cannot prevent Google from collecting, storing and profiting from their location.\u201d</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Racine's office also accused Google of employing &quot;dark patterns,&quot; which are design choices intended to deceive users into carrying out actions that don't benefit them. Specifically, the AG's office claimed that Google repeatedly prompted users to switch in location tracking in certain apps and informed them that certain features wouldn't work properly if location tracking wasn't on. Racine and his team found that location data wasn't even needed for the app in question. They asserted that Google made it &quot;impossible for users to opt out of having their location tracked.&quot;</p><p>The $9.5 million payment is a paltry one for Google. Last quarter, it took parent company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/alphabet/\"><ins>Alphabet</ins></a> under 20 minutes to make that much in revenue. The changes that the company will make to its practices as part of <a href=\"https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2022-12/2022.12.29%20DC-Google%20Settlement%20Agreement%20%5Bfor%20signature%5D.pdf\">the settlement</a> may have a bigger impact.</p><p>Folks who currently have certain location settings on will receive notifications telling them how they can disable each setting, delete the associated data and limit how long Google can keep that information. Users who set up a new Google account will be informed which location-related account settings are on by default and offered the chance to opt out.</p><p>Google will need to maintain a webpage that details its location data practices and policies. This will include ways for users to access their location settings and details about how each setting impacts Google's collection, retention or use of location data.</p><p>Moreover, Google will be prevented from sharing a person's precise location data with a third-party advertiser without the user's explicit consent. The company will need to delete location data &quot;that came from a device or from an IP address in web and app activity within 30 days&quot; of obtaining the information</p><p>&quot;Given the vast level of tracking and surveillance that technology companies can embed into their widely used products, it is only fair that consumers be informed of how important user data, including information about their every move, is gathered, tracked, and utilized by these companies,&quot; Racine said in a statement. &quot;Significantly, this resolution also provides users with the ability and choice to opt of being tracked, as well as restrict the manner in which user information may be shared with third parties.&quot;</p><p>Engadget has contacted Google for comment.</p>", "album": null},

Since more than a decade I've been using an always-on VPN on all my devices through a VPS I operate (various cloud providers along the years).\nAlso for context, I stopped using all google services around 2015 or thereabouts - although I still have an account I no longer use it.\nThe only google service that I use rarely is google maps - of course, never logged on.\nAnd a few times a month I use google search for the odd obscure thing.<p>Around 2016 was the first time I noticed that google.com was showing at the bottom of the page my ZIP code. It felt very unusual but I was in the process of moving so I didn't pay too much attention. To my surprise, a few weeks later google.com was showing my new ZIP code.<p>I shopped around for cloud providers that would allow me to rotate the instance IP easily and thankfully there are many but I was curious how come google picked it up - the only plausible reason was using location data from the Google Maps iOS app.<p>Here's how you can replicate this.<p>Get a cheap VPS from a country different than yours. Get an iOS device (ideally an (older?) iPhone but I think it should work on an iPad) - Android devices should be excluded from this test for obvious reasons.\nReset it to factory defaults (optional but removes moving parts and false leads like cookies etc).<p>Install wireguard (or your preferred always-on vpn) and configure the VPS to be used as an exit node.\nInstall google maps (don't login of course) - can be used without being logged on just fine.\nInstall firefox focus (Safari in Private Window mode would work as well).<p>Confirm via ipinfo (or your preferred whatsmyip website) that you're using the VPS IP\nGo to google.com and confirm it's showing at the bottom of the page the country of the VPS (could also be shown in a different language if google has a presence in that country).<p>Use the google maps app a few times a day (ideally navigate from a place to another) - it will take about 2-3 weeks but you'll notice that google.com will now show your actual country for the VPS IP and also the google.com language will change to your own.<p>If you want to take it one step further, continue to use google maps on the iOS device. You'll notice that after a few more weeks, google.com will show your actual City (based on the IP) - and after a while longer it will be even more precise, will show your ZIP code.<p>You have to be patient though, it will take 2-4 weeks to start with - and it's imperative that that IP address is dedicated to this test.<p>Funny enough, I was on holiday on Mexico for a month right before reading the HN article I mentioned (have been using a VPS in the states for lower latency) and I noticed that after 2 weeks the language changed to Spanish and google.com was showing Mexico (I rotated the IP when this happened and it prompted me to write this 'Tell HN'.<p>Not surprisingly but Google doesn't share the new GeoIP data - MaxMind, ipinfo and others never changed their location data for that IP - they showed the original geoip even a few weeks after google changed theirs - haven't checked longer than that - it could be shared eventually.<p>In conclusion - I can't say that I'm surprised Google is using the Maps location data - and I don't think there's any way to prevent it (outside of not running Maps - but unfortunately it's one of the few ways of checking restaurant reviews).\nMy \"workaround\" is to periodically rotate my VPS IP and move on with life :)<p>Thanks for reading - I hope you found this useful.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34052786\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34052786</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["elon musk"], "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2022-12-19T11:51:04.032922+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/elon-musk-asked-his-twitter-followers-if-he-should-step-down-as-the-company-s-ceo-57-5-voted-yes/ar-AA15rBNV?li=BBnbcA1&srcref=rss", "language": "en-US", "age": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": true, "artist": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "http://www.msn.com/rss/news.aspx", "title": "Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers if he should step down as the company's CEO. 57.5% voted 'yes.'", "thumbnail": null, "description": "", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["digital dementia", "life balance"], "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2022-12-19T11:08:16+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/19/in-2022-i-decided-to-get-away-from-screens-and-read-more-books-it-was-wonderful", "language": "en-US", "age": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": true, "artist": null, "source_obj__id": 85, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "In 2022, I decided to get away from screens and read more books.

these records to attain universal and specific knowledge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blockchain-as-akashic-record\">Blockchain as Akashic Record</h2>\n<p>To explain aloud Leonardo&rsquo;s subtle joke: blockchains, as they come to maturity, are functioning as Akashic Records of our own invention.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain is a necessarily public ledger of all past transactions, the origin of their funds, the wallets they interact with and more.\nPeople often erroneously think that the &ldquo;crypto&rdquo; in cryptocurrency means that information about it is somehow &ldquo;cryptic&rdquo; or hidden, but this is just ignorance.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin is substantially worse for privacy than even the most corporate credit cards, since even then credit cards don&rsquo;t broadcast your transactions publicly on the internet as bitcoin must do for all submitted transactions.</p>\n<p>As time has gone on and projects such has Ethereum have developed, blockchain technology is employing these public ledgers for an ever wide range of tasks:\ndecentralized computing, contracting and much more&hellip;</p>\n<p><strong>If blockchains continue developing as they are, they will gradually record and make publicly available every transaction, action and for that matter&mdash;idle word of every human.</strong>\nThere are projects and coins for every segment of digital life, including storing and accessing files, watching videos, interacting with the internet of things and more.\nA combination of greed, stupidity and neophilia are leading us to disaster world that might not be able to be undone.</p>\n<p>The technologization of society is accelerating for most.\nLess and less of human life occurs without the filter, approval and overwatch of internet-connected technology.\nAs more of this becomes part of &ldquo;the Blockchain,&rdquo; more of it becomes an issue of common knowledge.</p>\n<p>A normal human reacts in fear at the idea that God the Dread Judge has a Book of Life with all actions and thoughts of all men and will judge them accordingly.\nA delusional theosophist might pine for the power that such knowledge would give them over others, but they needn&rsquo;t pine long, since this is exactly the weaponry we are creating and leaving in the open with blockchain technology&hellip;</p>\n<h2 id=\"technology-and-will-to-power\">Technology and Will-to-Power</h2>\n<p>The greatest threat to good programming, human freedom and humanity itself is the love of technology just for technology&rsquo;s sake.</p>\n<p>There is no shortage of visionary programmers who can imagine niche uses for novel technology.\nBut unfortunately for these people &ldquo;Can I?&rdquo; is a common question, but &ldquo;Should I?&rdquo; is fairly rare.</p>\n<p>Pride and lust for power are the true motivations of many visionary programmers.\nIt doesn&rsquo;t feel like &ldquo;lust for power&rdquo; when you experience it, but there is a very Nietzschean muscle a programmer exercises when he sees a large and exploitable dataset.\nWhen you see masses of metadata, and you know you have the means at your fingertips to create something &ldquo;new&rdquo; with it, the temptation is almost always too difficult to resist.</p>\n<p>Only the most mercenary and depraved programmer sets out to write software to enslave.\nStill, when even a semi-competent programmer sees an interesting dataset of GPS coordinates, cell-phone metadata, Bitcoin transaction data or something else, there often arises an insatiable desire to deploy this dataset in a &ldquo;clever&rdquo; and &ldquo;useful&rdquo; way.</p>\n<p>This is the pinnacle of the &ldquo;useful idiot&rdquo; phenomenon.\nIn design alone, the technology is morally and socially inert, <strong>but no technology is morally or socially inert in implementation.</strong>\nThis is even more the case when many evil actors, governments, the media, organized power weaponize &ldquo;clever&rdquo; and &ldquo;useful&rdquo; projects to actualize private and hidden goals.</p>\n<p>There is a deep undercurrent in modernity to have &ldquo;smart&rdquo; technology.\nRefrigerators and appliances often now connect to the internet and download software patches from their vendors.\nSimple finger-operated light switches have apparently been ruled pass\u00e9, while voice-operated light switches that communicate with Amazon servers are the new thing.</p>\n<p>The reason that people like Richard Stallman continue ending up sounding prophetic about the dangerous of proprietary software is because they are serious enough to realize that <strong>programming is the closest mankind has ever come to wizardry and dark arts.</strong>\nWith such supreme power and with such a lack of oversight (either by writing closed-source code or otherwise), even the most noble programmer can be easily seduced into flexing their Will-to-Power to do the absurd.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-antichrist-and-digital-hyperreality\">The Antichrist and Digital Hyperreality</h2>\n<p>As we further encroach creating the Akashic Records by hand,\nthis all might remind you of that one Voltaire quote&hellip;</p>\n<p>You know, that one that millennial gamers will know from the ending of <em>Deus Ex</em> if you decide to merge yourself with the omniscient and omnipotent AI panopticon:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"titleimg\"><a href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/invent-him.jpg\"><img alt=\"If there were no God, it would be necessary to invent him.\" src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/invent-him.jpg\" title=\"If there were no God, it would be necessary to invent him.\" /></a><figcaption>If there were no God, it would be necessary to invent him.</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>The zeitgeist of modernity is certainly atheistic, but at the same time, every movement in it seems to bend like pliable reeds to the desire to create a &ldquo;God&rdquo; of its own design.</p>\n<p>Positivism rejects or scientifically dismisses the very metaphysical reality of &ldquo;truth&rdquo; and &ldquo;falsity&rdquo; themselves.\nIt then encourages the assumptive jump from personal or informational subjectivity <em>to the denial of transcendent objectivity altogether</em>.\nSince this is an absurd crime even against logic, <strong>we have a natural deep-seated desire to instead create a new layer of reality on which objective and undeniable truth can be restored.</strong>\nThis is the newly created digital realm.\nThis is man&rsquo;s electronic equivalent of God&rsquo;s &ldquo;Book of Life&rdquo; which logs all truth in digital databases and blockchains.</p>\n<p>Actual reality is messy, organic and is perceived subjectively&mdash;And mankind is only a part of that creation.\nBut in the digital world, we can arrange our new lives with inviolable programs and smart contracts that have a new enforced objectivity.</p>\n<p>Mankind is creator and omnipotent in this lesser reality, but our desire for power is so great that we want to elevate this lesser reality to something greater than reality itself.\nWouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to have the kinds of superpowers we can achieve with computer programming in our waking lives?\nIf so, why not insert our waking consciousnesses into this reduced reality to wield this fantasy power?</p>\n<p>Worst of all, you now have a class of Jordan Petersonian &ldquo;intellects&rdquo; denigrating and obfuscating reality to such a degree as to make the new digital Antichrist sounds like it was what we were talking about the whole time!\nGod has been reduced to and confused with &ldquo;the idea of God&rdquo; or &ldquo;the most powerful thing in creation.&rdquo;\nThe mentalistic world of archetypes has become the world of digital imagination, which is now held up as a replacement for the very idea of reality beyond atoms bumping into each other.\nWe&rsquo;re all theosophists!\nWe&rsquo;re all Free Masons now!</p>\n<p>It is now held as an ideal to <em>create</em> our &ldquo;Creator&rdquo; and imbue digital technology with as much power and omniscience as possible.\nPeople will soon unironically call themselves religious because they worship a created techno-god because they have been duped into believing this is what &ldquo;God&rdquo; always meant.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"titleimg\"><img src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/musk-page-helios.webp\" /><figcaption>Deus Ex was a dystopian video game, not an instructional manual. (Looking at you, Elon Musk.)</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s naturally common for Christians to interpret the singular final antichrist to be an individual person, but at this point, a much more obvious &ldquo;beast system&rdquo; to marvel at is a technological system in itself consummated in something that looks like God.</p>\n<h2 id=\"transhumanism-and-singularity-as-pattern-extrapolation\">Transhumanism and Singularity as Pattern Extrapolation</h2>\n<p>This entire budding techno-futurist religion has a simple origin.\nThe human mind sees patterns.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"titleimg\"><a href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/xkcd-extrapolating.png\"><img src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/xkcd-extrapolating.png\" title=\"Apologies for the use of XKSoyD.\" /></a></figure>\n\n<p>In every moment of history, every society manages to &ldquo;see patterns&rdquo; by extrapolating the past presented to them, just adding on a couple extra steps (also presented to them).\nDo not mistake your extrapolation of recent events to be a foundational direction of the universe.</p>\n<p>For example, John von Neumann, the most notable polymath of the 20th century took the geometric proliferation of nuclear arms and their Game Theoretics seriously&mdash;<strong>and unironically recommended immediate nuclear war.</strong>\nHis obituary in <em>Life</em> (Feb 25, 1957; p. 96) says of his thinking the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[He] observed at that time: &ldquo;With the Russians it is not a question of whether but when.&rdquo; A hard-boiled strategist, he was one of the few scientists to advocate for preemptive war, and in 1950 he was remarking, &ldquo;If you say why not bomb them tomorrow, I say why not today? If you say today at 5 o&rsquo;clock, I say why not 1 o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thankfully most people lacked the iron-clad logic of von Neumann and we avoided nuclear holocaust.</p>\n<p>In our modern world, this lazy tendency of extrapolation often manifests in a kind of <em>Transhumanism</em> or belief in technological &ldquo;Singularity&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>This is a utopian or millenarian belief that we can eternally extrapolate geometric increases in increased technological or computational power to a point where technological improvement becomes instant, effortless, yet infinite.\nTechnology seems to have significantly accelerated in human life, so it seems to these people that we should assume it continues to do so, apparently with the idea that there is no factor in human psychology, physiological, neuroscience or even economy that could ever be a principled boundary for this tumorous growth.</p>\n<p>Transhumanists, as their name suggests, ultimately believe in what they might glowingly describe as humans &ldquo;transcending their biology and psychology&rdquo; or other cloudy terms.\nIn reality, these people are pining for the death of humanity, or as some absurdly put it, &ldquo;human civilization surviving [sic] in human-created AI.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"titleimg\"><img src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/having-fun.webp\" /><figcaption>This is actually the best case scenario of 'transhumanism.' If you think this comic is weird, wait until there are Matrix-style warehouses of pod-people hooked up to auto-masturbators. Acutally, you'll realize in some senses, they're already here.</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>They imagine husks of biological humanity, perfectly climate-controlled by vaccines, &ldquo;augmentations,&rdquo; and directly-injected stimulation and entertainment, embedded in a casket of metal for their entire lives.\nThey imagine human-created robots, then totally de-tethered from their creators, exploring the universe and installing robot colonies on distant planets.\nIn some perverted way, they call this genocidal conquest of humanity <em>humanity</em> itself, or humanity &ldquo;improved.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This is the Gnostic Heresy reborn, but worse than original Gnostics, who at least believed in the structure beyond matter, and who consistently denigrated matter compared to it.\nThese new Gnostics believe in creating this realm of ideas, but destroying and mutilating the human mind and body that they believe to be the very metric of value of this new realm.\nIn a literal sense, they want to destroy nature, mankind and the universe as they know it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cucked-by-inevitability\">Cucked by &ldquo;Inevitability&rdquo;</h2>\n<p>Transhumanists take a page from Marx&rsquo;s book in passing of their true desire as being a scientific &ldquo;inevitability.&rdquo;\nThey argue that singularity <em>will</em> happen, therefore, by some leap of logic, it <em>should</em>, or even its many consequences or birth-pangs are therefore <em>good</em>.\nThis is absurd.</p>\n<p>If, after all, an asteroid were hurdling towards this planet capable of wiping out human life, only a moron refuse to act saying that &ldquo;It&rsquo;s inevitable,&rdquo; or &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the clear direction of history.&rdquo;\nAt that, the trajectory of an asteroid is an issue of math, while any alleged trajectory of history is an issue of pure fantasy.</p>\n<p>I mention this to say that transhumanists often try to pass of their fantasies of the future as being &ldquo;inevitable,&rdquo; when in fact, they are merely titillating ideas that appeal to their imaginations formed for years under the influence of interesting fantasy futurism in film, fiction and modern culture.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-our-state-of-affairs\">So, our state of affairs&hellip;</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The influence of technology is at a local high point now.

In fact, you're being told two main lies: the first is how high inflation actually is. But the second is who is truly responsible for a large part of inflation happening.\n\nWhen we hear about inflation, we're told that it's primarily caused by the simple economics of money in the system. More money is printed, resulting in dollars becoming devalued, resulting in stuff getting more expensive. And yes, this is definitely a part of the inflation equation. However, there's a part that's often missed that in many cases, causes prices around us to rise as well.\n\nTo put it simply, it's all about corporate greed. And the desire of many companies to use inflation as a cover story for rising prices, so they can line their pockets. It's only possible they can do this due to lack of competition, which is something we don't think we have in today's world.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts below.\n\n0:00 - The big lies about inflation\n0:55 - LIE 1: How high inflation really is\n3:00 - The main narrative around inflation\n3:26 - LIE 2: What is causing inflation\n5:17 - Why competition is a myth\n6:59 - Concentration of corporate power\n\n\u25ba IMPORTANT LINKS:\nEnter your email via the link below for free weekly lessons and insights into becoming financially free, investing, global tax and corporate structures, passports, residencies, and more.\nJOIN: https://www.abundantia.co/\n\n\u25ba SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u2022 Abundantia Instagram: @abundantia.co https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/\n\u2022 Sorelle's Instagram: @sorelleamore  https://instagram.com/sorelleamore\n\u2022 Leon's Instagram: @leonhill  https://instagram.com/leonhill\n\u2022 Abundantia Twitter: https://twitter.com/abundantiaco\n\u2022 Abundantia Facebook: http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance\n\nSorelle and Leon.\nFounders, Abundantia\n\nLiability Disclaimer: https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer\n*We may earn a commission if you buy any products or services via the links in this video's description.

You could opt out of targeted ads on Facebook or Instagram if you'd rather not have the social networks track your activity. You can already decline customized ads using data from third-party apps and sites.</p><p>The board's decision wouldn't directly force Meta to change. Rather, it would ask Ireland's Data Protection Commission to apply matching orders. As Meta's European operations are officially based in Ireland, the company would have to comply.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Both data boards acknowledged that there had been decisions, but didn't comment on what they entailed. We've asked Meta for comment. A spokesperson for the social media giant said it was \"too early to speculate,\" and that the EU might still offer legal backing for targeted ads. The company argued that it had \"fully\" engaged with the Data Protection Commission's inquiries.</p><p>If the EU does restrict Meta's personalization, it could have a significant impact on the company's bottom line. With fewer users willing to accept targeted ads, there may be fewer people clicking those ads and encouraging advertisers to spend more on campaigns. Meta was already worried about <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-ios-app-tracking-notices-192117307.html\">Apple's App Tracking Transparency</a>, and warned that it might cost $10 billion in sales when it launched in 2021. The reported European measure could also prove costly, especially as it would affect Android and the web.</p><p>The EU might not be very sympathetic, as its officials have penalized Meta more than once for purported privacy violations. It faced a $402 million fine in September over allegedly illegal <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-fined-405-million-euro-instagram-privacy-161348122.html\">child privacy settings on Instagram</a>, and just last month received a $277 million fine for supposedly inadequate <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-fined-265-million-euros-over-data-scraping-142937633.html\">safeguards against data scraping</a>. That's on top of an investigation into <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/eu-uk-probe-google-meta-ad-collusion-jedi-blue-113239217.html\">possible collusion with Google</a> on display ads.

CBDC stands for Central Bank Digital Currency, and is a new form of digital money that is on the horizon for just about every nation on Earth.\n\nCBDCs have already been launched fully in 11 countries, but are being tested in more than 100, including in nations that account for more than 95% of our planet's total GDP. In other words, if a CBDC hasn't hit your country yet, it very likely will soon. The criticism around CBDCs is that they will be used as the ultimate tool of surveillance and control, allowing governments to monitor citizens' every move. However, the United States and the Netherlands are already implementing laws to do just that, potentially requiring new reporting standards on almost all transactions.\n\nThe truth is, there may not be a lot we can do to stop a CBDC from arriving in our nations. But we can refuse to use one when they arrive, if they are as terrible for financial freedom as many believe.\n\nIn any case, I would love to hear your thoughts. And thank you for being here for 100 videos on this channel.\n\n0:00 - A world of financial control\n1:19 - New Dutch and American surveillance laws\n2:35 - CBDCs are coming soon\n5:29 - NordVPN insert\n6:53 - Concerns surrounding CBDCs\n9:51 - Controlling people with money\n11:18 - What can we do?\n\n\u25ba IMPORTANT LINKS:\nEnter your email via the link below for free weekly lessons and insights into becoming financially free, investing, global tax and corporate structures, passports, residencies, and more.\nJOIN: https://www.abundantia.co/\n\n\u25ba SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u2022 Abundantia Instagram: @abundantia.co https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/\n\u2022 Sorelle's Instagram: @sorelleamore  https://instagram.com/sorelleamore\n\u2022 Leon's Instagram: @leonhill  https://instagram.com/leonhill\n\u2022 Abundantia Twitter: https://twitter.com/abundantiaco\n\u2022 Abundantia Facebook: http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance\n\nSorelle and Leon.\nFounders, Abundantia\n\nLiability Disclaimer: https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer\n*We may earn a commission if you buy any products or services via the links in this video's description.

It\u2019s to construct  \"large packages\" of essential services, including communal canteens. Previously, we reported that the Chinese government has been expanding supply and distribution cooperatives throughout the country. These are all signs that the planned economy version 2.0 is starting up in China after the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party ended.   \nIt showed that the Communist Party at that time wanted not only to implement a system of full and unrestricted public ownership in order to control the political and economic life of the entire society but also to impose a communal lifestyle, forcing its way into the private sphere and controlling the decisions of individual life.\n\nHave questions?

Peterson and Dr. Yoram Hazony discuss the major problems plaguing today's youths, such as the resurgence of Marxism under the guise of woke morality, the creation of aimless social hierarchies that leave participants devoid of meaning, and the complete lack of respect for adverse thinking that has lead to the deterioration of our foundational principles.\n \nDr. Yoram Hazony is an Israeli author,  philosopher, political theorist, and Bible scholar. In 1994, Dr. Hazony founded the Shalem Center in Jerusalem, which became Shalem College in 2013. Being the first liberal arts college in Israel, it attracted widespread attention, followed by much acclaim as many of the country's renowned intellectuals joined its staff. Hazony has also served as director of the John Templeton Foundation's project in Jewish Philosophical Theology, as well as a member of the Israel Council for Higher Education committee. Dr. Hazony has published many books, his 2018 work, The Virtue of Nationalism, being awarded Conservative Book of the Year in 2019. He also maintains a regularly published blog, Jerusalem Letters, that explores the topics of philosophy, politics, Judaism, Israel, and higher education. Other writings by Dr. Hazony have been published in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and American Affairs.\n\n\u2014Links\u2014 \n\nFor Dr. Yoram Hazony:\n\nGet your copy of

"description": "<p>As recently as early last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was considering using NSO Group\u2019s infamous Pegasus spyware in criminal investigations, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/12/us/politics/fbi-pegasus-spyware-phones-nso.html\"><ins>reports </ins><em><ins>The New York Times</ins></em></a>. Between late 2020 and early 2021, agency officials were in the \u201cadvanced\u201d stages of developing plans to brief FBI leadership on the software, according to internal bureau documents and court records seen by <em>The Times</em>. Those documents also reveal the bureau had developed guidelines for federal prosecutors detailing how the FBI\u2019s use of Pegasus would need to be disclosed during court cases.</p><p>Based on the documents, it\u2019s unclear if the FBI had considered using the spyware against American citizens. Earlier this year, <em>The Times </em>found that the agency had tested Phantom, a version of Pegasus that can target phones with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nso-group-spyware-us-state-department-report-183647765.html\"><ins>US numbers</ins></a>.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>By July 2021, the FBI eventually decided not to use Pegasus in criminal investigations. That\u2019s the same month that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/\"><em><ins>The</ins></em><ins>&nbsp;</ins><em><ins>Washington Post</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>published an investigation that claimed the software had been used to compromise the phones of two women close to murdered Saudi journalist <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nso-spyware-targeted-journalists-politicians-190234376.html\"><ins>Jamal Khashoggi</ins></a>. A few months later, the US placed Pegasus creator NSO Group on the Commerce Department\u2019s entity list, a designation that prevents US companies from conducting business with the firm. Despite the decision not to use Pegasus, the FBI indicated it remains open to using spyware in the future.</p><p>\u201cJust because the FBI ultimately decided not to deploy the tool in support of criminal investigations does not mean it would not test, evaluate and potentially deploy other similar tools for gaining access to encrypted communications used by criminals,\u201d states a <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/nso-fbi-brief/f6199b0802b4fc01/full.pdf\"><ins>legal briefing</ins></a> filed by the FBI last month.</p><p>The documents appear to present a different picture of the agency\u2019s interest in Pegasus than the one FBI Director Chris Wray shared with Congress during a closed-doors hearing this past December. \u201cIf you mean have we used it in any of our investigations to collect or target somebody, the answer is - as I\u2019m assured - no,\u201d he <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/fbi-nso/58a69830f3cd2e7d/full.pdf\"><ins>said in response to a question from Senator Ron Wyden</ins></a>. \u201cThe reason why I hedge, and I want to be transparent, that we have acquired some of their tools for research and development.

In all, Walt Disney added 14.6 million subscriptions for Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, bringing its total number of streaming subscribers so far to around 236 million. While Disney+ alone with its 164 million subscribers have yet to reach Netflix numbers, all three of the company's services combined had amassed members that can rival the streaming giant's.

Disney+ experienced more losses within the period due to higher production and technology costs, as well as an increase in marketing expenses. There were also no Premier Access releases for the quarter, such as last year's <em>Black Widow</em> and <em>Jungle Cruise</em>. That said, the losses were offset in part by higher subscription costs, which will become even higher in December.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Walt Disney CEO Bob Chapek said that the company expects its streaming losses to narrow going forward, thanks to its price increases and the launch of an ad-supported tier on Disney+.

For years, Lebanon encouraged foreign investment with the promise of high interest rates, but the war in neighbouring Syria and then the pandemic meant that when investors took fright, the whole financial system came tumbling down.

After analyzing LFR use by the Metropolitan (Met) and South Wales police, researchers concluded that the technology should be banned for use in \"all public spaces.\"</p><p>LFR pairs faces captured by security cameras to database photos to find matches. China and other non-democratic regimes have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-07-us-entity-list-chinese-facial-recognition-video-surveillance.html\">used the technology</a> to as part of their state surveillance tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>UK police have been <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-24-london-police-live-facial-recognition-public-streets.html\">testing its use</a> in multiple situations to fight crime and terrorism.

That has in turn made it difficult to determine whether the tools are promoting racial profiling, while raising questions about accountability. \"Police forces are not necessarily answerable or held responsible for harms caused by facial recognition technology,\" said lead author Evani Radiya-Dixit.</p><p>The Met has claimed that the latest algorithms have improved LRF accuracy, with false alerts less than .08 percent, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/27/live-facial-recognition-police-study-uk\"><em>The Guardian</em></a>. They boasted of a 70 percent success rate up to 2020, but an expert from the University of Essex hired by the police force found it was actually just 19 percent.  \"That the court of appeal explicitly stated in 2020 that South Wales police use of this technology was 'unlawful' makes it difficult to argue this technology should be used,\" he said.</p><p>However, the Met said its work was supported by law. \"LFR is regulated by a number of sources of law. These sources of law combine to provide a multilayered legal structure to use, regulate and oversee the use of LFR by law enforcement bodies,\" it told <em>The Guardian</em>.

It's basically a description of the extension and a list of what it wants to do on your browser.\n\nAs of now, most browser extensions use manifest V2, and, as with all specifications, manifest v2 is being updated with manifest v3. Its biggest changes are in using service workers instead of background pages, and using a new API to block or modify network requests.\n\nThe new API is where the problem with manifest v3 lies.\n\nRight now, with manifest v2, extensions have access to a feature called WebRequest. To summarize it quickly, it lets the extension look at the data going through a web browser, notably the calls it makes to various URLs, and it lets extensions act on them, stuff like blocking them, or modifying them.\n\nThis feature is the backbone of all privacy and adblocking extensions.\n\nIn Manifest v3, pushed heavily by Google, the Web Request API is gone. It's replaced by a new one called Declarative Net Request, and this new API basically prevents any extension from monitoring traffic. Extensions must declare in advance how they'll  handle certain types of requests, or they can't handle them at all. These extensions also won't be able to load code from outside of the currently displayed website.\n\nIt  means extensions lose some capabilities, notably the ability to act after the websitse server has answered the requests the browser made. Extensions need to say beforehand what they'll block, which means they need to know in advance what constitutes an ad or a tracker, and what isn't, when before, they could react in real time as the website called to various resources.\n\nhttps://blog.chromium.org/2019/06/web-request-and-declarative-net-request.html\n\nAnd that's where the problem is: this new API severely limits what browser extensions can do, and will make all ad blockers and privacy focused extensions a lot less useful.\n\nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening\n\nThis spec specifically destroys the capabilities of everything that currently hurts Google's business model.\n\nChrome and the chromium engine control the whole web. Chromium based browsers are about 85% of all desktop browsers. Globally, it's about 63% if we count mobile.\n\nThis means that extension developers, if they want their extension to reach users, HAVE to develop it for Chrome and chrome based browsers.\n\nFirefox is compatible with Chrome extensions, mostly, and developers generally don't have a ton of work to do to ensure that their extension runs on it as well. But with manifest v3, developers will have to maintain 2 versions of their extensions. One that runs on Chrome and chromium based browsers, and one that runs on Firefox.\n\nWhy would you do some extra work to maintain your extension for a browser that has very little market share worldwide?", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["google", "meta", "ad business"], "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2022-09-18T18:17:04+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "https://www.economist.com/business/2022/09/18/the-300bn-google-meta-advertising-duopoly-is-under-attack", "language": "en-US", "age": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": true, "artist": null, "source_obj__id": 28, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "The $300B Google-Meta advertising duopoly is under attack", "thumbnail": null, "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2022/09/18/the-300bn-google-meta-advertising-duopoly-is-under-attack\">https://www.economist.com/business/2022/09/18/the-300bn-google-meta-advertising-duopoly-is-under-attack</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32889929\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32889929</a></p>\n<p>Points: 70</p>\n<p># Comments: 39</p>", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["privacy", "surveillance", "big tech", "corporatocracy", "technofeudalism", "tiktok"], "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2022-09-18T10:28:53+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy-us?lang=en", "language": "en-US", "age": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": true, "artist": null, "source_obj__id": 28, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "TikTok privacy policy says they monitor names of other installed apps", "thumbnail": null, "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy-us?lang=en\">https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy-us?lang=en</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32886241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32886241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 44</p>\n<p># Comments: 23</p>", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": [], "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2022-09-18T08:14:57+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "https://www.dailywire.com/news/school-district-defends-trans-shop-teacher-whose-enormous-fake-breasts-spurred-internet-furor", "language": "en-US", "age": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": true, "artist": null, "source_obj__id": 52, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://www.dailywire.com/feeds/rss.xml", "title": "School District Defends Trans Shop Teacher Whose Enormous Fake Breasts Spurred Internet Furor", "thumbnail": null, "description": "A Canadian school district is standing behind a biologically male teacher whose wearing of massive prosthetic breasts created an online furor, according to a new report.

One that is not only basically believed by the whole world, but one that is running our nations, and being bought and paid for by your tax dollars.\n\nYou've definitely heard of \"Net Zero\" before. It was first popularised during the Paris Climate Agreement in 2016, hosted by the United Nations. And while they likely have the best interests of our planet at heart, there are of course massive entities (especially the world's oil companies) who are taking advantage of Net Zero. Mostly, so they can make lots and lots of money.\n\nThe worst thing is, one of the solutions being heralded as our best choice for achieving these goals is carbon capture and storage. Which isn't basically doing anything at all. And is being use to make billions in extra dollars for oil companies.\n\nLet me know your thoughts below.\n\n0:00 - Why Net Zero\n1:02 - Where \"Net Zero\" actually came for\n2:16 - How oil companies lie about Net Zero\n3:38 - Carbon capture isn't what we were promised\n6:38 - Why oil companies really like CCS technology\n8:28 - Net Zero is just misdirection\n10:23 - Some final thoughts\n\n\u25ba IMPORTANT LINKS:\nEnter your email below for free weekly lessons and insights into becoming financially free, investing, global tax and corporate structures, passports, residencies, and more.\n\nhttps://www.abundantia.co/\n\n\u25ba SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u2022 Abundantia Instagram: @abundantia.co https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/\n\u2022 Sorelle's Instagram: @sorelleamore  https://instagram.com/sorelleamore\n\u2022 Leon's Instagram: @leonhill  https://instagram.com/leonhill\n\u2022 Abundantia Twitter: https://twitter.com/abundantiaco\n\u2022 Abundantia Facebook: http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance\n\nSorelle and Leon.\nFounders, Abundantia\n\nLiability Disclaimer: https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer\n*We may earn a commission if you buy any products or services via the links in this video's description.

This is how it's done. Support independent research and analysis by joining my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone \n\nThe Internet is a giant network of privately owned spaces open to public, where every participant knows the exact identity and location of one another and where corporate stalking is a perfectly legitimate business model. If you are not okay with automated decisions being made about your every move, you should consider creating an anonymous identity.\n\nAnonymity is the most powerful mitigation strategy on a publicly observable network such as the Internet. It is the most direct path towards privacy. This guide will tell you exactly what you need to know and do in order to create and maintain your very own anonymous identity. \n\nThe Internet is a privacy nightmare because every action is by default identifiable and linkable. That means actions always lead to a unique location and/or account on the network and actions can built a profile over time. Linkability and identifiability are your biggest privacy and anonymity threats on the Internet. For maximum anonymity, both of these threats need to be mitigated to the fullest extent possible. \n\nOur first step with any service will be to dissociate our account details from our personal information. The second step is to compartmentalize our anonymous identities so that they are isolated from our personal identities.\n\nDissociation and isolation of your anonymous identities are not the only steps to keep your anonymity. Be extremely cautious of what types of data you submit to these services while using them. Always think of the linkability and identifiability threats when using these accounts. \n\nPRIVACY THREAT MODELING\nhttps://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/ \nLINDDUN strategy for threat modeling\nhttps://www.linddun.org/post/keys-to-successful-privacy-threat-modeling\nhttps://www.linddun.org/linddun \nhttps://www.linddun.org/_files/ugd/cc602e_cf7e4c6b1d894bdaabc3094c48b26869.pdf \nhttps://www.linddun.org/go-getting-started \nLinkability\nhttps://www.linddun.org/linkability \nIdentifiability\nhttps://www.linddun.org/identifiability-1 \nMitigation strategies\nhttps://www.linddun.org/mitigation-strategies-and-solutions \n\nRECOMMENDED TOOLS\nKeepassXC\nhttps://keepassxc.org/ \nBitwarden\nhttps://bitwarden.com/ \nFIDO security keys\nhttps://fidoalliance.org/what-is-fido/ \nGrapheneOS\nhttps://grapheneos.org/\nOrbot\nhttps://orbot.app/ \nTor Browser\nhttps://www.torproject.org/ \nTutanota\nhttps://tutanota.com/ \nProtonMail\nhttps://proton.me/ \nBriar\nhttps://briarproject.org/\nOnionShare\nhttps://onionshare.org/\nWire\nhttps://wire.com/en/\nMatrix/Element\nhttps://element.io/\nHow to anonymously install applications\nhttps://www.privacyguides.org/android/#obtaining-applications \nAurora Open Source Software\nhttps://auroraoss.com/\nHow to obtain an anonymous burner phone - The Intercept\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4gqRYkA9KE \nHow to obtain an anonymous burner phone - The Hated One\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMJH-UJyENs\n\nNEWS SOURCES\nGoogle location tracking\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/states-file-new-suits-against-google-over-location-tracking-11643037890 \nChainalysis\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/04/chainalysis-estimates-2b-stolen-from-cross-chain-bridge-hacks-this-year/ \n\nCredits\nMusic by: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcavSftXHgxLBWwLDm_bNvA\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": [], "user": "Thomas Pain", "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2022-08-13T10:18:22.913665+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/starlink-internet-dish-hack/", "language": "en-US", "age": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": true, "artist": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://www.wired.com", "title": "The Hacking of Starlink Terminals Has Begun | WIRED", "thumbnail": null, "description": "It cost a researcher only $25 worth of parts to create a tool that allows custom code to run on the satellite dishes.", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": [], "user": "Thomas Pain", "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2022-08-13T09:47:01+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "https://www.fiod.nl/arrest-of-suspected-developer-of-tornado-cash/", "language": "en", "age": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": true, "artist": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://www.fiod.nl", "title": "Arrest of suspected developer of Tornado Cash - FIOD", "thumbnail": null, "description": "On Wednesday 10 August, the FIOD arrested a 29-year-old man in Amsterdam.

His stated goals were two-fold: Firstly, to rid the social media network of bots and other fake accounts. Secondly, to ensure Twitter was doing all it could to protect \u201cfree speech\u201d on its service.\n\nOver the past six months, Musk has joined the legions of activists on the political right who bemoan what they see as an overly-stringent approach to content moderation (or what they usually describe as \u201ccensorship\") on Twitter. They claim that this is stifling public discourse and taking away users\u2019 rights to freedom of speech and expression.\n\nBut what would a Muskian Twitter actually have looked like? Could he have seen-through his plans for securing \u201cfree speech\u201d on the platform? Or is it all a little bit more complicated than that.\n\nJoin me as we take a dive into the ways in which discussions around freedom of speech tend to fail, the history of the so-called \u201cmarketplace of ideas\u201d and what all of this might mean for how we look back on the attempt by Elon Musk to buy Twitter.\n\nSupport the channel on Patreon at http://patreon.com/tomnicholas\n\nIf you've enjoyed this video and would like to see more including my What The Theory? series in which I provide some snappy introductions to key theories in the humanities as well as video essays and more then do consider subscribing.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/tom_nicholas\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/tomnicholaswtf\nPatreon: http://patreon.com/tomnicholas\nWebsite: http://www.tomnicholas.com\n\nSelect footage courtesy of Getty\n\n#ElonMusk #Twitter #FreeSpeech", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["sri lanka", "crisis"], "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2022-07-29T14:09:02+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-29/sri-lanka-inflation-climbs-to-60-8-as-dollar-crunch-persists", "language": "en", "age": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": true, "artist": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://www.bloomberg.com", "title": "Sri Lanka Inflation Rises to 60.8% as Dollar Crunch Persists", "thumbnail": null, "description": "Sri Lanka Inflation Rises to 60.8% as Dollar Crunch Persists", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["religion knowledge", "christianity", "religion"], "user": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2022-07-29T11:53:20+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/christianity-based-paganism/", "language": "en-US", "age": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": true, "artist": null, "source_obj__id": 18, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml", "title": "'Based' Paganism vs. Christianity", "thumbnail": null, "description": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write about Paganism recently. I will frame it as a response to an email I received within the past day or so:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hey Luke,</p>\n<p>First off, I would like to thank you for all your efforts in making everything\nyou know accessible to everyone. You have exposed me to some of the most\nthought-provoking people on the internet and Varg is one of them. I was\nwondering if you can write an article or make a video on what you think about\nVarg&rsquo;s Paganism in relation to you choosing Orthodox Christianity. I know that\nyou briefly talked about it in one of your livestreams, however, I would like\nto better understand why you don&rsquo;t practice Paganism yourself. My background is\nSerbian and most Serbians follow the Serbian Orthodox Church, but after\nwatching Varg&rsquo;s videos, I&rsquo;m conflicted. I agree with a lot of what Varg says\nabout Christianity, but my father long ago told me to follow the Serbian\nOrthodox Church if I were to become religious. I&rsquo;m sure that many people feel\nthe same way after watching Varg&rsquo;s videos, and your thoughts on it would\ngreatly help people like me make up their minds.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p><em>redacted</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I will sum up my answer to this email in bullet points, then explain what I mean.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modern &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; is not a real thing and has nothing to do with paganism in history.</li>\n<li>The most direct cultural link between modern man and antiquity is the orthodox Christian Church.</li>\n<li>Truth matters&mdash;&ldquo;Picking&rdquo; a religion on personal preferences is brain-dead and self-refuting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"your-average-pagan\">Your Average Pagan</h2>\n<p>Many people probably don&rsquo;t know who Varg Vikernes is, but since the email brings him up, I will talk about him as an example of where paganism leads.\nModern &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; is not an authentic tradition handed down over the ages.\nIt is an attempt of modern disconnected people to recreate or re-engineer a culture, time and place they have absolutely no contact with.\nThis ultimately makes &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; a modernist Rorschach test where individuals can more-or-less create the religion they want.</p>\n<h3 id=\"paganism-with-modern-goggles\">Paganism with modern goggles</h3>\n<p>Varg&rsquo;s particular &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; is a kind of scientific euhemerism: he doesn&rsquo;t actually believe in gods in the way an ancient pagan would have, but that the concepts of the gods represent scientific or other knowledge.\n(This is where the placenta meme around him comes from after all, when he and his wife related assorted pagan myths and items to the tree-like appearance of a human placenta.)\nHe has also reduced classical abstract spiritual concepts into hormones and other related things.\nIn essence, he has created a pseudo-paganism that is compatible with modern materialism.</p>\n<p>Varg had cited and recommended works such as Frazer&rsquo;s <em>Golden Bough</em> as influential on his thought which is of a similar vein.\nThis book was part of a wider movement in the English-speaking rationalist world to rationalize and explain myth.\nIt goes without saying that I think this all comes from the assumption of modern man that all ancient people underlyingly thought like Neil deGrasse Tyson.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-long-until-legend-becomes-myth\">How long until legend becomes myth?</h3>\n<p>More plausible is the viewpoint I&rsquo;ve spoken of in works such as <a href=\"https://notrelated.xyz/#02.04\"><em>Hamlet&rsquo;s Mill</em></a>.\nIt alleges that <em>one specific</em> prehistoric civilization used myth to transmit scientific knowledge, but being thousands of years out from that civilization, the descendant stories are distorted, partial and can only be related after extensive study.\nThey allege that &ldquo;Hamlet stories&rdquo; are similar in origin and actually carry astrological information, including the idea of the procession of the equinoxes.</p>\n<p>But Varg&rsquo;s quasi-euhemerism makes a much stronger claim, that all our &ldquo;forebears&rdquo; (as he tends to call them) left an entire encyclopedia of scientific knowledge in stories that have remained unblemished and mostly unchanged over thousands or <em>millions</em> of years since the Neanderthals, who he views as the Trve Europeans.</p>\n<p>This stronger claim should be absurd on its face, as it assumes that over the millennia, there is little to no addition, subtraction or change of folklore.\nThe <em>Hamlet&rsquo;s Mill</em> model admits that this does happen, but Varg is dealing with a much longer scale and often makes very specific claims about some myths.\nWhat I think Varg is truly doing when he looks at a pagan myth and sees a placenta, he is seeing statistical noise and fitting that noise to the many possibilities in his head.\n(I will also say that this is somewhat the modus operandi of many capital-T &ldquo;Traditionalists&rdquo; in the vein of Evola or Gu\u00e9non.)</p>\n<aside>\nThis is principally a response to the theories that Varg put forth around 2016-2018 when I would occasionally watch his videos. I'm sure it's very possible that he endorses things very different now, since this \"paganism\" is not anything concrete.\n</aside>\n<h2 id=\"is-christianity-a-departure-from-european-tradition\">Is Christianity a departure from European tradition?</h2>\n<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve tried to emphasize <a href=\"https://notrelated.xyz/#02.02\">in some places</a> is the general wrongness of the idea of the cultural &ldquo;quantum leap&rdquo; or &ldquo;discontinuity&rdquo; between Prechristian and Christian Europe.\nThis is a highly important issue for many putative pagans, because they view the &ldquo;change&rdquo; of Europe over to Christianity as perhaps the start of the now constant and perpetual leftist cultural revolution.</p>\n<p>This is the idea, which most people and &ldquo;based&rdquo; pagans have even by osmosis, that the Christianization of Europe was a radical break from history and tradition.</p>\n<p>This is true only on the Christian metric: obviously the salvation of Europe is a quantum leap.\nHowever, melodramatic pagans will lament that this is when Europe have up its &ldquo;European&rdquo; soul and adopted a &ldquo;Jewish&rdquo; or &ldquo;desert&rdquo; religion which put the continent on a totally different and out-of-touch cultural direction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pagan-philosophy-and-christianity\">Pagan Philosophy and Christianity</h3>\n<p>Christian theology, including Trinitarian theology has direct and undeniable &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; analogues and imitators:\nNeoplatonism expresses a kind of theological trinity as well (the One, the Intellect and the Soul), albeit one more similar to Origen&rsquo;s trinity where a hierarchy of the three persons exist.</p>\n<p>In the cosmogony of the <em>Poemandres</em>, a Hermetic work, shows a pagan creation myth wherein God creates the world via his <em>Logos</em>, as in the first chapter of St. John&rsquo;s gospel, which also has a trinitarian and monotheistic unity with God (differing from Christianity in its panentheism).</p>\n<p>As I mentioned in the linked podcast <a href=\"https://notrelated.xyz/#02.02\">episode above</a>, Stoic philosophy is a component needed to understand the opening of the gospel of John and is part of the philosophical backdrop of early Christian theology.</p>\n<p>Medieval esoteric doctrines and alchemy viewed all of nature as trinitarian, possessing body, mind, and spirit (salt, sulfur and mercury), which was related directly to the Triune nature of God.\nEven specific mystical sects like Mithraism or the many forms of Gnosticism are tied closely to the development of Christianity.</p>\n<p>All of these intellectual strands were intertwined with Christianity since the beginning of the written expression of Christian theology.</p>\n<p>A pagan now has to ask himself: if Hermeticism or Mithraism had taken over as a universal religion of Europe, would they loathe it like they loathe Christianity and view it as a radical departure from &ldquo;paganism?&rdquo;\nNote that Hermeticism had an alleged Egyptian origin, and Mithraism had a orientalist/Iranic origin.</p>\n<p>Note that none of my point here is specifically that Christianity influenced or created these other philosophies or that they influenced (providentially) Christianity.\nWhat is important is that looking at it dispassionately, we cannot deem Christianity as some cultural departure from &ldquo;real&rdquo; European culture without also throwing out this entire philosophical tradition as a whole.</p>\n<p>Medieval Christians would often look at Greek Philosophy as another covenant of God established to prepare mankind intellectually for the revelation of the Trinity.\n(Note also that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCjX0il3wkc\">Dante and others</a> represent Christians who viewed the Roman Empire also as part of a divine plan.)</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the Christian religion is non-cultural and thus universal/catholic. There are cultural aspects associated with it, but there&rsquo;s a difference between essence and accidents.\nOf those cultural aspects, they are nearly all European, not, as some allege, Hebrew or Jewish.\nMost of the New Testament is quite literally an explication of why this religion which accepts the Hebrew Scriptures is markedly non-Jewish and why Jewish practices like circumcision and sacrifice are sacrilegious.</p>\n<p>So the view we should get from this is that Christianization was no cultural leap into an alien worldview, but something whose intellectual side happened slowly over centuries and would only be viewed as spiritual, not culturally distinct from its environment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"which-change-is-good\">Which change is good?</h3>\n<p>Note that even Varg admits that religious interpretation and practice changes with the centuries.\nIn his interpretation and even in his RPG, MYFAROG (which is really just an expression of his paganism and worldview), characters can have one of two &ldquo;Life Stances&rdquo; or religious inclinations: <em>Sei\u00f0r</em> or  <em>\u00c2satr\u00fb</em>.\nSei\u00f0r &ldquo;tradition,&rdquo; represents a kind of animism, witchcraft or spell-casting, while \u00c2satr\u00fb represents the worship of pagan gods.\nCharacters can choose either life stance, but one can only change from Sei\u00f0r to \u00c2satr\u00fb, which is a representation of the alleged historical shift in early history from animistic to polytheistic practices.</p>\n<p>If we accept this cultural transition as &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; in terms of cultural continuity, on what grounds could we also mark as verboten a shift from polytheism to monotheism?\nAfter all, the pagan philosophy of Plato and Aristotle even from the earliest was monotheistic at its core, and even today, the world&rsquo;s one remaining &ldquo;polytheistic&rdquo; religion, Hinduism only appears so on the surface, but has at its core its own monad and final cause: Brahman.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tradition-vs-inventing-your-own-religion\">Tradition vs. Inventing your own religion</h2>\n<p>To learn of Christian theology, thus, is to set oneself down a road of millennia of learning with often with no delineation between Christian and Prechristian thought.\nBy the same token, learning of secular philosophy, even as an atheist might lead you to Christianity, as was the case with me.\nThere is no obvious discontinuity, either in thought or practice.</p>\n<p>But modern day &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; does indeed have such a gap.\nTo be a &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; does not involve communing with a centuries-old tradition passed down generation-to-generation from antiquity.</p>\n<p>It is modern people imagining based on T.V. shows, books and their own creativity what Prechristian Europe was like and then putting on their own imitation of it.\nThey might see something they dislike in the world, blame it on Christians and then imagine a world without it.\nThis invariably comes with retrojecting their own modern values and assumptions on the past.</p>\n<p>After all, we Christians can sit down with an Orthodox Priest or grow up in a Orthodox household and have a direct, personal contact with a tradition and understand how people who are part of it think and act.\nWe have no tangible contact with Prechristian European paganism, even out of intellectual interest.\nUnderstanding how Europeans truly thought and acted is an issue of cultural reconstruction and theory.\nTraditional folklore and practices are still very much alive, but they are now decked in a Christian garb.\nWe do celebrate Christmas for Our Lord&rsquo;s birth, but everyone knows that nearly all of the practices of that season of the many nations of Europe predate Christianization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-worst-possible-decision\">The Worst Possible Decision.</h3>\n<p>All this said, the absolute worst self-own possible would be someone who has direct and easy access to the Orthodox Church and abandons it or leaves it for a false &ldquo;religion&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t even exist off of the internet and has no organic connection to reality, like Neo-Paganism.</p>\n<p>So my recommendation to the emailer above should be obvious.</p>\n<p>Being physically close to the Orthodox Church is a huge asset, but even being able to travel to one occasionally is a massive grace. Everyone should be taking advantage of that as often as possible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pagan-gurus\">Pagan Gurus</h3>\n<p>Because it is ungrounded and ahistorical, modern &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; thus naturally exists as a kind of extreme Protestant guru-centered feel-goodery where since there is absolutely no tether to a genuine preserved tradition, a man can make up an unfalsifiable claim about what true &ldquo;Paganism&rdquo; is and sell it as legit.</p>\n<p>I mentioned Varg earlier, who has concocted a &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; that consists in claiming that their lore and practice embed scientific information.\nHe doesn&rsquo;t <em>believe</em> in pagan gods, unless we&rsquo;re talking about belief in a very evasive and meaningless Jordan Peterson kind of way.\nIf we could actually transport a prehistoric pagan to our day and speak to him, he would probably either be confused or bemused by this very modern worldview, but we can&rsquo;t even do this.</p>\n<p>Most pagans are not &ldquo;based&rdquo; like Varg anyway (he lives a minimalist and traditional lifestyle in rural France with an ever-growing family).\nMost &ldquo;pagans&rdquo; are leftists who like &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; because they hate God and nature and morality and imagine that pagans were demented sexual perverts like they are.</p>\n<h2 id=\"truth\">Truth</h2>\n<p>Notice that I had specifically avoided the most important issue: Truth.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve done this because when people are asking to convert to something just because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;based,&rdquo; <em>Truth</em> is unfortunately not necessarily their concern, so I&rsquo;ve first addressed issues that do concern them.</p>\n<p>The reality is, thankfully, that truth is the most &ldquo;based&rdquo; thing of all&mdash;And it is entirely cringe to believe in something because it sounds cool to you.\nIf you think you can decide your own truth, you are no different from someone who thinks they can decide their own pronouns, literally.</p>\n<p>Even in the email above, he refers to me &ldquo;choosing&rdquo; orthodox Christianity as if it were an issue of personal taste.\nIf I liked pop music and people rolling on the ground, perhaps I would be just as justified converting to some Pentecostal sect.\nThis is silly.</p>\n<p>The greatest deception is that religion is this separate category about &ldquo;feelings&rdquo; or &ldquo;preference&rdquo; and not truth.\nAtheist and spiritual R*dditor Stephen Jay Gould put this in words in the modern era, calling science and religion &ldquo;non-overlapping magesteria,&rdquo; declaring in a laughable attempt at big-braned centrism that nothing in material reality is relevant to religion and nothing in religion is relevant to material reality.</p>\n<p>This is strange because people can research the philosophies I mentioned earlier, Platonism, Gnosticism, Stoicism, Hermeticism and can analyze and critique them and look at them as models of reality perfectly comparable to modern philosophical assumptions and approaches.\nBut we have been taught to view Christianity as this separate category, that can&rsquo;t possibly be a model of reality, but is a something merely &ldquo;moral&rdquo; or &ldquo;personal&rdquo; or &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; which are all terms that have been debased to mean nothing at all.</p>\n<p>A Christian believes that Jesus&rsquo;s resurrection was a true historical event, and a prelude of a general resurrection to come and that he established a Church and sacraments which are his vehicles for having man recover from sin within this life to prepare for his roles in the next.\nThe orthodox Christian Church is an unbroken chain since that period, and oft built on yet older philosophical and liturgical practices.</p>\n<p>If you find this alien or God unbelieveable, you can do yourself the favor of prayer and visit a priest and see what happens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"they-dont-even-believe-it\">They don&rsquo;t even believe it.</h3>\n<p>To contrast, pagans do not believe in pagan gods. Their brains are 100% modern and materialistic in mindset, and if they ironically say they believe in gods, it is out of some kind of Petersonian fake metaphorical &ldquo;belief&rdquo; in a concept or that &ldquo;Zeus&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a person, but is some kind of abstraction symbolizing the weather or something silly.\nThe only thing sillier is for them to claim that people in the ancient world <em>didn&rsquo;t really believe in them either</em>, but practiced entire religions meta-ironically for some social reasons.\nIf they believe in a &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; nature, it is not one beyond or above matter, but instead derived from it: it is psychological, hormonal, etc.</p>\n<p>Modern paganism is neither a tradition, nor a religion, nor even a belief.\nIt is just a new identity which supposedly flexes some kind of disposition to the world which is not even consistent across pagans because there is no basis for any of it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"real-baste-european-pagans\">Real Baste European Pagans</h3>\n<p>Christians, however, do believe in pagan gods.\nChristians have always admitted the reality of spiritual beings, including the demonic.\nYou can take the Michael Heiser/Divine Council pill on this if you&rsquo;re interested:\nWhile there is only one Creator and Supreme God, he created many among his heavenly host, and originally appointed them to the different races on earth.\nMany rebelled and set themselves up as specific gods of their appointed races.</p>\n<p>One of the purposes of Christ&rsquo;s coming was to vanquish these usurpers, and thus paganism/polytheism, which obviously has been successful.\n(Note that the <a href=\"https://lindypress.net/book?pk=6\">Book of Enoch</a> in Chapter 10 prophecies that these fallen angels would be judged 70 generations after the Enochian period, which cross-referencing with the Gospel of Luke, it is exactly 70 generations until Christ.)\nNow the issues of faith are not so much polytheism, but heresy and then atheism, which is a significant enough change in the cosmic dynamic.</p>", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": [], "user": "Thomas Pain", "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2022-07-29T11:13:47.193167+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-62335147", "language": "en-GB", "age": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": true, "artist": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://www.bbc.com", "title": "Bristol Drag queen children's story hour disrupted by protests - BBC News", "thumbnail": null, "description": "A demonstration against a drag queen story reading for children causes the Bristol event to be postponed.", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["palladium", "secure boot", "tpm", "web environment integrity", "microsoft", "pluton"], "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2022-07-29T07:21:23+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 90.0, "link": "https://gabrielsieben.tech/2022/07/29/remote-assertion-is-coming-back-how-much-freedom-will-it-take/", "language": "en-US", "age": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": true, "artist": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://gabrielsieben.tech", "title": "Remote attestation is coming back.

Now that my body is broken I can start enjoying life!&rdquo;</li>\n<li><em>*Dies of seed-oil-induced heart attack.*</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It&rsquo;d be wrong to singularly blame student loans for all of this, but there is a tangible sense in which opening up any new massive monthly liability to the system encourages people to open up more to cover for it.</p>\n<p>No one is ever told that this is the inevitable end of increasing liabilities: you need more and more liabilities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"which-way-millennial\">&ldquo;Which way Millennial?&rdquo;</h3>\n<p>Millennials come in two financial categories: around 90% of them are extreme consoomers who cannot not spend every penny of their salaries on subscriptions, plastic toys and coffee and seem to view the fact they get calls from collections agencies as some unpreventable outcome of &ldquo;capitalism.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The other 10% are the exact opposite: they are contemplating living in the trunk of their 1990&rsquo;s Corolla parked in the parking lot of their job site so they can save 97% of their income.\nWhen they plan on buying a house or getting married, they are quixotically salivating on how much money they can save on monthly bills.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-endgame\">The Endgame</h2>\n<p>I will go ahead and say, I consider the ideal not even to be rich, but to not need money to live a comfortable life because you have put yourself in a geographic and behavioral position where you can survive on as little as possible.</p>\n<p>Either way, my mindset (as the second type of millennial) has always been &ldquo;How can I absolutely minimize the amount of money I need to live?&rdquo;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&ldquo;What is the cheapest place to rent?&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;What is the cheapest-per-calorie real food for me to eat?&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;What &ldquo;needs&rdquo; are not really needs and can I go without?&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The implicit goal was to live on as little as possible: that&rsquo;s what actually maximizes your life&rsquo;s freedom.\nIf you can live on less than, say, $500 a month, even working as a part-time wagie, you will be plenty to pay bills, save a significant amount and have lots of free time.</p>\n<p>For young single guys in computer science, this is especially ideal, since your hobbey/craft doesn&rsquo;t cost anything to tinker with.</p>\n<p>In my late twenties, right before I bought my house, I was living in a college town with a monthly budget <strong>including my rent</strong> of around $400 ($300 was rent $100 was basically groceries). Probably went over that $100 most months, but never by much. This is also when I started <a href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/making-free-money-off-credit-cards\">churning credit cards</a> to make a significant portion of my little expenditure back.</p>\n<h2 id=\"behavioral-patterns-over-life\">Behavioral Patterns over Life</h2>\n<p>As you&rsquo;re saving money to buy/pay off a permanent dwelling place, most important is cultivating permanent behaviors that will reduce your need for money and &ldquo;the system.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>If you take the &ldquo;high&rdquo;-income, high-liability route, you&rsquo;re going to be establishing wasteful antipatterns your early life and when you need to buckle down and root those out, it will be more difficult because it will be the egotistically trying task of going from showly and &ldquo;easy&rdquo; pleasure spending to a Spartan budget.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to have a solid foundation of low spending. I said in that video years ago on getting Trumpbux that all money you earn and spend should be directly weaponized to decrease your reliance on money. Property, tools, plants, skills. These are investments much more substantial than investing in boomer stocks because they lessen your need for money.</p>\n<h3 id=\"worst-case-scenario\">Worst Case Scenario</h3>\n<p>As a passing remark, I&rsquo;ll add that the other benefit of focusing on minimizing liabilities is that it makes you significantly less reliant on &ldquo;the system&rdquo; and more robust in the case of disaster.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Training&rdquo; to get a highly specific corporate job is not going to help you in all possible scenarios in the way that simple the simple craftsmanship of someone who fixes their own cars and things.</p>", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": [], "user": "Thomas Pain", "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2022-07-16T09:12:52.097611+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2022/how-i-went-about-learning-rust/", "language": ">long time now</a>,\nand about a year ago I finally began allocating some time every week to learning\nit.</p>\n<p>In this post I'll provide details on the learning path I've followed for Rust,\nin the hope that this may prove useful for others.

the sheer absurdity that while the suitcase and other bags had existed for lifetimes, it was only in the 1990&rsquo;s that people had the idea to put wheels on the things so they didn&rsquo;t have to haul them around airports all day with their strength.</p>\n<p>It reminds you of the fact that while children in the Incan Empire did indeed have some toys with wheels, apparently no one thought to use the wheel to make a simple cart or wagon to use in town or on the Inca&rsquo;s extensive imperial roadways.</p>\n<p>The proper response to hearing this should be the deserved angst that right now, there are make &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; technological improvements we could make to improve our lives significantly.\nEven worse, in lieu of these simple and obvious solutions which have lain hidden in plain site for centuries, we have no doubt developed a lot of inefficient technology to fill in the gap.</p>\n<p>Since I was recently doing <a href=\"https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/w/oz4VV8SrnTEACCndxMASZH\">tutorials on Hugo</a>, a static site generator, it&rsquo;s funny to think that through the 90&rsquo;s, no one really thought to invent a computationally simple static-site generator as they exist now.\nPeople moved pretty much directly from manually edditing HTML files manually into massive proprietary WYSIWYG editors and web &ldquo;frameworks&rdquo; that regenerate web pages on every single visit.</p>\n<p>This lack of vision and inability to see the simpler solution has largely produced the slow-loading, content-minimal web of today and the bizarre culture of modern &ldquo;webdevs&rdquo; whose diets consist in anti-patterns.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-shame-of-bitcoin\">The shame of Bitcoin</h2>\n<p>Recently there was <a href=\"https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/w/7PZGdoF7WdpWVS1UDcwDFz\">an interview released of me</a> at Monerotopia with the Crypto Vigilate team.\nUnfortunately, the video cut off and doesn&rsquo;t have perhaps the best part which I now remember: our discussion on the possibility of &ldquo;obvious solutions&rdquo; that could conceivably replace proof-of-work in cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin, ultimately is a self-reinforcing behavioral Nash Equilibrium that uses the logic of proof-of-work mining to establish consensus while still remaining decentralized.\nThe thing is, anyone who is not a delusional fanboy has to look at proof-of-work as some kind of incredible weird and inefficient abomination.</p>\n<p>To establish decentralized consensus, we have to have an increasing farm of the world&rsquo;s computers performing computations that do essentially nothing outside of &ldquo;secure the network.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>There is no magic force in the universe that has ordained that the only possible way to establish decentralized consensus is Proof-of-Work.\nProof-of-stake is obviously an alternative to it, but one whose long-term game theoretic nature is still an issue of significant controversy.</p>\n<p>Regardless, an alien civilization observing us might view the issue of decentralized consensus similar to how we view the Inca who never thought to use wheels to make carts.\nIt will be pretty absurd if most of the world&rsquo;s computing power will soon be dedicated to proof-of-work mining only for some bratty kid or jaded cryptographer to come up with an &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; other way to establish a self-reinforcing system that can verify decentralized consensus that doesn&rsquo;t require the waste.</p>\n<h2 id=\"take-aways\">Take-aways</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Technological opportunities are not just everywhere, they are right in front of your face.</li>\n<li>The fact that a solution is obvious and simple is not reason for ruling it out because &ldquo;Someone must have thought of that and tried it before.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>Never be happy with technology that is inelegant just because there is no obvious alternative now.</li>\n</ol>", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["wechat", "china", "big tech", "surveillance", "privacy", "everything app", "big brother"], "user": "rumpel",

The unconscious perception of marriage as an institution is something akin to \u201clegally-sanctioned boyfriend and girlfriend,\u201d an arrangement that lasts as long as both are \u201chappy.\u201d Under this view, augmenting personal happiness is the core function of marriage. When it ceases to provide sufficient novelty and enjoyment, it is jettisoned. (Often this leads to blowing up an established family, ejecting the other party from the home, and collecting cash &amp; prizes from them under implicit threat of violence from the state. <a href=\"https://raypatrick.xyz/blog/2022/05/01/there-are-no-good-people\">All people are sinful</a> and would likely do such things if properly tempted, but in our current legal climate this is overwhelmingly done by women.) Marriage is seen as some kind of bucket-list item rather than a serious institution meant to create a family. Something ordained by God has become transformed into nothing more than a vendible commodity, to be enjoyed for a brief time if desired and then disposed of. What an unspeakable tragedy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"redefining-words\">Redefining Words</h3>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"John 18:38: Pilate mocks Christ and the concept of objective truth, asking \u201cQuid est veritas?\u201d (\u201cWhat is truth?\u201d) - Painting by Jan Van\u2019t Hoff\" src=\"https://raypatrick.xyz/blog/2022/06/03/marriage-is-not-to-make-you-happy/pilate.jpg\" /><figcaption>John 18:38: Pilate mocks Christ and the concept of objective truth, asking \u201cQuid est veritas?\u201d (\u201cWhat is truth?\u201d) - Painting by <a href=\"https://www.gospelimages.com/theartist\">Jan Van\u2019t Hoff</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Redefining words can be a theological statement. (Actually, it can be arguably claimed that <a href=\"https://adam4d.com/theologic/\">every statement is theological.</a>) People used to ask why Christians were so upset about same-sex marriage when \u201cit wasn\u2019t hurting anybody.\u201d The answer is that it was a sad reminder that our culture is changing the definition of marriage from \u201cman and wife\u201d to \u201ca pair of (currently) willing adults,\u201d which is not what marriage is. In forcing us to deny the truth, they may as well force us to deny Christ; the reason we worship Christ in the first place is because he\u2019s the True God, not because he\u2019s the \u201cUseful God.\u201d</p>\n<p>Similarly, that our government equates \u201cfather\u201d with \u201ccurrent boyfriend\u201d in terms of taxes, child support, etc. is yet another assault on the truth. What is seemingly a question of semantics is actually the conceit that objective, universal truth does not exist and \u201cmorality\u201d is simply whatever we can get away with.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-marriage\">What is Marriage?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"english-law\">English Law</h3>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to be an Anglican to appreciate the impact that the 1662 Book of Common Prayer has had on English-speaking Christians for the last 400-ish years. Of course your tastes may be different, but I <a href=\"https://raypatrick.xyz/blog/2022/02/26/the-venerable-king-james-version\">have always appreciated</a> Early Modern English prose and verse.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I bring this up because I think it\u2019s possible that the divines who lived at that time, imperfect yet not blinded by the spirit of our age, may have something to teach us about marriage. Allow me to quote from the Form of Solemnization of Matrimony:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DEARLY beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God, and in the face of this Congregation, to join together this man and this woman in holy Matrimony; which is an honourable estate, instituted of God in the time of man\u2019s innocency, signifying unto us the mystical union that is betwixt Christ and his Church; which holy estate Christ adorned and beautified with his presence, and first miracle that he wrought, in Cana of Galilee; and is commended of Saint Paul to be honourable among all men: and therefore is <strong>not by any to be enterprised, nor taken in hand, unadvisedly, lightly, or wantonly, to satisfy men\u2019s carnal lusts and appetites, like brute beasts that have no understanding; but reverently, discreetly, advisedly, soberly, and in the fear of God; duly considering the causes for which Matrimony was ordained.</strong></p>\n<p>First, It was ordained for the procreation of children, to be brought up in the fear and nurture of the Lord, and to the praise of his holy Name.</p>\n<p>Secondly, It was ordained for a remedy against sin, and to avoid fornication; that such persons as have not the gift of continency might marry, and keep themselves undefiled members of Christ\u2019s body.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, It was ordained for the mutual society, help, and comfort, that the one ought to have of the other, both in prosperity and adversity.</p>\n<p>Into which holy estate these two persons present come now to be joined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In summary, the BCP says that marriage is ordained:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>As a prefiguring or image of Christ\u2019s mystical union with his Church.</li>\n<li>For the procreation of children and to teach them the things of God.</li>\n<li>To create a safe harbor against the world and sin.</li>\n<li>For mutual help and comfort in prosperity and in adversity.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>and further, it is not to be taken in hand unadvisedly, lightly, or wantonly or to satisfy carnal desire. This sounds a lot different than what you see in popular culture. Conspicuously, I find no reference to unmodified \u201chappiness.\u201d</p>\n<h3 id=\"joyless-puritans\">Joyless Puritans?</h3>\n<p>So is marriage some kind of cold business-type relationship? Hardly. If you aim at the true goals for marriage (start a loving family, create a safe harbor against the world and sin, help and comfort each other throughout life), you\u2019ll find that real and lasting happiness will result: the kind that can only come from following God\u2019s design. Aim for mere \u201chappiness\u201d and you\u2019ll end up with nothing - as you will in all other hedonic pursuits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"modernist-criticisms\">Modernist Criticisms</h2>\n<p>Here are some common criticisms directed against the institution of marriage by modernists.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lifespans\">Lifespans</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The notion of lifetime monogamy comes from a time when the average life expectancy was less than 40. It\u2019s simply unrealistic to expect people to stay together or even stay friends over an 80+ year lifespan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This assertion of shorter lifespans in the past \u2014 which is used to explain everything from divorce to cancer rates \u2014 is based on faulty reasoning. Yes, it\u2019s true that the statistical average lifespan was a lot lower 100 years ago. However, it\u2019s important to understand that most of our \u201cincreased average lifespan\u201d is due to the dramatic decrease in infant and early childhood mortality \u2014 thanks to sanitation, antibotics, vaccines, etc. (Yes, I know some vaccines have problems\u2026 that\u2019s <a href=\"https://raypatrick.xyz/blog/2021/11/24/the-morality-of-vaccine-refusal\">another discussion entirely.</a>)</p>\n<p>But back in the old days, if you managed to pass through the childhood disease gauntlet, you had almost as good a chance to live to a ripe old age as modern people do. Look at your own family tree. You\u2019ll probably discover \u2014 as I did \u2014 plenty of people who lived to ripe old ages, with little or no medical care. And the ones who lived til their 80s or 90s, stayed married til death did them part.</p>\n<p>Simply put, the \u201caverage lifespan was 40\u201d doesn\u2019t mean everyone dropped dead at 40. An equally simplistic picture, but one which is much closer to the truth, is to say that half the population died as infants, and the other half lived to 80, hence the \u201c40 average.\u201d</p>\n<h3 id=\"morality-is-subjective\">Morality is Subjective</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ok, so <em>some</em> people think it\u2019s a sin or whatever to have sex outside marriage or to raise children without being married or to divorce when you\u2019re unhappy and drag your kids along to two or three other marriages. But how can they tell me what to do? That\u2019s a moral thing, and morality is subjective.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ve pointed out before that <a href=\"https://raypatrick.xyz/blog/2022/03/28/atheist-materialists-cannot-coherently-supportukraine\">morality cannot exist apart from teleology</a> and that <a href=\"https://raypatrick.xyz/blog/2022/05/01/there-are-no-good-people\">it is objective</a>, so I won\u2019t rehash those arguments here. Yet I will demonstrate that, even absent any religious motivation, there is a very good reason that rules for marriage were established. As with traffic rules, you ignore them at your own peril.</p>\n<p>Early rules of morality were rational. Morality wasn\u2019t arbitrarily made up by men to control flighty, helpless women; it promoted (and still does) the kind of basic order that ensures a future for civilization. And yes, \u201ceconomic\u201d is the correct word \u2013 not in the modern sense of a complex \u201ceconomy\u201d full of variables and conditions, but the basic economics of survival \u2013 natural consequences. Some of the most wise words I\u2019ve ever heard, came from an econ professor at a liberal arts college. \u201cEvery decision is an economic decision, an analysis of cost and benefit.\u201d In a world of surplus resources, it\u2019s easy to become oblivious to the real costs and real benefits of our actions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"marriage-is-stifling\">Marriage is Stifling</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Religion and, by extension, marriage, is just a control mechanism from medieval times that lets the powerful meddle in our lives. I\u2019m going to do whatever I want instead because I\u2019m a free man!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Who\u2019s more free? <a href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/modern-freedom-means-being-a-slave-to-impulses/\">A drug addict or someone who\u2019s not a drug addict only because his society makes it difficult for him to get started?</a></p>\n<p>It\u2019s interesting to note that the very root of the word \u201creligion\u201d is <em>ligare</em>, a Latin word meaning to bind, as with a cord. (From <em>ligare</em> we get our word <em>ligament.</em>) Unlike what you\u2019d see with a con perpetrated on unsuspecting peasants, the word to describe what we do in service to God and man was <em>intentionally chosen from the beginning</em> to mean \u201csomething that binds.\u201d Any well-adjusted adult knows that discipline is essential for a good life. The Christian takes it even further: he does not seek to gratify his every desire as a base hedonist; nor does he attempt to fully detach himself from all thoughts like some mystical Eastern ascetic. Rather, he meditates on the things of God and seeks to order his thoughts rightly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"god-is-love-la-de-da\">\u201cGod is Love, La-de-da\u201d</h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t be deceived - plenty of modernists dress up their arguments in religious language. The irony is, they\u2019re right. God <em>is</em> love. Marriage <em>is</em> about love. The problem is that they haven\u2019t the first clue what <em>love</em> really is.</p>\n<p>Love isn\u2019t something you feel, it\u2019s something you do. Love involves sacrifice and serving the other. The childish modern preoccupation with needing constant novelty and excitement and butterflies every moment for a \u201cromantic\u201d relationship to be valid is tragically misguided. A husband and wife are already as close as two people can be - through the mystery of one flesh. Love in this context will of course result in much affection and enjoyment and laughter. Love in marriage creates an immensely comforting safeguard from the cares and worries of the world. Far from being some fleeting target that must be chased, it often permeates so completely the souls of the man and woman involved that they may spend hours at a time blissfully sitting by the fire without needing to speak one word aloud.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>(credit <a href=\"https://dalrock.wordpress.com/\">Dalrock</a> for most of these insights)</p>\n<p>What the moderns and postmoderns (and sadly, most modern Christians) have done is place romantic love above marriage. Instead of seeing marriage as the moral context to pursue romantic love and sex, romantic love is now seen as the moral place to experience sex and marriage. This inversion is subtle enough that no one seems to have noticed, but if you look for it you will see it everywhere. (If I had been thinking clearly I would have named it as one of the enemy\u2019s <a href=\"https://raypatrick.xyz/blog/2022/05/16/stealth-weapons\">stealth weapons.</a> <a href=\"https://raypatrick.xyz/blog/2022/05/16/stealth-weapons#stealth-weapon-1-your-personal-happiness-is-paramount\">SW1</a> comes close.)</p>\n<p>Lifetime marriage, with separate defined roles for husband and wife and true commitment is what makes sex and romantic love moral in the biblical view. In our new view, romantic love makes sex moral, and the purpose of marriage is to publicly declare that you are experiencing the highest form of romantic love. Thus people now commonly refer to a wedding as \u201cmaking our love official\u201d.</p>\n<p>In contrast, within Christian sexual morality there is the marriage bed, and then there is fornication. The new, false version of sexual morality replaces that with the female preferred form of promiscuity (serial monogamy). Fornication becomes moral if it there is \u201ccommitment\u201d (male investment) and romantic love involved. What this does is ensure that the promiscuous female can secure investment from the men she has sex with. If this were instead feral male sexuality presented as morality the rule would be that sex was moral so long as the woman was willing to be part of a harem. In reality, there is no commitment on the table here: only two parties engaged in promiscuous sex. Our feminist culture teaches us that promiscuous sex is moral if men agree to play the promiscuity game on the woman\u2019s terms. How many people do you know who would even notice a problem with this?</p>\n<p>I would guess that 99% of pastors would be astonished if they could understand how intensely beautiful biblical marriage actually is, in all of its profound simplicity. Instead, when many preach from Ephesians 5 or 1 Corinthians 7 (if they even do so), they have to sprinkle in a generous amount of \u201cOh, I know the Bible says\u201dsubmit to your husband,&quot; but what it REALLY means is \u2026&quot; They keep trying to put ketchup on lobster to cover up the taste. Marriage is of course complex, but if you follow the incredibly simple rules set out in the NT it is something of intense beauty, what engineers and mathematicians refer to when they say \u201celegant\u201d.</p>", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": [], "user": "Thomas Pain", "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2022-06-03T10:01:36.564116+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/02/eu_child_protection/?td=keepreading-top", "language": "en", "age": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": true, "artist": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://www.theregister.com", "title": "Europe's hope to scan devices for unlawful files criticized \u2022 The Register", "thumbnail": null, "description": "Antivirus-but-for-pictures would trample rights, not even work as expected, say academics", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": [], "user": "Thomas Pain", "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2022-06-03T08:54:59.539174+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2022/06/01/ev-online-sales-ford-uber-lyft/7474822001/", "language": "en-US", "age": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": true, "artist": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://eu.usatoday.com", "title": "Ford EVs will be online only with a nonnegotiable price", "thumbnail": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/04/26/PDTF/9fdcfd9d-0cbe-4af8-a8d7-1bfff970f0b8-FordLighting_042622_ES06.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2399,1350,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "description": "Ford boss expects car just for Uber, Lyft and a price war benefitting consumers, among other big changes in the auto industry.", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["war", "oligarchs", "russia"], "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2022-06-03T08:01:38+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_businessmen_mystery_deaths", "language": "en", "age": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": true, "artist": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "title": "2022 Russian businessmen mystery deaths", "thumbnail": null, "description": "2022 Russian businessmen mystery deaths", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["blm", "black lives matter", "hate speech", "usa", "racism"], "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2022-06-03T06:58:22+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1124962.pdf", "language": "en-US", "age": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": true, "artist": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://files.eric.ed.gov", "title": "A Framework for Understanding Whiteness in Mathematics Education", "thumbnail": null, "description": "A Framework for Understanding Whiteness in Mathematics Education", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["what is a woman", "gender", "newspeak", "the left wing", "lgbt"], "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2022-06-03T00:00:00+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 50.0, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdDB8wU73NA", "language": "en-US", "age": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": true, "artist": null, "source_obj__id": 277, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCO01ytfzgXYy4glnPJm4PPQ", "title": "Matt Walsh Revisits His What Is A Woman Interview With Dr. Forcier", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zdDB8wU73NA/maxresdefault.jpg", "description": "LIKE & SUBSCRIBE for new videos every day.\n\nMatt Walsh revisits the interview he had with Dr. Forcier during the filming of his documentary What Is A Woman?\n\nWatch my new Daily Wire original documentary \u201cWhat Is A Woman?\u201d\u00a0 at https://whatisawoman.com\n\nI am a beloved LGBTQ+ and children\u2019s author.

More and more countries are voicing their desire for digital sovereignty and techno-isolationism. \n\nExperts are worried this cyber-balkanization is creating a multi-verse of national Internets and corporate walled gardens that they refer to as the Splintertnet.\n\nIf Internet can be understood as a worldwide network of all networks, Splinternet would be the opposite of that. It is when nations stop participating in the ICANN consensus and begin assigning their own IP addresses. It is also when governments setup nationwide firewalls to restrict free flow of information to and from the country. Both of these trends are already well on their way to create the world\u2019s first Splinternet. \n\nSources\n[0] https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-computer-networking.html\n[1] https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/effect-2012-02-25-en\n[2] https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/what-2012-02-25-en\n[3] https://techonomy.com/welcome-to-the-splinternet/\n[4] https://www.economist.com/briefing/2010/09/02/a-virtual-counter-revolution\n[5] https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/03/17/1047352/russia-splinternet-risk/ \n[6] https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/03/tech/ukraine-russia-internet-icann/index.html\n[7] https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-10/russia-internet-isolation-accelerates-after-ukraine-invasion\n[8] https://fortune.com/2022/03/22/russia-war-ukraine-great-firewall-splinternet-internet/\n[9] https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-disconnected-global-internet-tests-rbc-daily-2021-07-22/ \n[10] https://www.reuters.com/article/amazon-cloud-idUSN1E7A727Q20111109\n[11] https://www.statista.com/topics/4418/amazon-web-services/\n[12] https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/ \n[13] https://about.facebook.com/meta \n[14] https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/27/technology/apple-screen-time-trackers.html\n[15] https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/\n[16] https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20907228/apple-quartz-app-store-china-removal-hong-kong-protests-censorship\n[17] https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/business/media/new-york-times-apps-apple-china.html?\n[18] https://www.reuters.com/business/oracle-says-it-has-suspended-all-operations-russia-2022-03-02/\n[19] https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russian-splinternet-014035581.html\n[20] https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/22/social-media-election-facebook-filter-bubbles\n[21] https://qz.com/1194566/google-is-finally-admitting-it-has-a-filter-bubble-problem/\n[22] https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/the-walls-are-closing-in-chinafinds-new-ways-to-tighten-internet-controls/2017/09/26/2e0d3562-9ee6-11e7-b2a7-bc70b6f98089_story.html\n[23] https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/the-splinternet-is-already-here/\n[24] https://www.ft.com/content/ba94c2bc-6e27-11ea-9bca-bf503995cd6f\nPeer-to-peer services\nBriar: https://briarproject.org/\nCwtch: https://cwtch.im/\n\nCredits\nMusic by: White Bat Audio https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteBatAudio\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": [], "user": "Thomas Pain", "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "date_published": "2022-05-12T16:38:25.093981+00:00", "page_rating": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "https://medium.com/@katelyngadd/why-i-quit-googles-webassembly-team-and-how-it-made-me-sick-c50ef562ce1", "language": "en", "age": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "bookmarked": true, "artist": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://medium.com", "title": "Why I Quit Google\u2019s WebAssembly Team, And How It Made Me Sick | by Katelyn Gadd | May, 2022 | Medium", "thumbnail": null, "description": "I joined Google in early 2015 to work on the V8 team as one of the first authors of the WebAssembly specification.

It's tempting to watch the big players and fantasize about how great it must be to be in their shoes, or to adopt the hustle mentality and quickly work your way into burnout, but sometimes it's good to listen to the stories of those who've been there and walked away, to understand that life is about a whole lot more than \"the grind\". \n\n------------------------------\nCREDITS:\n\nAndrei Terbea -

In this video, he talks about some childhood memories while living in Philadelphia in the 1860s.  It was filmed on June 21, 1932.  This video has been colorized, speed-adjusted and restored with audio enhancements for clarity.\nNote: Thomson meant to say \"75 years ago\" rather than \"65 years ago\" in the beginning.  His family shipped over to America in 1857. \n\nOur new music channel - Life in the Music\n2-hour videos of music from the 1600s-1900s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24pSII56FIBAAI3FAu_ygw/featured\n\nElihu Thomson was born March 29, 1853, in Manchester, England. His father,\nwho worked as a mill mechanic, was thrown out of work in 1857 and decided to\nemigrate to the United States. In 1858 the family settled in Philadelphia,\nwhere Elihu grew up. His father's work as a mechanic stimulated Thomson's\ninterest in mechanical and chemical processes. From his early teens he read\nwidely, built models, and conducted simple chemical experiments. At\nPhiladelphia's Central High School Thomson was an outstanding student who\nattracted the interest of his instructors. Upon graduating in 1870 he was\noffered a teaching position at the school.\n\nBetween 1870 and 1880 Thomson taught high school in Philadelphia. At the same\ntime he and a fellow teacher named Edwin J. Houston experimented with\nelectricity and succeeded in building a practical electric arc lighting\nsystem. In 1879 a group of New England businessmen took an interest in\nthe Thomson-Houston arc lighting system and offered to finance its fabrication.\nIn 1880 Thomson moved to New Britain, Connecticut, as the company's chief\nengineer. By 1881 Thomson had designed the best arc lighting system in the\ncountry, but sales were slow. In 1882 a group of Lynn, Massachusetts,\nbusinessmen purchased the company and changed the name to the Thomson-Houston Electric Company.\n\nFor this video, I colorized it using AI optimization software, interpolated it to 60 frames/second, speed-adjusted it and refined it with De Blur, Sharpness and Stabilization.  For the audio, I remastered it using noise gate, compression, loudness normalization, EQ and a Limiter.  \n\nThis video is made for educational purposes for fair use under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976.", "album": null}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["funny", "programming"], "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 2, "comments": [], "date_published": "2022-03-19T00:00:00+00:00", "page_rating": 52, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzRfvwo1iNU", "language": "en", "age": 0, "page_rating_contents": 52, "bookmarked": true, "artist": null, "source_obj__id": 317, "page_rating_votes": 0, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCi8C7TNs2ohrc6hnRQ5Sn2w", "title": "Interview with Senior PHP Developer", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GzRfvwo1iNU/maxresdefault.jpg", "description": "PHP programming language\nInterview with a PHP developer with Paul Ron -

The proposal, named Project Defuse, was rejected by DARPA over safety concerns and the notion that it violates the basis gain of function research moratorium.\n \nAccording to the documents, NIAID, under the direction of Dr. Fauci, went ahead with the research in Wuhan, China and at several sites across the U.S.\n \nDr. Fauci has repeatedly maintained, under oath, that the NIH and NIAID have not been involved in gain of function research with the EcoHealth Alliance program. But according to the documents obtained by Project Veritas which outline why EcoHealth Alliance\u2019s proposal was rejected, DARPA certainly classified the research as gain of function. \n\n\u201cThe proposal does not mention or assess potential risks of Gain of Function (GoF) research,\u201d a direct quote from the DARPA rejection letter.\n\nMajor Murphy\u2019s report goes on to detail great concern over the COVID-19 gain of function program, the concealment of documents, the suppression of potential curatives, like Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine, and the mRNA vaccines.\n \nProject Veritas reached out to DARPA for comment regarding the hidden documents and spoke with the Chief of Communications, Jared Adams, who said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound normal to me,\u201d when asked about the way the documents were shrouded in secrecy. \u201cIf something resides in a classified setting, then it should be appropriately marked,\u201d Adams said. \u201cI\u2019m not at all familiar with unmarked documents that reside in a classified space, no.\u201d\n\nIn a video breaking this story published on Monday night, Project Veritas CEO, James O\u2019Keefe, asked a foundational question to DARPA:\n\n\u201cWho at DARPA made the decision to bury the original report? They could have raised red flags to the Pentagon, the White House, or Congress, which may have prevented this entire pandemic that has led to the deaths of 5.4 million people worldwide and caused much pain and suffering to many millions more.\u201d\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci has not yet responded to a request for comment on this story.\n\nAbout Project Veritas\nJames O'Keefe established Project Veritas in 2010 as a non-profit journalism enterprise to continue his undercover reporting work. Today, Project Veritas investigates and exposes corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions to achieve a more ethical and transparent society and to engage in litigation to: protect, defend and expand human and civil rights secured by law, specifically First Amendment rights including promoting the free exchange of ideas in a digital world; combat and defeat censorship of any ideology; promote truthful reporting; and defend freedom of speech and association issues including the right to anonymity.
