Specifically, the AG's office claimed that Google repeatedly prompted users to switch in location tracking in certain apps and informed them that certain features wouldn't work properly if location tracking wasn't on. Racine and his team found that location data wasn't even needed for the app in question. They asserted that Google made it &quot;impossible for users to opt out of having their location tracked.&quot;</p><p>The $9.5 million payment is a paltry one for Google. Last quarter, it took parent company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/alphabet/\"><ins>Alphabet</ins></a> under 20 minutes to make that much in revenue. The changes that the company will make to its practices as part of <a href=\"https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2022-12/2022.12.29%20DC-Google%20Settlement%20Agreement%20%5Bfor%20signature%5D.pdf\">the settlement</a> may have a bigger impact.</p><p>Folks who currently have certain location settings on will receive notifications telling them how they can disable each setting, delete the associated data and limit how long Google can keep that information. Users who set up a new Google account will be informed which location-related account settings are on by default and offered the chance to opt out.</p><p>Google will need to maintain a webpage that details its location data practices and policies. This will include ways for users to access their location settings and details about how each setting impacts Google's collection, retention or use of location data.</p><p>Moreover, Google will be prevented from sharing a person's precise location data with a third-party advertiser without the user's explicit consent. The company will need to delete location data &quot;that came from a device or from an IP address in web and app activity within 30 days&quot; of obtaining the information</p><p>&quot;Given the vast level of tracking and surveillance that technology companies can embed into their widely used products, it is only fair that consumers be informed of how important user data, including information about their every move, is gathered, tracked, and utilized by these companies,&quot; Racine said in a statement. &quot;Significantly, this resolution also provides users with the ability and choice to opt of being tracked, as well as restrict the manner in which user information may be shared with third parties.&quot;</p><p>Engadget has contacted Google for comment.</p>", "link":

Since more than a decade I've been using an always-on VPN on all my devices through a VPS I operate (various cloud providers along the years).\nAlso for context, I stopped using all google services around 2015 or thereabouts - although I still have an account I no longer use it.\nThe only google service that I use rarely is google maps - of course, never logged on.\nAnd a few times a month I use google search for the odd obscure thing.<p>Around 2016 was the first time I noticed that google.com was showing at the bottom of the page my ZIP code. It felt very unusual but I was in the process of moving so I didn't pay too much attention. To my surprise, a few weeks later google.com was showing my new ZIP code.<p>I shopped around for cloud providers that would allow me to rotate the instance IP easily and thankfully there are many but I was curious how come google picked it up - the only plausible reason was using location data from the Google Maps iOS app.<p>Here's how you can replicate this.<p>Get a cheap VPS from a country different than yours. Get an iOS device (ideally an (older?) iPhone but I think it should work on an iPad) - Android devices should be excluded from this test for obvious reasons.\nReset it to factory defaults (optional but removes moving parts and false leads like cookies etc).<p>Install wireguard (or your preferred always-on vpn) and configure the VPS to be used as an exit node.\nInstall google maps (don't login of course) - can be used without being logged on just fine.\nInstall firefox focus (Safari in Private Window mode would work as well).<p>Confirm via ipinfo (or your preferred whatsmyip website) that you're using the VPS IP\nGo to google.com and confirm it's showing at the bottom of the page the country of the VPS (could also be shown in a different language if google has a presence in that country).<p>Use the google maps app a few times a day (ideally navigate from a place to another) - it will take about 2-3 weeks but you'll notice that google.com will now show your actual country for the VPS IP and also the google.com language will change to your own.<p>If you want to take it one step further, continue to use google maps on the iOS device. You'll notice that after a few more weeks, google.com will show your actual City (based on the IP) - and after a while longer it will be even more precise, will show your ZIP code.<p>You have to be patient though, it will take 2-4 weeks to start with - and it's imperative that that IP address is dedicated to this test.<p>Funny enough, I was on holiday on Mexico for a month right before reading the HN article I mentioned (have been using a VPS in the states for lower latency) and I noticed that after 2 weeks the language changed to Spanish and google.com was showing Mexico (I rotated the IP when this happened and it prompted me to write this 'Tell HN'.<p>Not surprisingly but Google doesn't share the new GeoIP data - MaxMind, ipinfo and others never changed their location data for that IP - they showed the original geoip even a few weeks after google changed theirs - haven't checked longer than that - it could be shared eventually.<p>In conclusion - I can't say that I'm surprised Google is using the Maps location data - and I don't think there's any way to prevent it (outside of not running Maps - but unfortunately it's one of the few ways of checking restaurant reviews).\nMy \"workaround\" is to periodically rotate my VPS IP and move on with life :)<p>Thanks for reading - I hope you found this useful.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34052786\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34052786</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34052786", "date_published": "2022-12-19T14:57:24+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "tags": ["privacy", "tracking", "google"]}, {"source": "http://www.msn.com/rss/news.aspx", "title": "Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers if he should step down as the company's CEO. 57.5% voted 'yes.'", "description": "", "link": "http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/elon-musk-asked-his-twitter-followers-if-he-should-step-down-as-the-company-s-ceo-57-5-voted-yes/ar-AA15rBNV?li=BBnbcA1&srcref=rss", "date_published": "2022-12-19T11:51:04.032922+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "tags": ["elon musk"]}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "In 2022, I decided to get away from screens and read more books.

One lone employee from China said, \"You know, I've seen this movie before... do not recommend.\"</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"78656\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32332863&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>We already know <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-engineer-free-speech\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter's \"commie as f*ck\" employees don't believe in free speech</a>.

In fact, you're being told two main lies: the first is how high inflation actually is. But the second is who is truly responsible for a large part of inflation happening.\n\nWhen we hear about inflation, we're told that it's primarily caused by the simple economics of money in the system. More money is printed, resulting in dollars becoming devalued, resulting in stuff getting more expensive. And yes, this is definitely a part of the inflation equation. However, there's a part that's often missed that in many cases, causes prices around us to rise as well.\n\nTo put it simply, it's all about corporate greed. And the desire of many companies to use inflation as a cover story for rising prices, so they can line their pockets. It's only possible they can do this due to lack of competition, which is something we don't think we have in today's world.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts below.\n\n0:00 - The big lies about inflation\n0:55 - LIE 1: How high inflation really is\n3:00 - The main narrative around inflation\n3:26 - LIE 2: What is causing inflation\n5:17 - Why competition is a myth\n6:59 - Concentration of corporate power\n\n\u25ba IMPORTANT LINKS:\nEnter your email via the link below for free weekly lessons and insights into becoming financially free, investing, global tax and corporate structures, passports, residencies, and more.\nJOIN: https://www.abundantia.co/\n\n\u25ba SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u2022 Abundantia Instagram: @abundantia.co https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/\n\u2022 Sorelle's Instagram: @sorelleamore  https://instagram.com/sorelleamore\n\u2022 Leon's Instagram: @leonhill  https://instagram.com/leonhill\n\u2022 Abundantia Twitter: https://twitter.com/abundantiaco\n\u2022 Abundantia Facebook: http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance\n\nSorelle and Leon.\nFounders, Abundantia\n\nLiability Disclaimer: https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer\n*We may earn a commission if you buy any products or services via the links in this video's description.

You could opt out of targeted ads on Facebook or Instagram if you'd rather not have the social networks track your activity. You can already decline customized ads using data from third-party apps and sites.</p><p>The board's decision wouldn't directly force Meta to change. Rather, it would ask Ireland's Data Protection Commission to apply matching orders. As Meta's European operations are officially based in Ireland, the company would have to comply.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Both data boards acknowledged that there had been decisions, but didn't comment on what they entailed. We've asked Meta for comment. A spokesperson for the social media giant said it was \"too early to speculate,\" and that the EU might still offer legal backing for targeted ads. The company argued that it had \"fully\" engaged with the Data Protection Commission's inquiries.</p><p>If the EU does restrict Meta's personalization, it could have a significant impact on the company's bottom line. With fewer users willing to accept targeted ads, there may be fewer people clicking those ads and encouraging advertisers to spend more on campaigns. Meta was already worried about <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-ios-app-tracking-notices-192117307.html\">Apple's App Tracking Transparency</a>, and warned that it might cost $10 billion in sales when it launched in 2021. The reported European measure could also prove costly, especially as it would affect Android and the web.</p><p>The EU might not be very sympathetic, as its officials have penalized Meta more than once for purported privacy violations.

CBDC stands for Central Bank Digital Currency, and is a new form of digital money that is on the horizon for just about every nation on Earth.\n\nCBDCs have already been launched fully in 11 countries, but are being tested in more than 100, including in nations that account for more than 95% of our planet's total GDP. In other words, if a CBDC hasn't hit your country yet, it very likely will soon. The criticism around CBDCs is that they will be used as the ultimate tool of surveillance and control, allowing governments to monitor citizens' every move. However, the United States and the Netherlands are already implementing laws to do just that, potentially requiring new reporting standards on almost all transactions.\n\nThe truth is, there may not be a lot we can do to stop a CBDC from arriving in our nations. But we can refuse to use one when they arrive, if they are as terrible for financial freedom as many believe.\n\nIn any case, I would love to hear your thoughts. And thank you for being here for 100 videos on this channel.\n\n0:00 - A world of financial control\n1:19 - New Dutch and American surveillance laws\n2:35 - CBDCs are coming soon\n5:29 - NordVPN insert\n6:53 - Concerns surrounding CBDCs\n9:51 - Controlling people with money\n11:18 - What can we do?\n\n\u25ba IMPORTANT LINKS:\nEnter your email via the link below for free weekly lessons and insights into becoming financially free, investing, global tax and corporate structures, passports, residencies, and more.\nJOIN: https://www.abundantia.co/\n\n\u25ba SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u2022 Abundantia Instagram: @abundantia.co https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/\n\u2022 Sorelle's Instagram: @sorelleamore  https://instagram.com/sorelleamore\n\u2022 Leon's Instagram: @leonhill  https://instagram.com/leonhill\n\u2022 Abundantia Twitter: https://twitter.com/abundantiaco\n\u2022 Abundantia Facebook: http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance\n\nSorelle and Leon.\nFounders, Abundantia\n\nLiability Disclaimer: https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer\n*We may earn a commission if you buy any products or services via the links in this video's description.

Peterson and Dr. Yoram Hazony discuss the major problems plaguing today's youths, such as the resurgence of Marxism under the guise of woke morality, the creation of aimless social hierarchies that leave participants devoid of meaning, and the complete lack of respect for adverse thinking that has lead to the deterioration of our foundational principles.\n \nDr. Yoram Hazony is an Israeli author,  philosopher, political theorist, and Bible scholar. In 1994, Dr. Hazony founded the Shalem Center in Jerusalem, which became Shalem College in 2013. Being the first liberal arts college in Israel, it attracted widespread attention, followed by much acclaim as many of the country's renowned intellectuals joined its staff. Hazony has also served as director of the John Templeton Foundation's project in Jewish Philosophical Theology, as well as a member of the Israel Council for Higher Education committee. Dr. Hazony has published many books, his 2018 work, The Virtue of Nationalism, being awarded Conservative Book of the Year in 2019. He also maintains a regularly published blog, Jerusalem Letters, that explores the topics of philosophy, politics, Judaism, Israel, and higher education. Other writings by Dr. Hazony have been published in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and American Affairs.\n\n\u2014Links\u2014 \n\nFor Dr. Yoram Hazony:\n\nGet your copy of

Those documents also reveal the bureau had developed guidelines for federal prosecutors detailing how the FBI\u2019s use of Pegasus would need to be disclosed during court cases.</p><p>Based on the documents, it\u2019s unclear if the FBI had considered using the spyware against American citizens. Earlier this year, <em>The Times </em>found that the agency had tested Phantom, a version of Pegasus that can target phones with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nso-group-spyware-us-state-department-report-183647765.html\"><ins>US numbers</ins></a>.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>By July 2021, the FBI eventually decided not to use Pegasus in criminal investigations.

A few months later, the US placed Pegasus creator NSO Group on the Commerce Department\u2019s entity list, a designation that prevents US companies from conducting business with the firm. Despite the decision not to use Pegasus, the FBI indicated it remains open to using spyware in the future.</p><p>\u201cJust because the FBI ultimately decided not to deploy the tool in support of criminal investigations does not mean it would not test, evaluate and potentially deploy other similar tools for gaining access to encrypted communications used by criminals,\u201d states a <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/nso-fbi-brief/f6199b0802b4fc01/full.pdf\"><ins>legal briefing</ins></a> filed by the FBI last month.</p><p>The documents appear to present a different picture of the agency\u2019s interest in Pegasus than the one FBI Director Chris Wray shared with Congress during a closed-doors hearing this past December. \u201cIf you mean have we used it in any of our investigations to collect or target somebody, the answer is - as I\u2019m assured - no,\u201d he <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/fbi-nso/58a69830f3cd2e7d/full.pdf\"><ins>said in response to a question from Senator Ron Wyden</ins></a>. \u201cThe reason why I hedge, and I want to be transparent, that we have acquired some of their tools for research and development.

It's basically a description of the extension and a list of what it wants to do on your browser.\n\nAs of now, most browser extensions use manifest V2, and, as with all specifications, manifest v2 is being updated with manifest v3. Its biggest changes are in using service workers instead of background pages, and using a new API to block or modify network requests.\n\nThe new API is where the problem with manifest v3 lies.\n\nRight now, with manifest v2, extensions have access to a feature called WebRequest. To summarize it quickly, it lets the extension look at the data going through a web browser, notably the calls it makes to various URLs, and it lets extensions act on them, stuff like blocking them, or modifying them.\n\nThis feature is the backbone of all privacy and adblocking extensions.\n\nIn Manifest v3, pushed heavily by Google, the Web Request API is gone. It's replaced by a new one called Declarative Net Request, and this new API basically prevents any extension from monitoring traffic. Extensions must declare in advance how they'll  handle certain types of requests, or they can't handle them at all. These extensions also won't be able to load code from outside of the currently displayed website.\n\nIt  means extensions lose some capabilities, notably the ability to act after the websitse server has answered the requests the browser made. Extensions need to say beforehand what they'll block, which means they need to know in advance what constitutes an ad or a tracker, and what isn't, when before, they could react in real time as the website called to various resources.\n\nhttps://blog.chromium.org/2019/06/web-request-and-declarative-net-request.html\n\nAnd that's where the problem is: this new API severely limits what browser extensions can do, and will make all ad blockers and privacy focused extensions a lot less useful.\n\nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening\n\nThis spec specifically destroys the capabilities of everything that currently hurts Google's business model.\n\nChrome and the chromium engine control the whole web. Chromium based browsers are about 85% of all desktop browsers. Globally, it's about 63% if we count mobile.\n\nThis means that extension developers, if they want their extension to reach users, HAVE to develop it for Chrome and chrome based browsers.\n\nFirefox is compatible with Chrome extensions, mostly, and developers generally don't have a ton of work to do to ensure that their extension runs on it as well. But with manifest v3, developers will have to maintain 2 versions of their extensions. One that runs on Chrome and chromium based browsers, and one that runs on Firefox.\n\nWhy would you do some extra work to maintain your extension for a browser that has very little market share worldwide?", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KWCLhHrblE", "date_published": "2022-09-19T00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8KWCLhHrblE/maxresdefault.jpg", "tags": ["corporatocracy", "ad business", "manifest v3", "google"]}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "The $300B Google-Meta advertising duopoly is under attack", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2022/09/18/the-300bn-google-meta-advertising-duopoly-is-under-attack\">https://www.economist.com/business/2022/09/18/the-300bn-google-meta-advertising-duopoly-is-under-attack</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32889929\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32889929</a></p>\n<p>Points: 70</p>\n<p># Comments: 39</p>", "link": "https://www.economist.com/business/2022/09/18/the-300bn-google-meta-advertising-duopoly-is-under-attack", "date_published": "2022-09-18T18:17:04+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "tags": ["google", "meta", "ad business"]}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "TikTok privacy policy says they monitor names of other installed apps", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy-us?lang=en\">https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy-us?lang=en</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32886241\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32886241</a></p>\n<p>Points: 44</p>\n<p># Comments: 23</p>", "link": "https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy-us?lang=en", "date_published": "2022-09-18T10:28:53+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "tags": ["privacy", "surveillance", "big tech", "corporatocracy", "technofeudalism", "tiktok"]}, {"source": "https://www.dailywire.com/feeds/rss.xml", "title": "School District Defends Trans Shop Teacher Whose Enormous Fake Breasts Spurred Internet Furor", "description": "A Canadian school district is standing behind a biologically male teacher whose wearing of massive prosthetic breasts created an online furor, according to a new report.

One that is not only basically believed by the whole world, but one that is running our nations, and being bought and paid for by your tax dollars.\n\nYou've definitely heard of \"Net Zero\" before. It was first popularised during the Paris Climate Agreement in 2016, hosted by the United Nations. And while they likely have the best interests of our planet at heart, there are of course massive entities (especially the world's oil companies) who are taking advantage of Net Zero. Mostly, so they can make lots and lots of money.\n\nThe worst thing is, one of the solutions being heralded as our best choice for achieving these goals is carbon capture and storage. Which isn't basically doing anything at all.

This is how it's done. Support independent research and analysis by joining my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone \n\nThe Internet is a giant network of privately owned spaces open to public, where every participant knows the exact identity and location of one another and where corporate stalking is a perfectly legitimate business model. If you are not okay with automated decisions being made about your every move, you should consider creating an anonymous identity.\n\nAnonymity is the most powerful mitigation strategy on a publicly observable network such as the Internet. It is the most direct path towards privacy. This guide will tell you exactly what you need to know and do in order to create and maintain your very own anonymous identity. \n\nThe Internet is a privacy nightmare because every action is by default identifiable and linkable. That means actions always lead to a unique location and/or account on the network and actions can built a profile over time. Linkability and identifiability are your biggest privacy and anonymity threats on the Internet. For maximum anonymity, both of these threats need to be mitigated to the fullest extent possible. \n\nOur first step with any service will be to dissociate our account details from our personal information. The second step is to compartmentalize our anonymous identities so that they are isolated from our personal identities.\n\nDissociation and isolation of your anonymous identities are not the only steps to keep your anonymity. Be extremely cautious of what types of data you submit to these services while using them. Always think of the linkability and identifiability threats when using these accounts. \n\nPRIVACY THREAT MODELING\nhttps://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/ \nLINDDUN strategy for threat modeling\nhttps://www.linddun.org/post/keys-to-successful-privacy-threat-modeling\nhttps://www.linddun.org/linddun \nhttps://www.linddun.org/_files/ugd/cc602e_cf7e4c6b1d894bdaabc3094c48b26869.pdf \nhttps://www.linddun.org/go-getting-started \nLinkability\nhttps://www.linddun.org/linkability \nIdentifiability\nhttps://www.linddun.org/identifiability-1 \nMitigation strategies\nhttps://www.linddun.org/mitigation-strategies-and-solutions \n\nRECOMMENDED TOOLS\nKeepassXC\nhttps://keepassxc.org/ \nBitwarden\nhttps://bitwarden.com/ \nFIDO security keys\nhttps://fidoalliance.org/what-is-fido/ \nGrapheneOS\nhttps://grapheneos.org/\nOrbot\nhttps://orbot.app/ \nTor Browser\nhttps://www.torproject.org/ \nTutanota\nhttps://tutanota.com/ \nProtonMail\nhttps://proton.me/ \nBriar\nhttps://briarproject.org/\nOnionShare\nhttps://onionshare.org/\nWire\nhttps://wire.com/en/\nMatrix/Element\nhttps://element.io/\nHow to anonymously install applications\nhttps://www.privacyguides.org/android/#obtaining-applications \nAurora Open Source Software\nhttps://auroraoss.com/\nHow to obtain an anonymous burner phone - The Intercept\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4gqRYkA9KE \nHow to obtain an anonymous burner phone - The Hated One\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMJH-UJyENs\n\nNEWS SOURCES\nGoogle location tracking\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/states-file-new-suits-against-google-over-location-tracking-11643037890 \nChainalysis\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/04/chainalysis-estimates-2b-stolen-from-cross-chain-bridge-hacks-this-year/ \n\nCredits\nMusic by: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcavSftXHgxLBWwLDm_bNvA\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_QsQp7DyjE", "date_published": "2022-08-13T15:12:14+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "tags": ["privacy", "tracking", "anonymity"]}, {"source": "https://www.wired.com", "title": "The Hacking of Starlink Terminals Has Begun | WIRED", "description": "It cost a researcher only $25 worth of parts to create a tool that allows custom code to run on the satellite dishes.", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/starlink-internet-dish-hack/", "date_published": "2022-08-13T10:18:22.913665+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "Thomas Pain", "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.fiod.nl", "title": "Arrest of suspected developer of Tornado Cash - FIOD", "description": "On Wednesday 10 August, the FIOD arrested a 29-year-old man in Amsterdam.

His stated goals were two-fold: Firstly, to rid the social media network of bots and other fake accounts. Secondly, to ensure Twitter was doing all it could to protect \u201cfree speech\u201d on its service.\n\nOver the past six months, Musk has joined the legions of activists on the political right who bemoan what they see as an overly-stringent approach to content moderation (or what they usually describe as \u201ccensorship\") on Twitter. They claim that this is stifling public discourse and taking away users\u2019 rights to freedom of speech and expression.\n\nBut what would a Muskian Twitter actually have looked like? Could he have seen-through his plans for securing \u201cfree speech\u201d on the platform? Or is it all a little bit more complicated than that.\n\nJoin me as we take a dive into the ways in which discussions around freedom of speech tend to fail, the history of the so-called \u201cmarketplace of ideas\u201d and what all of this might mean for how we look back on the attempt by Elon Musk to buy Twitter.\n\nSupport the channel on Patreon at http://patreon.com/tomnicholas\n\nIf you've enjoyed this video and would like to see more including my What The Theory? series in which I provide some snappy introductions to key theories in the humanities as well as video essays and more then do consider subscribing.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/tom_nicholas\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/tomnicholaswtf\nPatreon: http://patreon.com/tomnicholas\nWebsite: http://www.tomnicholas.com\n\nSelect footage courtesy of Getty\n\n#ElonMusk #Twitter #FreeSpeech", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79pS5OXKTkU", "date_published": "2022-07-29T18:30:12+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "tags": ["moderation", "censorship", "free speech"]}, {"source": "https://www.bloomberg.com", "title": "Sri Lanka Inflation Rises to 60.8% as Dollar Crunch Persists", "description": "Sri Lanka Inflation Rises to 60.8% as Dollar Crunch Persists", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-29/sri-lanka-inflation-climbs-to-60-8-as-dollar-crunch-persists", "date_published": "2022-07-29T14:09:02+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "thumbnail": null, "tags": ["sri lanka", "crisis"]}, {"source": "https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml", "title": "'Based' Paganism vs. Christianity", "description": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write about Paganism recently. I will frame it as a response to an email I received within the past day or so:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hey Luke,</p>\n<p>First off, I would like to thank you for all your efforts in making everything\nyou know accessible to everyone. You have exposed me to some of the most\nthought-provoking people on the internet and Varg is one of them. I was\nwondering if you can write an article or make a video on what you think about\nVarg&rsquo;s Paganism in relation to you choosing Orthodox Christianity. I know that\nyou briefly talked about it in one of your livestreams, however, I would like\nto better understand why you don&rsquo;t practice Paganism yourself. My background is\nSerbian and most Serbians follow the Serbian Orthodox Church, but after\nwatching Varg&rsquo;s videos, I&rsquo;m conflicted. I agree with a lot of what Varg says\nabout Christianity, but my father long ago told me to follow the Serbian\nOrthodox Church if I were to become religious. I&rsquo;m sure that many people feel\nthe same way after watching Varg&rsquo;s videos, and your thoughts on it would\ngreatly help people like me make up their minds.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p><em>redacted</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I will sum up my answer to this email in bullet points, then explain what I mean.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modern &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; is not a real thing and has nothing to do with paganism in history.</li>\n<li>The most direct cultural link between modern man and antiquity is the orthodox Christian Church.</li>\n<li>Truth matters&mdash;&ldquo;Picking&rdquo; a religion on personal preferences is brain-dead and self-refuting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"your-average-pagan\">Your Average Pagan</h2>\n<p>Many people probably don&rsquo;t know who Varg Vikernes is, but since the email brings him up, I will talk about him as an example of where paganism leads.\nModern &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; is not an authentic tradition handed down over the ages.\nIt is an attempt of modern disconnected people to recreate or re-engineer a culture, time and place they have absolutely no contact with.\nThis ultimately makes &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; a modernist Rorschach test where individuals can more-or-less create the religion they want.</p>\n<h3 id=\"paganism-with-modern-goggles\">Paganism with modern goggles</h3>\n<p>Varg&rsquo;s particular &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; is a kind of scientific euhemerism: he doesn&rsquo;t actually believe in gods in the way an ancient pagan would have, but that the concepts of the gods represent scientific or other knowledge.\n(This is where the placenta meme around him comes from after all, when he and his wife related assorted pagan myths and items to the tree-like appearance of a human placenta.)\nHe has also reduced classical abstract spiritual concepts into hormones and other related things.\nIn essence, he has created a pseudo-paganism that is compatible with modern materialism.</p>\n<p>Varg had cited and recommended works such as Frazer&rsquo;s <em>Golden Bough</em> as influential on his thought which is of a similar vein.\nThis book was part of a wider movement in the English-speaking rationalist world to rationalize and explain myth.\nIt goes without saying that I think this all comes from the assumption of modern man that all ancient people underlyingly thought like Neil deGrasse Tyson.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-long-until-legend-becomes-myth\">How long until legend becomes myth?</h3>\n<p>More plausible is the viewpoint I&rsquo;ve spoken of in works such as <a href=\"https://notrelated.xyz/#02.04\"><em>Hamlet&rsquo;s Mill</em></a>.\nIt alleges that <em>one specific</em> prehistoric civilization used myth to transmit scientific knowledge, but being thousands of years out from that civilization, the descendant stories are distorted, partial and can only be related after extensive study.\nThey allege that &ldquo;Hamlet stories&rdquo; are similar in origin and actually carry astrological information, including the idea of the procession of the equinoxes.</p>\n<p>But Varg&rsquo;s quasi-euhemerism makes a much stronger claim, that all our &ldquo;forebears&rdquo; (as he tends to call them) left an entire encyclopedia of scientific knowledge in stories that have remained unblemished and mostly unchanged over thousands or <em>millions</em> of years since the Neanderthals, who he views as the Trve Europeans.</p>\n<p>This stronger claim should be absurd on its face, as it assumes that over the millennia, there is little to no addition, subtraction or change of folklore.\nThe <em>Hamlet&rsquo;s Mill</em> model admits that this does happen, but Varg is dealing with a much longer scale and often makes very specific claims about some myths.\nWhat I think Varg is truly doing when he looks at a pagan myth and sees a placenta, he is seeing statistical noise and fitting that noise to the many possibilities in his head.\n(I will also say that this is somewhat the modus operandi of many capital-T &ldquo;Traditionalists&rdquo; in the vein of Evola or Gu\u00e9non.)</p>\n<aside>\nThis is principally a response to the theories that Varg put forth around 2016-2018 when I would occasionally watch his videos. I'm sure it's very possible that he endorses things very different now, since this \"paganism\" is not anything concrete.\n</aside>\n<h2 id=\"is-christianity-a-departure-from-european-tradition\">Is Christianity a departure from European tradition?</h2>\n<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve tried to emphasize <a href=\"https://notrelated.xyz/#02.02\">in some places</a> is the general wrongness of the idea of the cultural &ldquo;quantum leap&rdquo; or &ldquo;discontinuity&rdquo; between Prechristian and Christian Europe.\nThis is a highly important issue for many putative pagans, because they view the &ldquo;change&rdquo; of Europe over to Christianity as perhaps the start of the now constant and perpetual leftist cultural revolution.</p>\n<p>This is the idea, which most people and &ldquo;based&rdquo; pagans have even by osmosis, that the Christianization of Europe was a radical break from history and tradition.</p>\n<p>This is true only on the Christian metric: obviously the salvation of Europe is a quantum leap.\nHowever, melodramatic pagans will lament that this is when Europe have up its &ldquo;European&rdquo; soul and adopted a &ldquo;Jewish&rdquo; or &ldquo;desert&rdquo; religion which put the continent on a totally different and out-of-touch cultural direction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pagan-philosophy-and-christianity\">Pagan Philosophy and Christianity</h3>\n<p>Christian theology, including Trinitarian theology has direct and undeniable &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; analogues and imitators:\nNeoplatonism expresses a kind of theological trinity as well (the One, the Intellect and the Soul), albeit one more similar to Origen&rsquo;s trinity where a hierarchy of the three persons exist.</p>\n<p>In the cosmogony of the <em>Poemandres</em>, a Hermetic work, shows a pagan creation myth wherein God creates the world via his <em>Logos</em>, as in the first chapter of St. John&rsquo;s gospel, which also has a trinitarian and monotheistic unity with God (differing from Christianity in its panentheism).</p>\n<p>As I mentioned in the linked podcast <a href=\"https://notrelated.xyz/#02.02\">episode above</a>, Stoic philosophy is a component needed to understand the opening of the gospel of John and is part of the philosophical backdrop of early Christian theology.</p>\n<p>Medieval esoteric doctrines and alchemy viewed all of nature as trinitarian, possessing body, mind, and spirit (salt, sulfur and mercury), which was related directly to the Triune nature of God.\nEven specific mystical sects like Mithraism or the many forms of Gnosticism are tied closely to the development of Christianity.</p>\n<p>All of these intellectual strands were intertwined with Christianity since the beginning of the written expression of Christian theology.</p>\n<p>A pagan now has to ask himself: if Hermeticism or Mithraism had taken over as a universal religion of Europe, would they loathe it like they loathe Christianity and view it as a radical departure from &ldquo;paganism?&rdquo;\nNote that Hermeticism had an alleged Egyptian origin, and Mithraism had a orientalist/Iranic origin.</p>\n<p>Note that none of my point here is specifically that Christianity influenced or created these other philosophies or that they influenced (providentially) Christianity.\nWhat is important is that looking at it dispassionately, we cannot deem Christianity as some cultural departure from &ldquo;real&rdquo; European culture without also throwing out this entire philosophical tradition as a whole.</p>\n<p>Medieval Christians would often look at Greek Philosophy as another covenant of God established to prepare mankind intellectually for the revelation of the Trinity.\n(Note also that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCjX0il3wkc\">Dante and others</a> represent Christians who viewed the Roman Empire also as part of a divine plan.)</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the Christian religion is non-cultural and thus universal/catholic. There are cultural aspects associated with it, but there&rsquo;s a difference between essence and accidents.\nOf those cultural aspects, they are nearly all European, not, as some allege, Hebrew or Jewish.\nMost of the New Testament is quite literally an explication of why this religion which accepts the Hebrew Scriptures is markedly non-Jewish and why Jewish practices like circumcision and sacrifice are sacrilegious.</p>\n<p>So the view we should get from this is that Christianization was no cultural leap into an alien worldview, but something whose intellectual side happened slowly over centuries and would only be viewed as spiritual, not culturally distinct from its environment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"which-change-is-good\">Which change is good?</h3>\n<p>Note that even Varg admits that religious interpretation and practice changes with the centuries.\nIn his interpretation and even in his RPG, MYFAROG (which is really just an expression of his paganism and worldview), characters can have one of two &ldquo;Life Stances&rdquo; or religious inclinations: <em>Sei\u00f0r</em> or  <em>\u00c2satr\u00fb</em>.\nSei\u00f0r &ldquo;tradition,&rdquo; represents a kind of animism, witchcraft or spell-casting, while \u00c2satr\u00fb represents the worship of pagan gods.\nCharacters can choose either life stance, but one can only change from Sei\u00f0r to \u00c2satr\u00fb, which is a representation of the alleged historical shift in early history from animistic to polytheistic practices.</p>\n<p>If we accept this cultural transition as &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; in terms of cultural continuity, on what grounds could we also mark as verboten a shift from polytheism to monotheism?\nAfter all, the pagan philosophy of Plato and Aristotle even from the earliest was monotheistic at its core, and even today, the world&rsquo;s one remaining &ldquo;polytheistic&rdquo; religion, Hinduism only appears so on the surface, but has at its core its own monad and final cause: Brahman.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tradition-vs-inventing-your-own-religion\">Tradition vs. Inventing your own religion</h2>\n<p>To learn of Christian theology, thus, is to set oneself down a road of millennia of learning with often with no delineation between Christian and Prechristian thought.\nBy the same token, learning of secular philosophy, even as an atheist might lead you to Christianity, as was the case with me.\nThere is no obvious discontinuity, either in thought or practice.</p>\n<p>But modern day &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; does indeed have such a gap.\nTo be a &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; does not involve communing with a centuries-old tradition passed down generation-to-generation from antiquity.</p>\n<p>It is modern people imagining based on T.V. shows, books and their own creativity what Prechristian Europe was like and then putting on their own imitation of it.\nThey might see something they dislike in the world, blame it on Christians and then imagine a world without it.\nThis invariably comes with retrojecting their own modern values and assumptions on the past.</p>\n<p>After all, we Christians can sit down with an Orthodox Priest or grow up in a Orthodox household and have a direct, personal contact with a tradition and understand how people who are part of it think and act.\nWe have no tangible contact with Prechristian European paganism, even out of intellectual interest.\nUnderstanding how Europeans truly thought and acted is an issue of cultural reconstruction and theory.\nTraditional folklore and practices are still very much alive, but they are now decked in a Christian garb.\nWe do celebrate Christmas for Our Lord&rsquo;s birth, but everyone knows that nearly all of the practices of that season of the many nations of Europe predate Christianization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-worst-possible-decision\">The Worst Possible Decision.</h3>\n<p>All this said, the absolute worst self-own possible would be someone who has direct and easy access to the Orthodox Church and abandons it or leaves it for a false &ldquo;religion&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t even exist off of the internet and has no organic connection to reality, like Neo-Paganism.</p>\n<p>So my recommendation to the emailer above should be obvious.</p>\n<p>Being physically close to the Orthodox Church is a huge asset, but even being able to travel to one occasionally is a massive grace. Everyone should be taking advantage of that as often as possible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pagan-gurus\">Pagan Gurus</h3>\n<p>Because it is ungrounded and ahistorical, modern &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; thus naturally exists as a kind of extreme Protestant guru-centered feel-goodery where since there is absolutely no tether to a genuine preserved tradition, a man can make up an unfalsifiable claim about what true &ldquo;Paganism&rdquo; is and sell it as legit.</p>\n<p>I mentioned Varg earlier, who has concocted a &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; that consists in claiming that their lore and practice embed scientific information.\nHe doesn&rsquo;t <em>believe</em> in pagan gods, unless we&rsquo;re talking about belief in a very evasive and meaningless Jordan Peterson kind of way.\nIf we could actually transport a prehistoric pagan to our day and speak to him, he would probably either be confused or bemused by this very modern worldview, but we can&rsquo;t even do this.</p>\n<p>Most pagans are not &ldquo;based&rdquo; like Varg anyway (he lives a minimalist and traditional lifestyle in rural France with an ever-growing family).\nMost &ldquo;pagans&rdquo; are leftists who like &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; because they hate God and nature and morality and imagine that pagans were demented sexual perverts like they are.</p>\n<h2 id=\"truth\">Truth</h2>\n<p>Notice that I had specifically avoided the most important issue: Truth.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve done this because when people are asking to convert to something just because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;based,&rdquo; <em>Truth</em> is unfortunately not necessarily their concern, so I&rsquo;ve first addressed issues that do concern them.</p>\n<p>The reality is, thankfully, that truth is the most &ldquo;based&rdquo; thing of all&mdash;And it is entirely cringe to believe in something because it sounds cool to you.\nIf you think you can decide your own truth, you are no different from someone who thinks they can decide their own pronouns, literally.</p>\n<p>Even in the email above, he refers to me &ldquo;choosing&rdquo; orthodox Christianity as if it were an issue of personal taste.\nIf I liked pop music and people rolling on the ground, perhaps I would be just as justified converting to some Pentecostal sect.\nThis is silly.</p>\n<p>The greatest deception is that religion is this separate category about &ldquo;feelings&rdquo; or &ldquo;preference&rdquo; and not truth.\nAtheist and spiritual R*dditor Stephen Jay Gould put this in words in the modern era, calling science and religion &ldquo;non-overlapping magesteria,&rdquo; declaring in a laughable attempt at big-braned centrism that nothing in material reality is relevant to religion and nothing in religion is relevant to material reality.</p>\n<p>This is strange because people can research the philosophies I mentioned earlier, Platonism, Gnosticism, Stoicism, Hermeticism and can analyze and critique them and look at them as models of reality perfectly comparable to modern philosophical assumptions and approaches.\nBut we have been taught to view Christianity as this separate category, that can&rsquo;t possibly be a model of reality, but is a something merely &ldquo;moral&rdquo; or &ldquo;personal&rdquo; or &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; which are all terms that have been debased to mean nothing at all.</p>\n<p>A Christian believes that Jesus&rsquo;s resurrection was a true historical event, and a prelude of a general resurrection to come and that he established a Church and sacraments which are his vehicles for having man recover from sin within this life to prepare for his roles in the next.\nThe orthodox Christian Church is an unbroken chain since that period, and oft built on yet older philosophical and liturgical practices.</p>\n<p>If you find this alien or God unbelieveable, you can do yourself the favor of prayer and visit a priest and see what happens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"they-dont-even-believe-it\">They don&rsquo;t even believe it.</h3>\n<p>To contrast, pagans do not believe in pagan gods. Their brains are 100% modern and materialistic in mindset, and if they ironically say they believe in gods, it is out of some kind of Petersonian fake metaphorical &ldquo;belief&rdquo; in a concept or that &ldquo;Zeus&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a person, but is some kind of abstraction symbolizing the weather or something silly.\nThe only thing sillier is for them to claim that people in the ancient world <em>didn&rsquo;t really believe in them either</em>, but practiced entire religions meta-ironically for some social reasons.\nIf they believe in a &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; nature, it is not one beyond or above matter, but instead derived from it: it is psychological, hormonal, etc.</p>\n<p>Modern paganism is neither a tradition, nor a religion, nor even a belief.\nIt is just a new identity which supposedly flexes some kind of disposition to the world which is not even consistent across pagans because there is no basis for any of it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"real-baste-european-pagans\">Real Baste European Pagans</h3>\n<p>Christians, however, do believe in pagan gods.\nChristians have always admitted the reality of spiritual beings, including the demonic.\nYou can take the Michael Heiser/Divine Council pill on this if you&rsquo;re interested:\nWhile there is only one Creator and Supreme God, he created many among his heavenly host, and originally appointed them to the different races on earth.\nMany rebelled and set themselves up as specific gods of their appointed races.</p>\n<p>One of the purposes of Christ&rsquo;s coming was to vanquish these usurpers, and thus paganism/polytheism, which obviously has been successful.\n(Note that the <a href=\"https://lindypress.net/book?pk=6\">Book of Enoch</a> in Chapter 10 prophecies that these fallen angels would be judged 70 generations after the Enochian period, which cross-referencing with the Gospel of Luke, it is exactly 70 generations until Christ.)\nNow the issues of faith are not so much polytheism, but heresy and then atheism, which is a significant enough change in the cosmic dynamic.</p>", "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/christianity-based-paganism/", "date_published": "2022-07-29T11:53:20+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.bbc.com", "title": "Bristol Drag queen children's story hour disrupted by protests - BBC News", "description": "A demonstration against a drag queen story reading for children causes the Bristol event to be postponed.", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-62335147", "date_published": "2022-07-29T11:13:47.193167+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "Thomas Pain", "language": "en-GB", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://gabrielsieben.tech", "title": "Remote attestation is coming back.

Obviously the negative net worth early in life is kids losing around $10,000 a year in value by going to college, but the truly depressing thing is that after that period, their net worth increases only by an average of about $5,000 a year.</p>\n<p>That means they might have $5,000 more in the bank or $5,000 paid off of their student loans or $5,000 going to equity in a house, but no combination greater than that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-this-happen\">How does this happen?</h2>\n<p>How is it that people alive in the period of the highest and most productive technology are working more than Medieval serfs?</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s put it in simple terms by defining &ldquo;making it:&rdquo;</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Making it:</dt>\n<dd>Earning or having significantly more money than you spend or owe.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Or in pseudomath:</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">income - liabilities = comfortability</math></p>\n<p>To increase comfortablity, you can increase your income or decrease your liabilities.\nThis is a simple equation.</p>\n<p>By &ldquo;liabilities&rdquo; I mean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the cost of food you have to eat to live</li>\n<li>the cost of the place you need to live</li>\n<li>the payments for goods and services you actually need (power, or perhaps a car, etc.)</li>\n<li>debts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <em>problem</em> I would estimate is that people focus <strong>all of their time, money and interest on increasing their income and focus quite literally none on <em>decreasing</em> their liabilities</strong>, which is actually substantially easier anyway.</p>\n<p>In fact, the modern economy, including all the bad advice it gives to people can generally be thought of a system that is desperatly trying to <em>increase</em> everyone&rsquo;s liabilities within it.\nFinancial libabilities, debt and others, breed even more financial liabilities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-lifestory-of-basically-everyone-nowadays\">The Lifestory of Basically Everyone Nowadays</h3>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s illustrate this with the story of most people you know:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the best college I can because everyone told me to.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;I need to pay off my $40,000+ in student loans, so I need to move to the city and get a good job.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;I get paid well, so I need a better car and other stuff to match.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;I still have loan debt, car debt and now credit card debt, but now I have a good credit score, so I&rsquo;ll use all my savings to pay 20% of an expensive house I&rsquo;ll be paying off for 25 years.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Oh my boss wants me to humiliate myself for sodomy month or get the Coofid vaccine or the Mark of the Beast to keep my job. I have at least a quarter of a mil invested in my life here, so I can&rsquo;t just leave. Be realistic.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Yeah the economy is really bad and I lost a lot of investments. Either way, this is my career and what I&rsquo;m trained for. It&rsquo;d be hard to retrain. I made the right choices, I just got unlucky.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m 60 and it&rsquo;s time for retirement! Now that my body is broken I can start enjoying life!&rdquo;</li>\n<li><em>*Dies of seed-oil-induced heart attack.*</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It&rsquo;d be wrong to singularly blame student loans for all of this, but there is a tangible sense in which opening up any new massive monthly liability to the system encourages people to open up more to cover for it.</p>\n<p>No one is ever told that this is the inevitable end of increasing liabilities: you need more and more liabilities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"which-way-millennial\">&ldquo;Which way Millennial?&rdquo;</h3>\n<p>Millennials come in two financial categories: around 90% of them are extreme consoomers who cannot not spend every penny of their salaries on subscriptions, plastic toys and coffee and seem to view the fact they get calls from collections agencies as some unpreventable outcome of &ldquo;capitalism.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The other 10% are the exact opposite: they are contemplating living in the trunk of their 1990&rsquo;s Corolla parked in the parking lot of their job site so they can save 97% of their income.\nWhen they plan on buying a house or getting married, they are quixotically salivating on how much money they can save on monthly bills.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-endgame\">The Endgame</h2>\n<p>I will go ahead and say, I consider the ideal not even to be rich, but to not need money to live a comfortable life because you have put yourself in a geographic and behavioral position where you can survive on as little as possible.</p>\n<p>Either way, my mindset (as the second type of millennial) has always been &ldquo;How can I absolutely minimize the amount of money I need to live?&rdquo;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&ldquo;What is the cheapest place to rent?&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;What is the cheapest-per-calorie real food for me to eat?&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;What &ldquo;needs&rdquo; are not really needs and can I go without?&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The implicit goal was to live on as little as possible: that&rsquo;s what actually maximizes your life&rsquo;s freedom.\nIf you can live on less than, say, $500 a month, even working as a part-time wagie, you will be plenty to pay bills, save a significant amount and have lots of free time.</p>\n<p>For young single guys in computer science, this is especially ideal, since your hobbey/craft doesn&rsquo;t cost anything to tinker with.</p>\n<p>In my late twenties, right before I bought my house, I was living in a college town with a monthly budget <strong>including my rent</strong> of around $400 ($300 was rent $100 was basically groceries). Probably went over that $100 most months, but never by much. This is also when I started <a href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/making-free-money-off-credit-cards\">churning credit cards</a> to make a significant portion of my little expenditure back.</p>\n<h2 id=\"behavioral-patterns-over-life\">Behavioral Patterns over Life</h2>\n<p>As you&rsquo;re saving money to buy/pay off a permanent dwelling place, most important is cultivating permanent behaviors that will reduce your need for money and &ldquo;the system.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>If you take the &ldquo;high&rdquo;-income, high-liability route, you&rsquo;re going to be establishing wasteful antipatterns your early life and when you need to buckle down and root those out, it will be more difficult because it will be the egotistically trying task of going from showly and &ldquo;easy&rdquo; pleasure spending to a Spartan budget.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to have a solid foundation of low spending. I said in that video years ago on getting Trumpbux that all money you earn and spend should be directly weaponized to decrease your reliance on money. Property, tools, plants, skills. These are investments much more substantial than investing in boomer stocks because they lessen your need for money.</p>\n<h3 id=\"worst-case-scenario\">Worst Case Scenario</h3>\n<p>As a passing remark, I&rsquo;ll add that the other benefit of focusing on minimizing liabilities is that it makes you significantly less reliant on &ldquo;the system&rdquo; and more robust in the case of disaster.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Training&rdquo; to get a highly specific corporate job is not going to help you in all possible scenarios in the way that simple the simple craftsmanship of someone who fixes their own cars and things.</p>", "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/minimizing-liabilities-is-making-it/", "date_published": "2022-07-16T16:10:08+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://eli.thegreenplace.net", "title": "How I went about learning Rust - Eli Bendersky's website", "description": "", "link": "https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2022/how-i-went-about-learning-rust/", "date_published": "2022-07-16T09:12:52.097611+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "Thomas Pain", "language": ">long time now</a>,\nand about a year ago I finally began allocating some time every week to learning\nit.</p>\n<p>In this post I'll provide details on the learning path I've followed for Rust,\nin the hope that this may prove useful for others.

technological improvements we could make to improve our lives significantly.\nEven worse, in lieu of these simple and obvious solutions which have lain hidden in plain site for centuries, we have no doubt developed a lot of inefficient technology to fill in the gap.</p>\n<p>Since I was recently doing <a href=\"https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/w/oz4VV8SrnTEACCndxMASZH\">tutorials on Hugo</a>, a static site generator, it&rsquo;s funny to think that through the 90&rsquo;s, no one really thought to invent a computationally simple static-site generator as they exist now.\nPeople moved pretty much directly from manually edditing HTML files manually into massive proprietary WYSIWYG editors and web &ldquo;frameworks&rdquo; that regenerate web pages on every single visit.</p>\n<p>This lack of vision and inability to see the simpler solution has largely produced the slow-loading, content-minimal web of today and the bizarre culture of modern &ldquo;webdevs&rdquo; whose diets consist in anti-patterns.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-shame-of-bitcoin\">The shame of Bitcoin</h2>\n<p>Recently there was <a href=\"https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/w/7PZGdoF7WdpWVS1UDcwDFz\">an interview released of me</a> at Monerotopia with the Crypto Vigilate team.\nUnfortunately, the video cut off and doesn&rsquo;t have perhaps the best part which I now remember: our discussion on the possibility of &ldquo;obvious solutions&rdquo; that could conceivably replace proof-of-work in cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin, ultimately is a self-reinforcing behavioral Nash Equilibrium that uses the logic of proof-of-work mining to establish consensus while still remaining decentralized.\nThe thing is, anyone who is not a delusional fanboy has to look at proof-of-work as some kind of incredible weird and inefficient abomination.</p>\n<p>To establish decentralized consensus, we have to have an increasing farm of the world&rsquo;s computers performing computations that do essentially nothing outside of &ldquo;secure the network.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>There is no magic force in the universe that has ordained that the only possible way to establish decentralized consensus is Proof-of-Work.\nProof-of-stake is obviously an alternative to it, but one whose long-term game theoretic nature is still an issue of significant controversy.</p>\n<p>Regardless, an alien civilization observing us might view the issue of decentralized consensus similar to how we view the Inca who never thought to use wheels to make carts.\nIt will be pretty absurd if most of the world&rsquo;s computing power will soon be dedicated to proof-of-work mining only for some bratty kid or jaded cryptographer to come up with an &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; other way to establish a self-reinforcing system that can verify decentralized consensus that doesn&rsquo;t require the waste.</p>\n<h2 id=\"take-aways\">Take-aways</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Technological opportunities are not just everywhere, they are right in front of your face.</li>\n<li>The fact that a solution is obvious and simple is not reason for ruling it out because &ldquo;Someone must have thought of that and tried it before.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>Never be happy with technology that is inelegant just because there is no obvious alternative now.</li>\n</ol>", "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/obvious-technical-solutions/", "date_published": "2022-07-12T20:16:31+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.bloomberg.com", "title": "WeChat Is China\u2019s Most Beloved (and Feared) Surveillance Tool", "description": "WeChat Is China\u2019s Most Beloved (and Feared) Surveillance Tool", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-07-12/wechat-is-china-s-beloved-surveillance-tool?leadSource=uverify%20wall", "date_published": "2022-07-12T15:58:01+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "thumbnail": null, "tags": ["wechat", "china", "big tech", "surveillance", "privacy", "everything app", "big brother"], "vote": ["wechat", "china", "big tech", "surveillance", "privacy", "everything app", "big brother"]}, {"source": "https://petapixel.com", "title": "Photographer Documents All 12,795 Items That She Owns | PetaPixel", "description": "That's a lot of stuff.", "link": "https://petapixel.com/2022/07/08/photographer-documents-all-12795-items-that-she-owns/", "date_published": "2022-07-12T12:58:04.693691+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "Thomas Pain", "language": "en", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://webdevlaw.uk", "title": "Your compliance obligations under the UK\u2019s Online Safety Bill;

More and more countries are voicing their desire for digital sovereignty and techno-isolationism. \n\nExperts are worried this cyber-balkanization is creating a multi-verse of national Internets and corporate walled gardens that they refer to as the Splintertnet.\n\nIf Internet can be understood as a worldwide network of all networks, Splinternet would be the opposite of that. It is when nations stop participating in the ICANN consensus and begin assigning their own IP addresses. It is also when governments setup nationwide firewalls to restrict free flow of information to and from the country. Both of these trends are already well on their way to create the world\u2019s first Splinternet. \n\nSources\n[0] https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-computer-networking.html\n[1] https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/effect-2012-02-25-en\n[2] https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/what-2012-02-25-en\n[3] https://techonomy.com/welcome-to-the-splinternet/\n[4] https://www.economist.com/briefing/2010/09/02/a-virtual-counter-revolution\n[5] https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/03/17/1047352/russia-splinternet-risk/ \n[6] https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/03/tech/ukraine-russia-internet-icann/index.html\n[7] https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-10/russia-internet-isolation-accelerates-after-ukraine-invasion\n[8] https://fortune.com/2022/03/22/russia-war-ukraine-great-firewall-splinternet-internet/\n[9] https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-disconnected-global-internet-tests-rbc-daily-2021-07-22/ \n[10] https://www.reuters.com/article/amazon-cloud-idUSN1E7A727Q20111109\n[11] https://www.statista.com/topics/4418/amazon-web-services/\n[12] https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/ \n[13] https://about.facebook.com/meta \n[14] https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/27/technology/apple-screen-time-trackers.html\n[15] https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/\n[16] https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20907228/apple-quartz-app-store-china-removal-hong-kong-protests-censorship\n[17] https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/business/media/new-york-times-apps-apple-china.html?\n[18] https://www.reuters.com/business/oracle-says-it-has-suspended-all-operations-russia-2022-03-02/\n[19] https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russian-splinternet-014035581.html\n[20] https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/22/social-media-election-facebook-filter-bubbles\n[21] https://qz.com/1194566/google-is-finally-admitting-it-has-a-filter-bubble-problem/\n[22] https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/the-walls-are-closing-in-chinafinds-new-ways-to-tighten-internet-controls/2017/09/26/2e0d3562-9ee6-11e7-b2a7-bc70b6f98089_story.html\n[23] https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/the-splinternet-is-already-here/\n[24] https://www.ft.com/content/ba94c2bc-6e27-11ea-9bca-bf503995cd6f\nPeer-to-peer services\nBriar: https://briarproject.org/\nCwtch: https://cwtch.im/\n\nCredits\nMusic by: White Bat Audio https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteBatAudio\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6QwK9EpN5M", "date_published": "2022-05-13T10:48:15+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null, "tags": ["internet", "all time"]}, {"source": "https://medium.com", "title": "Why I Quit Google\u2019s WebAssembly Team, And How It Made Me Sick | by Katelyn Gadd | May, 2022 | Medium", "description": "I joined Google in early 2015 to work on the V8 team as one of the first authors of the WebAssembly specification.

In this video, he talks about some childhood memories while living in Philadelphia in the 1860s.  It was filmed on June 21, 1932.  This video has been colorized, speed-adjusted and restored with audio enhancements for clarity.\nNote: Thomson meant to say \"75 years ago\" rather than \"65 years ago\" in the beginning.  His family shipped over to America in 1857. \n\nOur new music channel - Life in the Music\n2-hour videos of music from the 1600s-1900s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24pSII56FIBAAI3FAu_ygw/featured\n\nElihu Thomson was born March 29, 1853, in Manchester, England. His father,\nwho worked as a mill mechanic, was thrown out of work in 1857 and decided to\nemigrate to the United States. In 1858 the family settled in Philadelphia,\nwhere Elihu grew up. His father's work as a mechanic stimulated Thomson's\ninterest in mechanical and chemical processes. From his early teens he read\nwidely, built models, and conducted simple chemical experiments. At\nPhiladelphia's Central High School Thomson was an outstanding student who\nattracted the interest of his instructors. Upon graduating in 1870 he was\noffered a teaching position at the school.\n\nBetween 1870 and 1880 Thomson taught high school in Philadelphia. At the same\ntime he and a fellow teacher named Edwin J. Houston experimented with\nelectricity and succeeded in building a practical electric arc lighting\nsystem. In 1879 a group of New England businessmen took an interest in\nthe Thomson-Houston arc lighting system and offered to finance its fabrication.\nIn 1880 Thomson moved to New Britain, Connecticut, as the company's chief\nengineer. By 1881 Thomson had designed the best arc lighting system in the\ncountry, but sales were slow. In 1882 a group of Lynn, Massachusetts,\nbusinessmen purchased the company and changed the name to the Thomson-Houston Electric Company.\n\nFor this video, I colorized it using AI optimization software, interpolated it to 60 frames/second, speed-adjusted it and refined it with De Blur, Sharpness and Stabilization.  For the audio, I remastered it using noise gate, compression, loudness normalization, EQ and a Limiter.  \n\nThis video is made for educational purposes for fair use under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oqbLSisnME", "date_published": "2022-03-19T00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/_oqbLSisnME/maxresdefault.webp", "tags": ["history", "documentary", "archive"]}, {"source": "https://www.theregister.com", "title": "Court says non-open 'open source' code is false advertising \u2022 The Register", "description": "Strap in for a wild ride of forks, trademarks, and licensing", "link": "https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/17/court_open_source/", "date_published": "2022-03-18T20:49:15.144273+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "Thomas Pain", "language": "en", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://blog.carlmjohnson.net", "title": "Even More Minor Features in Go 1.18 \u00b7 The Ethically-Trained Programmer", "description": "By popular demand, even more obscure features of Go", "link": "https://blog.carlmjohnson.net/post/2022/golang-118-even-more-minor-features/", "date_published": "2022-03-18T19:33:39+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "Thomas Pain", "language": "en", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.cnbc.com", "title": "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla received $24.3 million in total compensation for 2021", "description": "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla received $24.3 million in total compensation for 2021", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/18/pfizer-ceo-albert-bourla-received-24point3-million-in-total-compensation-for-2021.html", "date_published": "2022-03-18T18:28:27+00:00", "persistent": true, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "thumbnail": null, "tags": ["pfizer", "big pharma", "covid"]}, {"source": "https://www.ghacks.net", "title": "Each Firefox download has a unique identifier -

Project Veritas has obtained a separate report to the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, written by U.S. Marine Corp Major, Joseph Murphy, a former DARPA Fellow.\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe proposal does not mention or assess potential risks of Gain of Function (GoF) research,\u201d a direct quote from the DARPA rejection letter.\n\u2022 Project Veritas reached out to DARPA for comment regarding the hidden documents and spoke with the Chief of Communications, Jared Adams, who said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound normal to me,\u201d when asked about the way the documents were buried.\n\n[WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 Jan. 10, 2022] Project Veritas has obtained startling never-before-seen documents regarding the origins of COVID-19, gain of function research, vaccines, potential treatments which have been suppressed, and the government\u2019s effort to conceal all of this.\n\nThe documents in question stem from a report at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, better known as DARPA, which were hidden in a top secret shared drive.\n \nDARPA is an agency under the U.S. Department of Defense in charge of facilitating research in technology with potential military applications.\n \nProject Veritas has obtained a separate report to the Inspector General of the Department of Defense written by U.S. Marine Corp Major, Joseph Murphy, a former DARPA Fellow.\n\nThe report states that EcoHealth Alliance approached DARPA in March 2018, seeking funding to conduct gain of function research of bat borne coronaviruses. The proposal, named Project Defuse, was rejected by DARPA over safety concerns and the notion that it violates the basis gain of function research moratorium.\n \nAccording to the documents, NIAID, under the direction of Dr. Fauci, went ahead with the research in Wuhan, China and at several sites across the U.S.\n \nDr. Fauci has repeatedly maintained, under oath, that the NIH and NIAID have not been involved in gain of function research with the EcoHealth Alliance program. But according to the documents obtained by Project Veritas which outline why EcoHealth Alliance\u2019s proposal was rejected, DARPA certainly classified the research as gain of function. \n\n\u201cThe proposal does not mention or assess potential risks of Gain of Function (GoF) research,\u201d a direct quote from the DARPA rejection letter.\n\nMajor Murphy\u2019s report goes on to detail great concern over the COVID-19 gain of function program, the concealment of documents, the suppression of potential curatives, like Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine, and the mRNA vaccines.\n \nProject Veritas reached out to DARPA for comment regarding the hidden documents and spoke with the Chief of Communications, Jared Adams, who said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound normal to me,\u201d when asked about the way the documents were shrouded in secrecy. \u201cIf something resides in a classified setting, then it should be appropriately marked,\u201d Adams said. \u201cI\u2019m not at all familiar with unmarked documents that reside in a classified space, no.\u201d\n\nIn a video breaking this story published on Monday night, Project Veritas CEO, James O\u2019Keefe, asked a foundational question to DARPA:\n\n\u201cWho at DARPA made the decision to bury the original report? They could have raised red flags to the Pentagon, the White House, or Congress, which may have prevented this entire pandemic that has led to the deaths of 5.4 million people worldwide and caused much pain and suffering to many millions more.\u201d\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci has not yet responded to a request for comment on this story.\n\nAbout Project Veritas\nJames O'Keefe established Project Veritas in 2010 as a non-profit journalism enterprise to continue his undercover reporting work. Today, Project Veritas investigates and exposes corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions to achieve a more ethical and transparent society and to engage in litigation to: protect, defend and expand human and civil rights secured by law, specifically First Amendment rights including promoting the free exchange of ideas in a digital world; combat and defeat censorship of any ideology; promote truthful reporting; and defend freedom of speech and association issues including the right to anonymity.
