But you can clearly see a real person saying real words with his mouth.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Klaus Schwab : <br /><br />\u201cour education initiative\u2026 we have Cisco\u2026 and practically all the big names\u2026 we will revolutionize education\u2026we will retrain the teachers\u2026 we will put a new curriculum in place\u201d<br /><br />\u2026 so that we can indoctrinate the children with our ideology at an early age\u2026 <a href=\"https://t.co/PPSMIA1d5m\">pic.twitter.com/PPSMIA1d5m</a><br />\u2014 Wall Street Silver (@WallStreetSilv) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WallStreetSilv/status/1607929430164516864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Klaus Schwab, a global lobbyist, unelected to anything, has his hands in \"practically all the big\" corporations to retrain teachers and put a new global education curriculum in place. He doesn't say the word \"indoctrinate,\" but feel free to draw your own conclusions. Schwab's comments are so alarming that Elon Musk -- who for all the leftist attacks on billionaires, seems to be the only one NOT on their side -- was taken aback.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Uhh \u2026<br />\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1607933340023230468?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Now, it's very easy to go down the rabbit hole of conspiracies when you have the internet in front of you. And WEF associates give us plenty to work on. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/wef-engineering-gender-away\" target=\"_blank\">Engineering away gender</a>. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/farmers-dutch-regulations\" target=\"_blank\">Making it impossible for farmers to grow food</a>. And my personal favorite? The CEO of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pfizer-ceo-misinformation\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Biden's favorite pharmaceutical company</a> bragging about a pill with a computer chip that alerts authorities when you've taken it. Quote, \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pfizer-ceo-pill-computer-chip\" target=\"_blank\">imagine the compliance</a>.\"</p><p>Because it's so easy to go down that rabbit hole, it's important to take a step back and check yourself on occasion. So I ask you...is there anything about this video that doesn't make Klaus Schwab -- in a real video where this real man said real words -- sound like Cobra Commander hatching a plan for global domination? Because I can't think of anything right now.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

After three failed attempts at building a successful startup and spending time institutionalized, I'm giving up on my entrepreneurship dreams.<p>I tried everything - building an audience, making sure my product actually solved a problem, getting paying customers, and writing high-quality content and contributing to the community. But no matter what I did, I couldn't seem to get anywhere. My efforts were fruitless and I'm tired of trying. I barely had 20 followers, my substack and product blogs didn't get any signups, and while I did get a few upvotes (8) on Product Hunt once, I never had a paid customer. It was as if the world was against me and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't make any progress. I remember trying to interact and hype up my fellow indiehackers on Twitter, regularly engaging with their content, but no one ever paid any attention to me or followed me back. It was like I didn't even exist in the world of entrepreneurship. And even when I did get some attention, it was short-lived and never led to anything substantial.<p>But it's not just the lack of success that's getting me down. It's also the constant stream of digital nomad influencers on Twitter who sell extremely distorted, rosy, and often times false dreams to indie entrepreneurs like myself. They make it seem like building a successful startup is easy and anyone can do it with the right mindset and a few key tips. But the reality is that it's not that simple. It's fucking hard and it takes more than just a positive attitude to make it.<p>I know I'm not alone in feeling this way. There are so many other indie entrepreneurs out there who are struggling and feeling like they'll never make it. If you're one of them, I want you to know that you're not alone. It's okay to feel defeated and to want to give up. But please don't give up. Keep pushing forward and don't let the failures define you. There's always a chance for success, no matter how small it may seem.<p>But for me, I can't take it anymore. I've hit rock bottom and I have nothing left to give. To all the indie hackers, hacker news, and Reddit readers out there, please don't be fooled by the false promises of digital nomad influencers. Building a startup is hard work and it takes time. It's not as easy as they make it seem and it's not for everyone. Don't let your dreams consume you like they did for me, and PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PROTECT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH AT ALL COST! Don't make the same mistakes I did and realize that entrepreneurship may not be the path for you. It's okay to admit defeat and move on to something else.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

Since more than a decade I've been using an always-on VPN on all my devices through a VPS I operate (various cloud providers along the years).\nAlso for context, I stopped using all google services around 2015 or thereabouts - although I still have an account I no longer use it.\nThe only google service that I use rarely is google maps - of course, never logged on.\nAnd a few times a month I use google search for the odd obscure thing.<p>Around 2016 was the first time I noticed that google.com was showing at the bottom of the page my ZIP code. It felt very unusual but I was in the process of moving so I didn't pay too much attention. To my surprise, a few weeks later google.com was showing my new ZIP code.<p>I shopped around for cloud providers that would allow me to rotate the instance IP easily and thankfully there are many but I was curious how come google picked it up - the only plausible reason was using location data from the Google Maps iOS app.<p>Here's how you can replicate this.<p>Get a cheap VPS from a country different than yours. Get an iOS device (ideally an (older?) iPhone but I think it should work on an iPad) - Android devices should be excluded from this test for obvious reasons.\nReset it to factory defaults (optional but removes moving parts and false leads like cookies etc).<p>Install wireguard (or your preferred always-on vpn) and configure the VPS to be used as an exit node.\nInstall google maps (don't login of course) - can be used without being logged on just fine.\nInstall firefox focus (Safari in Private Window mode would work as well).<p>Confirm via ipinfo (or your preferred whatsmyip website) that you're using the VPS IP\nGo to google.com and confirm it's showing at the bottom of the page the country of the VPS (could also be shown in a different language if google has a presence in that country).<p>Use the google maps app a few times a day (ideally navigate from a place to another) - it will take about 2-3 weeks but you'll notice that google.com will now show your actual country for the VPS IP and also the google.com language will change to your own.<p>If you want to take it one step further, continue to use google maps on the iOS device. You'll notice that after a few more weeks, google.com will show your actual City (based on the IP) - and after a while longer it will be even more precise, will show your ZIP code.<p>You have to be patient though, it will take 2-4 weeks to start with - and it's imperative that that IP address is dedicated to this test.<p>Funny enough, I was on holiday on Mexico for a month right before reading the HN article I mentioned (have been using a VPS in the states for lower latency) and I noticed that after 2 weeks the language changed to Spanish and google.com was showing Mexico (I rotated the IP when this happened and it prompted me to write this 'Tell HN'.<p>Not surprisingly but Google doesn't share the new GeoIP data - MaxMind, ipinfo and others never changed their location data for that IP - they showed the original geoip even a few weeks after google changed theirs - haven't checked longer than that - it could be shared eventually.<p>In conclusion - I can't say that I'm surprised Google is using the Maps location data - and I don't think there's any way to prevent it (outside of not running Maps - but unfortunately it's one of the few ways of checking restaurant reviews).\nMy \"workaround\" is to periodically rotate my VPS IP and move on with life :)<p>Thanks for reading - I hope you found this useful.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34052786\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34052786</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "persistent": true, "language": "en-US", "user": null, "tags": ["privacy", "tracking", "google"]}, {"source": "http://www.msn.com/rss/news.aspx", "link": "http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/elon-musk-asked-his-twitter-followers-if-he-should-step-down-as-the-company-s-ceo-57-5-voted-yes/ar-AA15rBNV?li=BBnbcA1&srcref=rss", "title": "Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers if he should step down as the company's CEO. 57.5% voted 'yes.'", "date_published": "2022-12-19 11:51:04.032922+00:00", "description": "", "persistent": true, "language": "en-US", "user": null, "tags": []}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/19/in-2022-i-decided-to-get-away-from-screens-and-read-more-books-it-was-wonderful", "title": "In 2022, I decided to get away from screens and read more books.

In fact, you're being told two main lies: the first is how high inflation actually is. But the second is who is truly responsible for a large part of inflation happening.\n\nWhen we hear about inflation, we're told that it's primarily caused by the simple economics of money in the system. More money is printed, resulting in dollars becoming devalued, resulting in stuff getting more expensive. And yes, this is definitely a part of the inflation equation. However, there's a part that's often missed that in many cases, causes prices around us to rise as well.\n\nTo put it simply, it's all about corporate greed. And the desire of many companies to use inflation as a cover story for rising prices, so they can line their pockets.

You could opt out of targeted ads on Facebook or Instagram if you'd rather not have the social networks track your activity. You can already decline customized ads using data from third-party apps and sites.</p><p>The board's decision wouldn't directly force Meta to change. Rather, it would ask Ireland's Data Protection Commission to apply matching orders. As Meta's European operations are officially based in Ireland, the company would have to comply.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Both data boards acknowledged that there had been decisions, but didn't comment on what they entailed. We've asked Meta for comment. A spokesperson for the social media giant said it was \"too early to speculate,\" and that the EU might still offer legal backing for targeted ads. The company argued that it had \"fully\" engaged with the Data Protection Commission's inquiries.</p><p>If the EU does restrict Meta's personalization, it could have a significant impact on the company's bottom line. With fewer users willing to accept targeted ads, there may be fewer people clicking those ads and encouraging advertisers to spend more on campaigns. Meta was already worried about <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-ios-app-tracking-notices-192117307.html\">Apple's App Tracking Transparency</a>, and warned that it might cost $10 billion in sales when it launched in 2021. The reported European measure could also prove costly, especially as it would affect Android and the web.</p><p>The EU might not be very sympathetic, as its officials have penalized Meta more than once for purported privacy violations. It faced a $402 million fine in September over allegedly illegal <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-fined-405-million-euro-instagram-privacy-161348122.html\">child privacy settings on Instagram</a>, and just last month received a $277 million fine for supposedly inadequate <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-fined-265-million-euros-over-data-scraping-142937633.html\">safeguards against data scraping</a>. That's on top of an investigation into <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/eu-uk-probe-google-meta-ad-collusion-jedi-blue-113239217.html\">possible collusion with Google</a> on display ads.

CBDC stands for Central Bank Digital Currency, and is a new form of digital money that is on the horizon for just about every nation on Earth.\n\nCBDCs have already been launched fully in 11 countries, but are being tested in more than 100, including in nations that account for more than 95% of our planet's total GDP. In other words, if a CBDC hasn't hit your country yet, it very likely will soon. The criticism around CBDCs is that they will be used as the ultimate tool of surveillance and control, allowing governments to monitor citizens' every move. However, the United States and the Netherlands are already implementing laws to do just that, potentially requiring new reporting standards on almost all transactions.\n\nThe truth is, there may not be a lot we can do to stop a CBDC from arriving in our nations. But we can refuse to use one when they arrive, if they are as terrible for financial freedom as many believe.\n\nIn any case, I would love to hear your thoughts.

It\u2019s to construct  \"large packages\" of essential services, including communal canteens. Previously, we reported that the Chinese government has been expanding supply and distribution cooperatives throughout the country. These are all signs that the planned economy version 2.0 is starting up in China after the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party ended.   \nIt showed that the Communist Party at that time wanted not only to implement a system of full and unrestricted public ownership in order to control the political and economic life of the entire society but also to impose a communal lifestyle, forcing its way into the private sphere and controlling the decisions of individual life.\n\nHave questions?

Peterson and Dr. Yoram Hazony discuss the major problems plaguing today's youths, such as the resurgence of Marxism under the guise of woke morality, the creation of aimless social hierarchies that leave participants devoid of meaning, and the complete lack of respect for adverse thinking that has lead to the deterioration of our foundational principles.\n \nDr. Yoram Hazony is an Israeli author,  philosopher, political theorist, and Bible scholar. In 1994, Dr. Hazony founded the Shalem Center in Jerusalem, which became Shalem College in 2013. Being the first liberal arts college in Israel, it attracted widespread attention, followed by much acclaim as many of the country's renowned intellectuals joined its staff. Hazony has also served as director of the John Templeton Foundation's project in Jewish Philosophical Theology, as well as a member of the Israel Council for Higher Education committee. Dr. Hazony has published many books, his 2018 work, The Virtue of Nationalism, being awarded Conservative Book of the Year in 2019. He also maintains a regularly published blog, Jerusalem Letters, that explores the topics of philosophy, politics, Judaism, Israel, and higher education. Other writings by Dr. Hazony have been published in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and American Affairs.\n\n\u2014Links\u2014 \n\nFor Dr. Yoram Hazony:\n\nGet your copy of

Between late 2020 and early 2021, agency officials were in the \u201cadvanced\u201d stages of developing plans to brief FBI leadership on the software, according to internal bureau documents and court records seen by <em>The Times</em>. Those documents also reveal the bureau had developed guidelines for federal prosecutors detailing how the FBI\u2019s use of Pegasus would need to be disclosed during court cases.</p><p>Based on the documents, it\u2019s unclear if the FBI had considered using the spyware against American citizens. Earlier this year, <em>The Times </em>found that the agency had tested Phantom, a version of Pegasus that can target phones with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nso-group-spyware-us-state-department-report-183647765.html\"><ins>US numbers</ins></a>.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>By July 2021, the FBI eventually decided not to use Pegasus in criminal investigations.

A few months later, the US placed Pegasus creator NSO Group on the Commerce Department\u2019s entity list, a designation that prevents US companies from conducting business with the firm. Despite the decision not to use Pegasus, the FBI indicated it remains open to using spyware in the future.</p><p>\u201cJust because the FBI ultimately decided not to deploy the tool in support of criminal investigations does not mean it would not test, evaluate and potentially deploy other similar tools for gaining access to encrypted communications used by criminals,\u201d states a <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/nso-fbi-brief/f6199b0802b4fc01/full.pdf\"><ins>legal briefing</ins></a> filed by the FBI last month.</p><p>The documents appear to present a different picture of the agency\u2019s interest in Pegasus than the one FBI Director Chris Wray shared with Congress during a closed-doors hearing this past December. \u201cIf you mean have we used it in any of our investigations to collect or target somebody, the answer is - as I\u2019m assured - no,\u201d he <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/fbi-nso/58a69830f3cd2e7d/full.pdf\"><ins>said in response to a question from Senator Ron Wyden</ins></a>. \u201cThe reason why I hedge, and I want to be transparent, that we have acquired some of their tools for research and development.

That has in turn made it difficult to determine whether the tools are promoting racial profiling, while raising questions about accountability. \"Police forces are not necessarily answerable or held responsible for harms caused by facial recognition technology,\" said lead author Evani Radiya-Dixit.</p><p>The Met has claimed that the latest algorithms have improved LRF accuracy, with false alerts less than .08 percent, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/27/live-facial-recognition-police-study-uk\"><em>The Guardian</em></a>. They boasted of a 70 percent success rate up to 2020, but an expert from the University of Essex hired by the police force found it was actually just 19 percent.  \"That the court of appeal explicitly stated in 2020 that South Wales police use of this technology was 'unlawful' makes it difficult to argue this technology should be used,\" he said.</p><p>However, the Met said its work was supported by law. \"LFR is regulated by a number of sources of law.

The stock market value of Meta, the parent of Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/26/meta-earnings-report-facebook-stocks\">fell by $80bn on Thursday</a> after Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s company announced a 50% drop in third-quarter profits.

scam. One that is not only basically believed by the whole world, but one that is running our nations, and being bought and paid for by your tax dollars.\n\nYou've definitely heard of \"Net Zero\" before. It was first popularised during the Paris Climate Agreement in 2016, hosted by the United Nations. And while they likely have the best interests of our planet at heart, there are of course massive entities (especially the world's oil companies) who are taking advantage of Net Zero. Mostly, so they can make lots and lots of money.\n\nThe worst thing is, one of the solutions being heralded as our best choice for achieving these goals is carbon capture and storage. Which isn't basically doing anything at all. And is being use to make billions in extra dollars for oil companies.\n\nLet me know your thoughts below.\n\n0:00 - Why Net Zero\n1:02 - Where \"Net Zero\" actually came for\n2:16 - How oil companies lie about Net Zero\n3:38 - Carbon capture isn't what we were promised\n6:38 - Why oil companies really like CCS technology\n8:28 - Net Zero is just misdirection\n10:23 - Some final thoughts\n\n\u25ba IMPORTANT LINKS:\nEnter your email below for free weekly lessons and insights into becoming financially free, investing, global tax and corporate structures, passports, residencies, and more.\n\nhttps://www.abundantia.co/\n\n\u25ba SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u2022 Abundantia Instagram: @abundantia.co https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/\n\u2022 Sorelle's Instagram: @sorelleamore  https://instagram.com/sorelleamore\n\u2022 Leon's Instagram: @leonhill  https://instagram.com/leonhill\n\u2022 Abundantia Twitter: https://twitter.com/abundantiaco\n\u2022 Abundantia Facebook: http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance\n\nSorelle and Leon.\nFounders, Abundantia\n\nLiability Disclaimer: https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer\n*We may earn a commission if you buy any products or services via the links in this video's description.

This is how it's done. Support independent research and analysis by joining my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone \n\nThe Internet is a giant network of privately owned spaces open to public, where every participant knows the exact identity and location of one another and where corporate stalking is a perfectly legitimate business model. If you are not okay with automated decisions being made about your every move, you should consider creating an anonymous identity.\n\nAnonymity is the most powerful mitigation strategy on a publicly observable network such as the Internet. It is the most direct path towards privacy. This guide will tell you exactly what you need to know and do in order to create and maintain your very own anonymous identity. \n\nThe Internet is a privacy nightmare because every action is by default identifiable and linkable. That means actions always lead to a unique location and/or account on the network and actions can built a profile over time. Linkability and identifiability are your biggest privacy and anonymity threats on the Internet. For maximum anonymity, both of these threats need to be mitigated to the fullest extent possible. \n\nOur first step with any service will be to dissociate our account details from our personal information. The second step is to compartmentalize our anonymous identities so that they are isolated from our personal identities.\n\nDissociation and isolation of your anonymous identities are not the only steps to keep your anonymity. Be extremely cautious of what types of data you submit to these services while using them. Always think of the linkability and identifiability threats when using these accounts. \n\nPRIVACY THREAT MODELING\nhttps://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/ \nLINDDUN strategy for threat modeling\nhttps://www.linddun.org/post/keys-to-successful-privacy-threat-modeling\nhttps://www.linddun.org/linddun \nhttps://www.linddun.org/_files/ugd/cc602e_cf7e4c6b1d894bdaabc3094c48b26869.pdf \nhttps://www.linddun.org/go-getting-started \nLinkability\nhttps://www.linddun.org/linkability \nIdentifiability\nhttps://www.linddun.org/identifiability-1 \nMitigation strategies\nhttps://www.linddun.org/mitigation-strategies-and-solutions \n\nRECOMMENDED TOOLS\nKeepassXC\nhttps://keepassxc.org/ \nBitwarden\nhttps://bitwarden.com/ \nFIDO security keys\nhttps://fidoalliance.org/what-is-fido/ \nGrapheneOS\nhttps://grapheneos.org/\nOrbot\nhttps://orbot.app/ \nTor Browser\nhttps://www.torproject.org/ \nTutanota\nhttps://tutanota.com/ \nProtonMail\nhttps://proton.me/ \nBriar\nhttps://briarproject.org/\nOnionShare\nhttps://onionshare.org/\nWire\nhttps://wire.com/en/\nMatrix/Element\nhttps://element.io/\nHow to anonymously install applications\nhttps://www.privacyguides.org/android/#obtaining-applications \nAurora Open Source Software\nhttps://auroraoss.com/\nHow to obtain an anonymous burner phone - The Intercept\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4gqRYkA9KE \nHow to obtain an anonymous burner phone - The Hated One\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMJH-UJyENs\n\nNEWS SOURCES\nGoogle location tracking\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/states-file-new-suits-against-google-over-location-tracking-11643037890 \nChainalysis\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/04/chainalysis-estimates-2b-stolen-from-cross-chain-bridge-hacks-this-year/ \n\nCredits\nMusic by: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcavSftXHgxLBWwLDm_bNvA\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "persistent": true, "language": "en-US", "user": null, "tags": ["privacy", "tracking", "anonymity"]}, {"source": "https://www.wired.com", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/starlink-internet-dish-hack/", "title": "The Hacking of Starlink Terminals Has Begun | WIRED", "date_published": "2022-08-13 10:18:22.913665+00:00", "description": "It cost a researcher only $25 worth of parts to create a tool that allows custom code to run on the satellite dishes.", "persistent": true, "language": "en-US", "user": "Thomas Pain", "tags": []}, {"source": "https://www.fiod.nl", "link": "https://www.fiod.nl/arrest-of-suspected-developer-of-tornado-cash/", "title": "Arrest of suspected developer of Tornado Cash - FIOD", "date_published": "2022-08-13 09:47:01+00:00", "description": "On Wednesday 10 August, the FIOD arrested a 29-year-old man in Amsterdam.

I will frame it as a response to an email I received within the past day or so:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hey Luke,</p>\n<p>First off, I would like to thank you for all your efforts in making everything\nyou know accessible to everyone. You have exposed me to some of the most\nthought-provoking people on the internet and Varg is one of them. I was\nwondering if you can write an article or make a video on what you think about\nVarg&rsquo;s Paganism in relation to you choosing Orthodox Christianity. I know that\nyou briefly talked about it in one of your livestreams, however, I would like\nto better understand why you don&rsquo;t practice Paganism yourself. My background is\nSerbian and most Serbians follow the Serbian Orthodox Church, but after\nwatching Varg&rsquo;s videos, I&rsquo;m conflicted. I agree with a lot of what Varg says\nabout Christianity, but my father long ago told me to follow the Serbian\nOrthodox Church if I were to become religious. I&rsquo;m sure that many people feel\nthe same way after watching Varg&rsquo;s videos, and your thoughts on it would\ngreatly help people like me make up their minds.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p><em>redacted</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I will sum up my answer to this email in bullet points, then explain what I mean.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modern &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; is not a real thing and has nothing to do with paganism in history.</li>\n<li>The most direct cultural link between modern man and antiquity is the orthodox Christian Church.</li>\n<li>Truth matters&mdash;&ldquo;Picking&rdquo; a religion on personal preferences is brain-dead and self-refuting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"your-average-pagan\">Your Average Pagan</h2>\n<p>Many people probably don&rsquo;t know who Varg Vikernes is, but since the email brings him up, I will talk about him as an example of where paganism leads.\nModern &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; is not an authentic tradition handed down over the ages.\nIt is an attempt of modern disconnected people to recreate or re-engineer a culture, time and place they have absolutely no contact with.\nThis ultimately makes &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; a modernist Rorschach test where individuals can more-or-less create the religion they want.</p>\n<h3 id=\"paganism-with-modern-goggles\">Paganism with modern goggles</h3>\n<p>Varg&rsquo;s particular &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; is a kind of scientific euhemerism: he doesn&rsquo;t actually believe in gods in the way an ancient pagan would have, but that the concepts of the gods represent scientific or other knowledge.\n(This is where the placenta meme around him comes from after all, when he and his wife related assorted pagan myths and items to the tree-like appearance of a human placenta.)\nHe has also reduced classical abstract spiritual concepts into hormones and other related things.\nIn essence, he has created a pseudo-paganism that is compatible with modern materialism.</p>\n<p>Varg had cited and recommended works such as Frazer&rsquo;s <em>Golden Bough</em> as influential on his thought which is of a similar vein.\nThis book was part of a wider movement in the English-speaking rationalist world to rationalize and explain myth.\nIt goes without saying that I think this all comes from the assumption of modern man that all ancient people underlyingly thought like Neil deGrasse Tyson.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-long-until-legend-becomes-myth\">How long until legend becomes myth?</h3>\n<p>More plausible is the viewpoint I&rsquo;ve spoken of in works such as <a href=\"https://notrelated.xyz/#02.04\"><em>Hamlet&rsquo;s Mill</em></a>.\nIt alleges that <em>one specific</em> prehistoric civilization used myth to transmit scientific knowledge, but being thousands of years out from that civilization, the descendant stories are distorted, partial and can only be related after extensive study.\nThey allege that &ldquo;Hamlet stories&rdquo; are similar in origin and actually carry astrological information, including the idea of the procession of the equinoxes.</p>\n<p>But Varg&rsquo;s quasi-euhemerism makes a much stronger claim, that all our &ldquo;forebears&rdquo; (as he tends to call them) left an entire encyclopedia of scientific knowledge in stories that have remained unblemished and mostly unchanged over thousands or <em>millions</em> of years since the Neanderthals, who he views as the Trve Europeans.</p>\n<p>This stronger claim should be absurd on its face, as it assumes that over the millennia, there is little to no addition, subtraction or change of folklore.\nThe <em>Hamlet&rsquo;s Mill</em> model admits that this does happen, but Varg is dealing with a much longer scale and often makes very specific claims about some myths.\nWhat I think Varg is truly doing when he looks at a pagan myth and sees a placenta, he is seeing statistical noise and fitting that noise to the many possibilities in his head.\n(I will also say that this is somewhat the modus operandi of many capital-T &ldquo;Traditionalists&rdquo; in the vein of Evola or Gu\u00e9non.)</p>\n<aside>\nThis is principally a response to the theories that Varg put forth around 2016-2018 when I would occasionally watch his videos. I'm sure it's very possible that he endorses things very different now, since this \"paganism\" is not anything concrete.\n</aside>\n<h2 id=\"is-christianity-a-departure-from-european-tradition\">Is Christianity a departure from European tradition?</h2>\n<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve tried to emphasize <a href=\"https://notrelated.xyz/#02.02\">in some places</a> is the general wrongness of the idea of the cultural &ldquo;quantum leap&rdquo; or &ldquo;discontinuity&rdquo; between Prechristian and Christian Europe.\nThis is a highly important issue for many putative pagans, because they view the &ldquo;change&rdquo; of Europe over to Christianity as perhaps the start of the now constant and perpetual leftist cultural revolution.</p>\n<p>This is the idea, which most people and &ldquo;based&rdquo; pagans have even by osmosis, that the Christianization of Europe was a radical break from history and tradition.</p>\n<p>This is true only on the Christian metric: obviously the salvation of Europe is a quantum leap.\nHowever, melodramatic pagans will lament that this is when Europe have up its &ldquo;European&rdquo; soul and adopted a &ldquo;Jewish&rdquo; or &ldquo;desert&rdquo; religion which put the continent on a totally different and out-of-touch cultural direction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pagan-philosophy-and-christianity\">Pagan Philosophy and Christianity</h3>\n<p>Christian theology, including Trinitarian theology has direct and undeniable &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; analogues and imitators:\nNeoplatonism expresses a kind of theological trinity as well (the One, the Intellect and the Soul), albeit one more similar to Origen&rsquo;s trinity where a hierarchy of the three persons exist.</p>\n<p>In the cosmogony of the <em>Poemandres</em>, a Hermetic work, shows a pagan creation myth wherein God creates the world via his <em>Logos</em>, as in the first chapter of St. John&rsquo;s gospel, which also has a trinitarian and monotheistic unity with God (differing from Christianity in its panentheism).</p>\n<p>As I mentioned in the linked podcast <a href=\"https://notrelated.xyz/#02.02\">episode above</a>, Stoic philosophy is a component needed to understand the opening of the gospel of John and is part of the philosophical backdrop of early Christian theology.</p>\n<p>Medieval esoteric doctrines and alchemy viewed all of nature as trinitarian, possessing body, mind, and spirit (salt, sulfur and mercury), which was related directly to the Triune nature of God.\nEven specific mystical sects like Mithraism or the many forms of Gnosticism are tied closely to the development of Christianity.</p>\n<p>All of these intellectual strands were intertwined with Christianity since the beginning of the written expression of Christian theology.</p>\n<p>A pagan now has to ask himself: if Hermeticism or Mithraism had taken over as a universal religion of Europe, would they loathe it like they loathe Christianity and view it as a radical departure from &ldquo;paganism?&rdquo;\nNote that Hermeticism had an alleged Egyptian origin, and Mithraism had a orientalist/Iranic origin.</p>\n<p>Note that none of my point here is specifically that Christianity influenced or created these other philosophies or that they influenced (providentially) Christianity.\nWhat is important is that looking at it dispassionately, we cannot deem Christianity as some cultural departure from &ldquo;real&rdquo; European culture without also throwing out this entire philosophical tradition as a whole.</p>\n<p>Medieval Christians would often look at Greek Philosophy as another covenant of God established to prepare mankind intellectually for the revelation of the Trinity.\n(Note also that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCjX0il3wkc\">Dante and others</a> represent Christians who viewed the Roman Empire also as part of a divine plan.)</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the Christian religion is non-cultural and thus universal/catholic. There are cultural aspects associated with it, but there&rsquo;s a difference between essence and accidents.\nOf those cultural aspects, they are nearly all European, not, as some allege, Hebrew or Jewish.\nMost of the New Testament is quite literally an explication of why this religion which accepts the Hebrew Scriptures is markedly non-Jewish and why Jewish practices like circumcision and sacrifice are sacrilegious.</p>\n<p>So the view we should get from this is that Christianization was no cultural leap into an alien worldview, but something whose intellectual side happened slowly over centuries and would only be viewed as spiritual, not culturally distinct from its environment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"which-change-is-good\">Which change is good?</h3>\n<p>Note that even Varg admits that religious interpretation and practice changes with the centuries.\nIn his interpretation and even in his RPG, MYFAROG (which is really just an expression of his paganism and worldview), characters can have one of two &ldquo;Life Stances&rdquo; or religious inclinations: <em>Sei\u00f0r</em> or  <em>\u00c2satr\u00fb</em>.\nSei\u00f0r &ldquo;tradition,&rdquo; represents a kind of animism, witchcraft or spell-casting, while \u00c2satr\u00fb represents the worship of pagan gods.\nCharacters can choose either life stance, but one can only change from Sei\u00f0r to \u00c2satr\u00fb, which is a representation of the alleged historical shift in early history from animistic to polytheistic practices.</p>\n<p>If we accept this cultural transition as &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; in terms of cultural continuity, on what grounds could we also mark as verboten a shift from polytheism to monotheism?\nAfter all, the pagan philosophy of Plato and Aristotle even from the earliest was monotheistic at its core, and even today, the world&rsquo;s one remaining &ldquo;polytheistic&rdquo; religion, Hinduism only appears so on the surface, but has at its core its own monad and final cause: Brahman.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tradition-vs-inventing-your-own-religion\">Tradition vs. Inventing your own religion</h2>\n<p>To learn of Christian theology, thus, is to set oneself down a road of millennia of learning with often with no delineation between Christian and Prechristian thought.\nBy the same token, learning of secular philosophy, even as an atheist might lead you to Christianity, as was the case with me.\nThere is no obvious discontinuity, either in thought or practice.</p>\n<p>But modern day &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; does indeed have such a gap.\nTo be a &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; does not involve communing with a centuries-old tradition passed down generation-to-generation from antiquity.</p>\n<p>It is modern people imagining based on T.V. shows, books and their own creativity what Prechristian Europe was like and then putting on their own imitation of it.\nThey might see something they dislike in the world, blame it on Christians and then imagine a world without it.\nThis invariably comes with retrojecting their own modern values and assumptions on the past.</p>\n<p>After all, we Christians can sit down with an Orthodox Priest or grow up in a Orthodox household and have a direct, personal contact with a tradition and understand how people who are part of it think and act.\nWe have no tangible contact with Prechristian European paganism, even out of intellectual interest.\nUnderstanding how Europeans truly thought and acted is an issue of cultural reconstruction and theory.\nTraditional folklore and practices are still very much alive, but they are now decked in a Christian garb.\nWe do celebrate Christmas for Our Lord&rsquo;s birth, but everyone knows that nearly all of the practices of that season of the many nations of Europe predate Christianization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-worst-possible-decision\">The Worst Possible Decision.</h3>\n<p>All this said, the absolute worst self-own possible would be someone who has direct and easy access to the Orthodox Church and abandons it or leaves it for a false &ldquo;religion&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t even exist off of the internet and has no organic connection to reality, like Neo-Paganism.</p>\n<p>So my recommendation to the emailer above should be obvious.</p>\n<p>Being physically close to the Orthodox Church is a huge asset, but even being able to travel to one occasionally is a massive grace. Everyone should be taking advantage of that as often as possible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pagan-gurus\">Pagan Gurus</h3>\n<p>Because it is ungrounded and ahistorical, modern &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; thus naturally exists as a kind of extreme Protestant guru-centered feel-goodery where since there is absolutely no tether to a genuine preserved tradition, a man can make up an unfalsifiable claim about what true &ldquo;Paganism&rdquo; is and sell it as legit.</p>\n<p>I mentioned Varg earlier, who has concocted a &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; that consists in claiming that their lore and practice embed scientific information.\nHe doesn&rsquo;t <em>believe</em> in pagan gods, unless we&rsquo;re talking about belief in a very evasive and meaningless Jordan Peterson kind of way.\nIf we could actually transport a prehistoric pagan to our day and speak to him, he would probably either be confused or bemused by this very modern worldview, but we can&rsquo;t even do this.</p>\n<p>Most pagans are not &ldquo;based&rdquo; like Varg anyway (he lives a minimalist and traditional lifestyle in rural France with an ever-growing family).\nMost &ldquo;pagans&rdquo; are leftists who like &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; because they hate God and nature and morality and imagine that pagans were demented sexual perverts like they are.</p>\n<h2 id=\"truth\">Truth</h2>\n<p>Notice that I had specifically avoided the most important issue: Truth.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve done this because when people are asking to convert to something just because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;based,&rdquo; <em>Truth</em> is unfortunately not necessarily their concern, so I&rsquo;ve first addressed issues that do concern them.</p>\n<p>The reality is, thankfully, that truth is the most &ldquo;based&rdquo; thing of all&mdash;And it is entirely cringe to believe in something because it sounds cool to you.\nIf you think you can decide your own truth, you are no different from someone who thinks they can decide their own pronouns, literally.</p>\n<p>Even in the email above, he refers to me &ldquo;choosing&rdquo; orthodox Christianity as if it were an issue of personal taste.\nIf I liked pop music and people rolling on the ground, perhaps I would be just as justified converting to some Pentecostal sect.\nThis is silly.</p>\n<p>The greatest deception is that religion is this separate category about &ldquo;feelings&rdquo; or &ldquo;preference&rdquo; and not truth.\nAtheist and spiritual R*dditor Stephen Jay Gould put this in words in the modern era, calling science and religion &ldquo;non-overlapping magesteria,&rdquo; declaring in a laughable attempt at big-braned centrism that nothing in material reality is relevant to religion and nothing in religion is relevant to material reality.</p>\n<p>This is strange because people can research the philosophies I mentioned earlier, Platonism, Gnosticism, Stoicism, Hermeticism and can analyze and critique them and look at them as models of reality perfectly comparable to modern philosophical assumptions and approaches.\nBut we have been taught to view Christianity as this separate category, that can&rsquo;t possibly be a model of reality, but is a something merely &ldquo;moral&rdquo; or &ldquo;personal&rdquo; or &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; which are all terms that have been debased to mean nothing at all.</p>\n<p>A Christian believes that Jesus&rsquo;s resurrection was a true historical event, and a prelude of a general resurrection to come and that he established a Church and sacraments which are his vehicles for having man recover from sin within this life to prepare for his roles in the next.\nThe orthodox Christian Church is an unbroken chain since that period, and oft built on yet older philosophical and liturgical practices.</p>\n<p>If you find this alien or God unbelieveable, you can do yourself the favor of prayer and visit a priest and see what happens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"they-dont-even-believe-it\">They don&rsquo;t even believe it.</h3>\n<p>To contrast, pagans do not believe in pagan gods.

I have at least a quarter of a mil invested in my life here, so I can&rsquo;t just leave. Be realistic.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Yeah the economy is really bad and I lost a lot of investments. Either way, this is my career and what I&rsquo;m trained for. It&rsquo;d be hard to retrain.

Now that my body is broken I can start enjoying life!&rdquo;</li>\n<li><em>*Dies of seed-oil-induced heart attack.*</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It&rsquo;d be wrong to singularly blame student loans for all of this, but there is a tangible sense in which opening up any new massive monthly liability to the system encourages people to open up more to cover for it.</p>\n<p>No one is ever told that this is the inevitable end of increasing liabilities: you need more and more liabilities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"which-way-millennial\">&ldquo;Which way Millennial?&rdquo;</h3>\n<p>Millennials come in two financial categories: around 90% of them are extreme consoomers who cannot not spend every penny of their salaries on subscriptions, plastic toys and coffee and seem to view the fact they get calls from collections agencies as some unpreventable outcome of &ldquo;capitalism.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The other 10% are the exact opposite: they are contemplating living in the trunk of their 1990&rsquo;s Corolla parked in the parking lot of their job site so they can save 97% of their income.\nWhen they plan on buying a house or getting married, they are quixotically salivating on how much money they can save on monthly bills.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-endgame\">The Endgame</h2>\n<p>I will go ahead and say, I consider the ideal not even to be rich, but to not need money to live a comfortable life because you have put yourself in a geographic and behavioral position where you can survive on as little as possible.</p>\n<p>Either way, my mindset (as the second type of millennial) has always been &ldquo;How can I absolutely minimize the amount of money I need to live?&rdquo;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&ldquo;What is the cheapest place to rent?&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;What is the cheapest-per-calorie real food for me to eat?&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;What &ldquo;needs&rdquo; are not really needs and can I go without?&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The implicit goal was to live on as little as possible: that&rsquo;s what actually maximizes your life&rsquo;s freedom.\nIf you can live on less than, say, $500 a month, even working as a part-time wagie, you will be plenty to pay bills, save a significant amount and have lots of free time.</p>\n<p>For young single guys in computer science, this is especially ideal, since your hobbey/craft doesn&rsquo;t cost anything to tinker with.</p>\n<p>In my late twenties, right before I bought my house, I was living in a college town with a monthly budget <strong>including my rent</strong> of around $400 ($300 was rent $100 was basically groceries). Probably went over that $100 most months, but never by much. This is also when I started <a href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/making-free-money-off-credit-cards\">churning credit cards</a> to make a significant portion of my little expenditure back.</p>\n<h2 id=\"behavioral-patterns-over-life\">Behavioral Patterns over Life</h2>\n<p>As you&rsquo;re saving money to buy/pay off a permanent dwelling place, most important is cultivating permanent behaviors that will reduce your need for money and &ldquo;the system.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>If you take the &ldquo;high&rdquo;-income, high-liability route, you&rsquo;re going to be establishing wasteful antipatterns your early life and when you need to buckle down and root those out, it will be more difficult because it will be the egotistically trying task of going from showly and &ldquo;easy&rdquo; pleasure spending to a Spartan budget.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to have a solid foundation of low spending. I said in that video years ago on getting Trumpbux that all money you earn and spend should be directly weaponized to decrease your reliance on money. Property, tools, plants, skills. These are investments much more substantial than investing in boomer stocks because they lessen your need for money.</p>\n<h3 id=\"worst-case-scenario\">Worst Case Scenario</h3>\n<p>As a passing remark, I&rsquo;ll add that the other benefit of focusing on minimizing liabilities is that it makes you significantly less reliant on &ldquo;the system&rdquo; and more robust in the case of disaster.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Training&rdquo; to get a highly specific corporate job is not going to help you in all possible scenarios in the way that simple the simple craftsmanship of someone who fixes their own cars and things.</p>", "persistent": true, "language": "en-US", "user": null, "tags": []}, {"source": "https://eli.thegreenplace.net", "link": "https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2022/how-i-went-about-learning-rust/", "title": "How I went about learning Rust - Eli Bendersky's website", "date_published": "2022-07-16 09:12:52.097611+00:00", "description": "", "persistent": true, "language": ">long time now</a>,\nand about a year ago I finally began allocating some time every week to learning\nit.</p>\n<p>In this post I'll provide details on the learning path I've followed for Rust,\nin the hope that this may prove useful for others.

technological improvements we could make to improve our lives significantly.\nEven worse, in lieu of these simple and obvious solutions which have lain hidden in plain site for centuries, we have no doubt developed a lot of inefficient technology to fill in the gap.</p>\n<p>Since I was recently doing <a href=\"https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/w/oz4VV8SrnTEACCndxMASZH\">tutorials on Hugo</a>, a static site generator, it&rsquo;s funny to think that through the 90&rsquo;s, no one really thought to invent a computationally simple static-site generator as they exist now.\nPeople moved pretty much directly from manually edditing HTML files manually into massive proprietary WYSIWYG editors and web &ldquo;frameworks&rdquo; that regenerate web pages on every single visit.</p>\n<p>This lack of vision and inability to see the simpler solution has largely produced the slow-loading, content-minimal web of today and the bizarre culture of modern &ldquo;webdevs&rdquo;

that could conceivably replace proof-of-work in cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin, ultimately is a self-reinforcing behavioral Nash Equilibrium that uses the logic of proof-of-work mining to establish consensus while still remaining decentralized.\nThe thing is, anyone who is not a delusional fanboy has to look at proof-of-work as some kind of incredible weird and inefficient abomination.</p>\n<p>To establish decentralized consensus, we have to have an increasing farm of the world&rsquo;s computers performing computations that do essentially nothing outside of &ldquo;secure the network.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>There is no magic force in the universe that has ordained that the only possible way to establish decentralized consensus is Proof-of-Work.\nProof-of-stake is obviously an alternative to it, but one whose long-term game theoretic nature is still an issue of significant controversy.</p>\n<p>Regardless, an alien civilization observing us might view the issue of decentralized consensus similar to how we view the Inca who never thought to use wheels to make carts.\nIt will be pretty absurd if most of the world&rsquo;s computing power will soon be dedicated to proof-of-work mining only for some bratty kid or jaded cryptographer to come up with an &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; other way to establish a self-reinforcing system that can verify decentralized consensus that doesn&rsquo;t require the waste.</p>\n<h2 id=\"take-aways\">Take-aways</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Technological opportunities are not just everywhere, they are right in front of your face.</li>\n<li>The fact that a solution is obvious and simple is not reason for ruling it out because &ldquo;Someone must have thought of that and tried it before.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>Never be happy with technology that is inelegant just because there is no obvious alternative now.</li>\n</ol>", "persistent": true, "language": "en-US", "user": null, "tags": []}, {"source": "https://petapixel.com", "link": "https://petapixel.com/2022/07/08/photographer-documents-all-12795-items-that-she-owns/", "title": "Photographer Documents All 12,795 Items That She Owns | PetaPixel", "date_published": "2022-07-12 12:58:04.693691+00:00", "description": "That's a lot of stuff.", "persistent": true, "language": "en", "user": "Thomas Pain", "tags": []}, {"source": "https://webdevlaw.uk", "link": "https://webdevlaw.uk/2022/07/11/your-compliance-obligations-under-the-uks-online-safety-bill/", "title": "Your compliance obligations under the UK\u2019s Online Safety Bill;

To protect my IP address, I use Orbot to route my traffic through Tor. \n\nSources\n[1a]

More and more countries are voicing their desire for digital sovereignty and techno-isolationism. \n\nExperts are worried this cyber-balkanization is creating a multi-verse of national Internets and corporate walled gardens that they refer to as the Splintertnet.\n\nIf Internet can be understood as a worldwide network of all networks, Splinternet would be the opposite of that. It is when nations stop participating in the ICANN consensus and begin assigning their own IP addresses. It is also when governments setup nationwide firewalls to restrict free flow of information to and from the country. Both of these trends are already well on their way to create the world\u2019s first Splinternet. \n\nSources\n[0] https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-computer-networking.html\n[1] https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/effect-2012-02-25-en\n[2] https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/what-2012-02-25-en\n[3] https://techonomy.com/welcome-to-the-splinternet/\n[4] https://www.economist.com/briefing/2010/09/02/a-virtual-counter-revolution\n[5] https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/03/17/1047352/russia-splinternet-risk/ \n[6] https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/03/tech/ukraine-russia-internet-icann/index.html\n[7] https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-10/russia-internet-isolation-accelerates-after-ukraine-invasion\n[8] https://fortune.com/2022/03/22/russia-war-ukraine-great-firewall-splinternet-internet/\n[9] https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-disconnected-global-internet-tests-rbc-daily-2021-07-22/ \n[10] https://www.reuters.com/article/amazon-cloud-idUSN1E7A727Q20111109\n[11] https://www.statista.com/topics/4418/amazon-web-services/\n[12] https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/ \n[13] https://about.facebook.com/meta \n[14] https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/27/technology/apple-screen-time-trackers.html\n[15] https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/\n[16] https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20907228/apple-quartz-app-store-china-removal-hong-kong-protests-censorship\n[17] https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/business/media/new-york-times-apps-apple-china.html?\n[18] https://www.reuters.com/business/oracle-says-it-has-suspended-all-operations-russia-2022-03-02/\n[19] https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russian-splinternet-014035581.html\n[20] https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/22/social-media-election-facebook-filter-bubbles\n[21] https://qz.com/1194566/google-is-finally-admitting-it-has-a-filter-bubble-problem/\n[22] https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/the-walls-are-closing-in-chinafinds-new-ways-to-tighten-internet-controls/2017/09/26/2e0d3562-9ee6-11e7-b2a7-bc70b6f98089_story.html\n[23] https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/the-splinternet-is-already-here/\n[24] https://www.ft.com/content/ba94c2bc-6e27-11ea-9bca-bf503995cd6f\nPeer-to-peer services\nBriar: https://briarproject.org/\nCwtch: https://cwtch.im/\n\nCredits\nMusic by: White Bat Audio https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteBatAudio\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "persistent": true, "language": "en-US", "user": null, "tags": ["internet", "all time"]}, {"source": "https://medium.com", "link": "https://medium.com/@katelyngadd/why-i-quit-googles-webassembly-team-and-how-it-made-me-sick-c50ef562ce1", "title": "Why I Quit Google\u2019s WebAssembly Team, And How It Made Me Sick | by Katelyn Gadd | May, 2022 | Medium", "date_published": "2022-05-12 16:38:25.093981+00:00", "description": "I joined Google in early 2015 to work on the V8 team as one of the first authors of the WebAssembly specification.
