Surveillance technologies that go beyond anything remotely imagined by sci-fi scenarios and dystopian fantasies. It is currently the primary focus of research funded by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activty (IARPA) \u2013 a US government body.\n\nIARPA aims to develop the ultimate surveillance tool \u2013 one that can combine all key biometric markers into one comprehensive surveillance AI. The research is lead by a team at the Michigan State University and the tool they are creating is called FarSight.\n\nFarSight combines three biometric markers \u2013 gait, body and face \u2013 into a traceable profile to be matched to known individuals or to identify new matches.
