Is she really an insult to Scooby-Doo fans? | Arwa Mahdawi]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Leftwingers, rightwingers: Mindy Kaling’s new TV show has outraged them all. She’d have gotten away with it, if it wasn’t for those meddling viewers</p><p>We live in a hyperpartisan world where nobody can agree on anything. And yet, every now and again something comes along that bridges political differences and brings people together. This latest unifier appears to be a Scooby-Doo spin-off, Velma, which is targeted at adults. Whatever their political persuasion, everyone seems to hate it. (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/12/velma-review-mindy-kaling-scooby-doo">Except, rather weirdly, the Guardian</a>, which gave it four out of five stars.) The cartoon premiered last week to <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/mindy-kalings-scooby-doo-spinoff-222804326.html">mostly abysmal reviews.</a> Things are so dire that there are even <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/01/14/velma-is-so-bad-its-spawned-psyop-conspiracy-theories/?sh=12a1ce1912e2">conspiracy theories</a> swirling that Mindy Kaling, its star and an executive producer of the show, made Velma terrible on purpose in order to make the left look bad.</p><p>Why would Kaling do something like that? I have no idea. My understanding is that she probably didn’t and that people are just getting angry online because people like getting angry online. The left appears to be angry at Kaling because she once liked a tweet by JK Rowling, which supposedly means she is an irredeemable <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=kaling%20trans&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">transphobe</a> who should be cancelled immediately. The right, meanwhile, doesn’t seem to like the fact that Velma is a lesbian in the show and Kaling is a brown woman. One rightwing comedian called it “<a href="https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/comment/scooby-doo-spin-velma-isnt-28950816">openly racist against white people</a>”. Other people are saying the series is “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/adult-scooby-doo-reboot-velma-ripped-critics-audiences-where-everything-horribly-wrong">insulting to the Scooby-Doo fanbase</a>”. The series really touches pretty much every aspect of the culture wars.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/18/velma-lesbian-detective-scooby-doo-fans-hate">Continue reading...</a>]]</description><pubDate>2023-01-18 07:00:38+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/18/velma-lesbian-detective-scooby-doo-fans-hate</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/18/velma-lesbian-detective-scooby-doo-fans-hate</guid>

<p>In a defense brief filed to the US Supreme Court this week, Google warned that altering Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — which protects internet-based companies from being sued for content created by their users — would "upend the internet."</p><p>The brief was filed as part of Google's defense in a lawsuit brought by the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old US citizen who was killed by ISIS in Paris in November 2015. Oral arguments for the case are set to be heard on February 21.</p><p>The family argues that Google-owned YouTube violated the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) when its algorithms recommended ISIS-related content to users. They argue that even if the company is not liable for the ISIS content, the algorithmic recommendations should not be protected by Section 230.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3685535/google-warns-court-against-changing-liability-shield-for-internet-companies.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]</description><pubDate>2023-01-13 21:16:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.computerworld.com/article/3685535/google-warns-court-against-changing-liability-shield-for-internet-companies.html#tk.rss_all</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.computerworld.com/article/3685535/google-warns-court-against-changing-liability-shield-for-internet-companies.html#tk.rss_all</guid>

  <p id="46BlJ1">ExxonMobil predicted rising global temperatures with remarkable accuracy even as it attempted to downplay the existence of climate change, new research shows. It comes with damning data visualizations that put hard numbers on just how much ExxonMobil knew about the climate crisis it was creating. </p>
<p id="K1S5Ah">There’s been a litany of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/23/16194366/exxon-mobil-knew-climate-change-misinformation-harvard-study">evidence</a> about how ExxonMobil rejected mainstream climate science, even though the company’s own research and internal communications acknowledged that burning fossil fuels would cause global warming. Now, a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abk0063">paper</a> published today in the journal <em>Science</em> gives us the first comprehensive review of decades of ExxonMobil climate models. And the company’s projections for how much global temperatures would rise over the years...</p>

<item><title>![CDATA[Show HN: Ecode – A minimalist and fast open-source code editor]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Hi HN! I've been working on a code editor and I think that it's mature enough to catch some interest. It's using a custom GPU accelerated GUI written in C++. Currently implements some interesting features: LSP, terminal, auto-completion, linters, formatters, custom keybindings, plugins and more. It's a hobby project but still intends to be an alternative to other popular code editors like Sublime, Kate, Lapce, Lite XL (and takes inspiration from them).
The project was born as a playground for the GUI I'm developing (eepp GUI) and is advanced enough to currently be my main code editor, but it's a work in progress, and many features are still pending.
Some minor hints on how to use it:
Folders are used as project (and .gitignore is used to ignore files)
The wheel icon on the top-right has all the options you need (Ctrl/Cmd + M to show).
Some keybidings to navigate any project (navigation is keyboard driven):
Ctrl/Cmd + K = Locate Files
Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + F = Global Search
Ctrl/Cmd + Number (Go to tab #)</p>

<item><title>![CDATA[Jordan Peterson releases Ontario College's complaints against him, it's basically a promo for Jordan's Twitter]]</title><description>![CDATA[<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=32644371&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C119" /><br /><br /><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-peterson-college-psycology" target="_blank">Jordan Peterson</a> published 56 pages detailing the Ontario College of Psychologists' complaints against him, which led to their assertion that he needs to attend a social media reeducation camp. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cI promised I would post the allegations today. These pages are screenshots of original documents, so everyone interested can decide for themselves what is going on @JustnTrudeau included (take note: @PierrePoilievre).  https://t.co/7kekpXTQtt\u201d</div> — Dr Jordan B Peterson (@Dr Jordan B Peterson)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/1611177250107396097">1672865116</a>
</blockquote>
<p>The first complaint claimed Peterson encouraged people to commit suicide on Twitter. </p><p>The tweet in question arose from a thread where Peterson said the world will peak at 9.5 billion people, and that it will still be a prosperous world. A scientist responded in disagreement, saying, "Any arguments I have heard for supporting such a large human population completely overlook the huge loss of species and ecosystems resulting from our self-absorbed attention.”</p><p>Jordan responded, "You're free to leave at any point."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cJordan Peterson uploaded a document with screenshots of the complaints made against him to the College of Psychologists.\n\nThe first allegation is that he, a licensed psychologist, made a joke about suicide directed at someone on Twitter.\n\nHere's what else it shows.\n\nStrap in.\u201d</div> — Rachel Gilmore (@Rachel Gilmore)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/atRachelGilmore/status/1611405636931141632">1673024016</a>
</blockquote>
<p>Another complaint said he “publicly opined that no Children’s Aid Society intervention is required in a public review of the Ottawa <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/justin-trudeau-declares-truckers-terrorists" target="_blank">trucker protest</a>.” It referenced when Peterson tweeted, "children removed?’ how, exactly? Why, exactly? By whom, exactly? Sent to where, exactly? And for how long, exactly? Think this through, Canadians. This is a bad decision.”</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201c"children removed" how, exactly? Why, exactly? By whom, exactly? Sent to where, exactly? And for how long, exactly? Think this through, Canadians. This is a bad decision.\u201d</div> — Dr Jordan B Peterson (@Dr Jordan B Peterson)

</blockquote>
<p>And another complaint mentioned Peterson's iconic "not beautiful" tweet regarding an extra brave and beautiful bathing suit model. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cSorry. Not beautiful. And no amount of authoritarian tolerance is going to change that.\u201d</div> — Dr Jordan B Peterson (@Dr Jordan B Peterson)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/1526279181545390083">1652728288</a>
</blockquote>
<p>The complaint claimed this was "dangerous" for a psychologist to say because of the prevalence of eating disorders in Canada. One could argue a few too many Krispy Kremes can also be "dangerous."  </p><p>Many complaints centered on Peterson's criticism of transgenderism. One complainant said, "he has failed to advocate for the autonomy and dignity of transgendered persons." <br /></p><p>Last June, Peterson's Twitter account was suspended after he tweeted, "Remember when pride was a sin? And Ellen Page just had her breasts removed by a criminal physician." Where is the lie, though?</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cOkay, so now you can get banned for calling people by their name? @jordanbpeterson just got suspended from Twitter for writing that Ellen Page removed her breasts. Nothing wrong about it, even if Elliott Page is the preferred name now. \n\nPlease clean this place up, @elonmusk.\u201d</div> — Ivar Arpi (@Ivar Arpi)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/Ivarpi/status/1542270194709561345">1656540843</a>
</blockquote>
<p>There were numerous other complaints about COVID and Peterson's appearance on Joe Rogan. One complainant actually submitted the entire transcript of Peterson's 3-hour appearance on Joe Rogan. </p><p>In conclusion, the College of Ontario Psychologists essentially created a highlight reel of Jordan's Twitter. I honestly forgot just how cool he is until I read this document. </p><p>Peterson said he will ignore the paperwork that came with each complaint because it's too time-consuming. He submitted an application for judicial review to the Ontario Divisional Court.  He also said he will not complete the social media coaching mandated by the college, which would be at his own expense and cost up to $225 an hour. </p><p><p>

France's National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL) has <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/identifiant-publicitaire-sanction-de-8-millions-deuros-lencontre-de-apple-distribution-international">issued</a> an €8 million (roughly $8.5 million) penalty over allegations Apple automatically collected identifying data from App Store visitors using iOS 14.6 without their permission, helping the company target ads. The firm was profiting from violations of data protection law, according to officials.</p><p>You could turn off the ad targeting, but it was enabled by default and couldn't be disabled without wading through multiple menu levels, CNIL added. That reportedly made it impossible for users to give proper consent. Apple has since changed its practices, and CNIL said it conducted &quot;several&quot; checks between 2021 and 2022 to make sure the company was honoring data rules. France launched its investigation in March 2021.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We've asked Apple for comment. As <em>9to5Mac</em> noted, Apple told <em>Financial Times</em>' Patrick McGee in a <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickMcGee_/status/1610691371836510209">statement</a> that it was &quot;disappointed&quot; with the decision and planned an appeal. The iPhone maker argued that its Search Ads system went &quot;further&quot; than any rival in offering choice over targeted ads, and didn't track user cross third-party apps or websites.</p><p>Apple has had a contentious relationship with French regulators. In 2020, the country's competition authority issued a fine equivalent to $1.2 billion (now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wins-appeal-lower-antitrust-fine-in-france-094034302.html">down to $364.6 million</a>) for alleged antitrust abuses in its distribution chain. The company also received a $27.3 million fine over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-07-france-apple-ios-slowdown-fine.html">iPhone performance throttling</a> that same year. While the French government defended Apple's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/french-companies-fail-in-bid-to-limit-apples-i-os-14-tracking-protections-121521004.html">iOS 14 anti-tracking measures</a> against industry pressure, it's evident that the brand remains under close scrutiny.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2023-01-04 21:17:50+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.engadget.com/apple-france-fine-app-store-targeted-ads-211750930.html?src=rss</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.engadget.com/apple-france-fine-app-store-targeted-ads-211750930.html?src=rss</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Preparing for Less Privacy]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p><span>

An </span>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/giving-up-on-privacy">old privacy post</a> of mine
recently got a lot of discussion 

<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34173058">on Hacker
News</a>.  It seems people took me to be saying something like:



<p>

</p>

<blockquote>

Other people are foolish to be worried about privacy.  If there's
anything you don't want public it's probably because you're doing
something you shouldn't.  The decrease in privacy over time will be
great for everyone once we adapt to it, and has no downsides.

</blockquote>



<p>

To be clear, this isn't (and wasn't) my view.  There are a lot
of situations in which it makes sense for someone to take careful
steps to preserve various forms of privacy, there are things
people wouldn't want public for very good reasons, and decreasing
privacy has real harms.

</p>

<p>

But I also think it's very risky to rely on privacy. Many ordinary
things we do expose more than we probably expect.  What could someone
infer from the timing of your posts or messages? Background details in
pictures?  Cell tower logs of your movements?

</p>

<p>

One of the major effects of increasing technology has been decreasing
privacy.  Cheap fast computers and storage make many things possible
at massive scale that would have been infeasible before.  For example,
cars have had license plates for a century but it wouldn't have been
practical to use them to build up a detailed record of traffic at
large. Banknotes have (always?) had serial numbers, but people
receiving bills didn't check them, record them, or use them to build
up a record of how cash moves around our society.  People have
(always!) had faces, but looking through the enormous number of
published photos to pick out ones with your face wasn't practical.

</p>

<p>

Another way that technology offers the opportunity for reduced privacy
is that more interactions happen via computer, where they can easily
be logged and categorized.  For example, when I visit a typical web
page, many <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/why-i-work-on-ads">trackers record this
visit</a>, and connect it to other pages I've visited.  Similarly,
most of my communication with others is now via text on computers,
which is quite amenable to automated analysis.

</p>

<p>

I expect this trend to continue: computers are continuing to get
smaller, cheaper, and faster.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)">Transformers</a>
have turned out to be incredibly capable. People building things that
collect and correlate this information are still adapting to the
technology of several years ago, let alone what's still coming out.

</p>

<p>

On the other hand, there are some trends in the other direction.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_law">Privacy
legislation</a>, really taking off with Europe's 2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>
(effective 2018), has made some forms of data collection and
processing require the consent of the people it's about.  I haven't
found great polling on people's level of privacy concerns over time,
but the small amount I have found does <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/232319/facebook-users-privacy-concerns-2011.aspx">show
an increase</a>.  Technology options that make sacrifices for the sake
of user privacy (<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DDG</a>, <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Signal</a>, etc) are growing, though
from a small base (and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> is
declining, down to 3% from a peak of 32%).

</p>

<p>

Where does this leave us?  Several thoughts:

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Despite the changes in sentiment and regulation around privacy,
I don't think a private future is something we can count on. I think
it's more likely than not that systems that can wring a great deal of
meaning out of everything everyone has done publicly are wildly
deployed during our lifetimes, probably within the next ten years.
Hacks, leaks, and blunders that expose information you trusted others
to keep private are also going to be a continuing fact of life,
accelerated by digitization.

</p></li>
<li><p>Since we can't trust the future to keep things private, my
general approach to privacy is still to treat even nominally private
things as if they might become public, and act accordingly.
Habitually making things public is one way to make this a lower
burden, and is one which has some advantages (better feedback from
others, sharing information others can benefit from, etc).

</p></li>
<li><p>Efforts to promote a more private future, through technology or
regulation, <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/effective-altruism-and-everyday-decisions">individual
choice</a> or professional work, may or may not be worth it depending
on how you view the chances of success and the benefits if successful.
I think this is very unlikely to beat work on things like 80k's <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/">most pressing
problems</a>, but I expect some people have high enough estimates on
the value of privacy work (ex: risk of <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/risks-of-stable-totalitarianism/">stable
totalitarianism</a>, suppression of important but unpopular ideas)
that they'll disagree.

</p></li>
</ul>
