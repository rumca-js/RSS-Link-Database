  <p id="Yv9QQv">Google is running tests that block access to news for some Canadian users in response to a new bill that could force it and other large platforms like Meta’s Facebook to negotiate deals with news publishers to pay them for content, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-tests-blocking-news-content-some-canadians-2023-02-23/"><em>Reuters</em> reports</a>. The tests will reportedly impact less than four percent of Canadian users, <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/north-america/google-news-blocks-canada-experiments-prompted-by-online-news-act-could-affect-1m-plus-users/">run for around five weeks</a>, and will “limit the visibility of Canadian and international news to varying degrees.” </p>
<p id="ZWto9l">The tests come in response to Canada’s Online News Act, also known as “Bill C-18,” which is currently being considered by the Canadian Senate, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theglobeandmail.com%2Fpolitics%2Farticle-google-tests-blocking-of-news-sites-in-response-to-canadas-online-news%2F%3Futm_source%3Ddlvr.it%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F2%2F24%2F23613187%2Fgoogle-canada-news-block-online-act-bill-c-18" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">according to <em>The Globe and Mail</em></a>. </p>

<item><title>![CDATA[Tell HN: Do not store any funds in PayPal or use them for anything critical]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>I know this has been covered over and over, but I always thought there must be more to the story when someones account was permanently banned. Well, it happened to me, one of the most plain and boring consumer users of PayPal ever.<p>I have used PayPal for over a decade, usually once or twice a month to make small purchases when buying something off Craigslist or Facebook marketplace. I also occasionally use it to split dinner with friends. I don't use it for business and I don't use it for anything sketchy.<p>I recently received an email from PayPal saying that my account had been permanently banned. No appeal, no reason given. I logged in separately to make sure this was a real email, at first I thought it must be phishing. It was real.<p>The only thing I can think of which might have precipitated this. I got a few invoice requests though PayPal a while ago from people/businesses I had never heard of. This is a well known and documented scam where they spam invoices en-masse and hope some people pay them accidentally (I did not pay them, but the PayPal UI makes this very easy to do and there is no way to decline or dismiss the requests).<p>Not a big deal for me since I don't use PayPal for anything critical, but I figured a reminder was in order in case anyone still thinks it won't happen to them. If it could happen to me, it can happen to anyone.</p>

  <p id="gS0Sid">Microsoft says it’s implementing some conversation limits to its Bing AI just days after the chatbot went off the rails multiple times for users. Bing chats will now be capped at 50 questions per day and five per session after the search engine <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/15/23599072/microsoft-ai-bing-personality-conversations-spy-employees-webcams">was seen insulting users</a>, lying to them, and emotionally manipulating people.</p>
<p id="hSVSZo">“Our data has shown that the vast majority of people find the answers they’re looking for within 5 turns and that only around 1 percent of chat conversations have 50+ messages,” <a href="https://blogs.bing.com/search/february-2023/The-new-Bing-Edge-%E2%80%93-Updates-to-Chat">says the Bing team in a blog post</a>. If users hit the five-per-session limit, Bing will prompt them to start a new topic to avoid long back-and-forth chat sessions.</p>
<p id="Y9aLdQ"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/16/23602335/microsoft-bing-ai-testing-learnings-response">Microsoft warned earlier this week</a> that these longer chat sessions, with 15 or more...</p>

  <p id="zGvqGy">The European Parliament has given its formal approval to new vehicle emissions standards that would effectively ban the widespread sale of combustion engine cars and vans in the 27-country bloc by 2035, the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230210IPR74715/fit-for-55-zero-co2-emissions-for-new-cars-and-vans-in-2035?uuid=ubs7QeNFqqMnM6AS1833">organization announced today</a>.

I’ve spent hundreds of hours binging series and movies on both platforms, but neither seems able to use this to suggest anything I like. I’ll probably cancel at least Netflix.<p>It would be so easy: 
- Store series I‘ve watched, show me new seasons when they release. - neither does it reliably.
- Don’t keep suggesting things I have watched, except in a „watch again“ category. Especially using new pictures, getting me to click on the same stuff only to realize that I have seen this already.<p>Given the billions invested in these UIs, how can they fail so miserably? What am I missing? This makes no economic sense … or am I just a weird edge case, and this kind of UI works for the majority?</p>

The first big thing that's killing the open internet is centralization by big companies.
Big tech companies like Apple, Google, or Microsoft are making all efforts to ensure that their users stick to their online services and products, and this ends up dictating what parts of the internet you end up accessing or not.

Using a specific web browser means you're using a specific engine, which dictates what you can or can't do online. It's also the search engines from these companies that will dictate which websites surface, and which don't. The algorithms from the platforms you use, like youtube for video, Facebook, or Twitter will define what content you see, and what content you don't.

And then you have the lack of interoperability between services. But this stuff, you can still bypass yourself. More concerning is what countries do to limit what you can and can't access. 

https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/internet-censorship-map/

Countries implement various filters that are basically censorship. Some of it is acceptable, like blocking illegal material, and some of it is more questionable, like blocking websites that reference various copyrighted materials.

All these filters make the internet less open: you can't freely access what you're looking for if your country decides it's not allowed.

When filters aren't enough, countries now implement full internet blackouts, generally to deal with protests against the government's actions. In 2020, 268 million people had their internet access shut down, that's 49% more than in 2019.

While these blackouts are selective, and can still let governments access the internet themselves while the general public can't, they're devastating for a country's economy and business, and they can't be maintained for very long periods of time.

https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/the-global-economic-damage-of-internet-blackouts/503093/

https://news.yahoo.com/268-million-people-had-internet-122208785.html

https://www.wired.com/story/iran-internet-blackout-economy/

Now, the ultimate candidate against the open web is what China has built. They might be linked to the general internet everybody else enjoys, but it's a one way street: people can access their websites, but Chinese people can't access most of the rest of the internet, being limited to what the Chinese government allows.

China has built their own entire alternative internet, with their own services and their own websites, and it's not for nothing that we're talking about the great firewall of china, because when you're in there, you can't access anything the government has deemed "not ok".

https://priteshpawar.com/chinese-alternatives-to-popular-apps-and-websites/tech-industry-and-case-studies/priteshpawar/
 that it would be a grave mistake to let their citizens have access to information sources that 

Of course, it's not all doom and gloom. The internet is showing signs of healing, at least on certain fronts.

First, decentralized services are emerging again, slowly offering alternatives to the big closed down networks. Mastodon for example is a success story of a federated, decentralized network offering a viable alternative to Twitter, and that can talk to a variety of other services, like Pixelfed, Wordpress, Peerube, Castopod, and the like.

Various laws are also being passed, forcing big tech companies to relinquish a bit of control, over their platforms or app stores, for example, with Apple being forced in the EU to have iMessage be interoperable, and allowing 3rd party app stores on iOS.]]</description><pubDate>2023-02-09 17:34:16+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjTzQJxw-20</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjTzQJxw-20</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[All the big tech layoffs of 2023]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>The tech industry is reeling from the combination of a rough economy, the COVID-19 pandemic, and not to mention some obvious business missteps. And while that led to job cuts in 2022, the headcount reductions have unfortunately ramped up in 2023. It can be tough to keep track of these moves, so we’ve compiled all the major layoffs in one place and will update as the situation evolves.</p><h2>Amazon layoffs</h2><p></p><figure><img alt="MADRID, SPAIN - NOVEMBER 15: An Amazon logistics center, on November 15, 2022, in Madrid, Spain. U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon is considering job cuts among its corporate and technology workforce of up to 10,000 employees. The layoffs are equivalent to 0.65% of Amazon's total global workforce of 1.54 million employees. The employee layoffs are focused on the company's devices area, where the Alexa voice assistant business is included, as well as in the 'retail' and human resources branches.

To no one's surprise, CEO Andy Jassy blamed both an &quot;uncertain economy&quot; and rapid hiring in recent years. Amazon<a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-q1-2021-210221698.html"> benefited tremendously</a> from the pandemic as people shifted to online shopping, but its<a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-q1-2022-earnings-growth-235926922.html"> growth is slowing</a> as people return to in-person stores.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Coinbase layoffs</h2><p></p><figure><img alt="A representation of the cryptocurrency is seen in front of Coinbase logo in this illustration taken, March 4, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/626c8b30-c247-11ec-afdb-180c59bc3f65" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">REUTERS/Dado Ruvic</div></figure><p>Coinbase was one of the larger companies impacted by the crypto market's 2022 downturn, and that carried over into the new year. The cryptocurrency exchange<a href="https://www.engadget.com/coinbase-lay-offs-reduced-expenses-153433234.html"> laid off 950 people</a> in mid-January, just months after it<a href="https://www.engadget.com/coinbase-job-cuts-layoffs-150838290.html"> slashed 1,100 roles</a>. This is one of the steepest proportionate cuts among larger tech brands — Coinbase offloaded about a fifth of its staff. Chief Brian Armstrong said his outfit needed the layoffs to shrink operating expenses and survive what he previously described as a &quot;crypto winter,&quot; but that also meant canceling some projects that were less likely to succeed.</p><h2>Google (Alphabet) layoffs</h2><h2></h2><figure><img alt="An exterior view of building BV100, during a tour of Google's new Bay View Campus in Mountain View, California, U.S. May 16, 2022.

CEO Sundar Pichai wasn't shy about the reasoning: Alphabet had been hiring for a &quot;different economic reality,&quot; and was restructuring to focus on the internet giant's most important businesses. The decision hit the company's Area 120 incubator<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-lays-off-most-employees-area-120-in-house-incubator-154329887.html"> particularly hard</a>, with the majority of the unit's workers losing their jobs. Sub-brands like Intrinsic (robotics) and Verily (health) also shed significant portions of their workforce in the days before the mass layoffs.</p><h2>IBM layoffs</h2><h2></h2><figure><img alt="The IBM logo is pictured in the Garibaldi-Porta Nuova modern district of Milan  on June 22, 2021. (Photo by MIGUEL MEDINA / AFP) (Photo by MIGUEL MEDINA/AFP via Getty Images)" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/9ea9c430-a33a-11ed-91cf-0987899998eb" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">MIGUEL MEDINA via Getty Images</div></figure><p>Layoffs sometimes stem more from corporate strategy shifts than financial hardship, and IBM provided a classic example of this in 2023. The computing pioneer<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-25/ibm-to-cut-about-3-900-workers-still-hiring-in-higher-growth-areas?sref=10lNAhZ9"> axed 3,900 jobs</a> in late January after offloading both its AI-driven Watson Health business and its infrastructure management division (now Kyndryl) in the fall. Simply put, those employees had nothing to work on as IBM pivoted toward cloud computing.</p><h2>Microsoft layoffs</h2><p></p><figure><img alt="A person walks past Microsoft signage at the headquarters in Redmond, Washington, U.S., January 18, 2023.

Like many other tech heavyweights, it was trimming costs as customers<a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-q2-fy23-earnings-report-211718819.html"> scaled back their spending</a> (particularly on Windows and devices) during the pandemic recovery. The reductions were especially painful for some divisions — they reportedly<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsoft-has-laid-off-entire-teams-behind-virtual-mixed-reality-and-hololens"> gutted the HoloLens and mixed reality teams</a>, while 343 Industries is believed to be<a href="https://www.engadget.com/343-industries-halo-unreal-engine-202439779.html"> rebooting Halo development</a> after losing dozens of workers.</p><h2>PayPal layoffs</h2><p></p><figure><img alt="SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 02: A sign is posted in front of PayPal headquarters on February 02, 2023 in San Jose, California.

Still, it hasn't been immune to a tough economy. The online payment firm unveiled plans at the end of January to<a href="https://www.engadget.com/paypal-is-laying-off-2000-employees-212108119.html"> lay off 2,000 employees</a>, or seven percent of its total worker base.

While the cloud software brand thrived during the pandemic with rapidly growing revenue, it admitted that it hired too aggressively during the boom and couldn't maintain that staffing level while the economy was in decline.</p><h2>SAP layoffs</h2><p></p><figure><img alt="The logo of German software group SAP is pictured at its headquarters in Walldorf, Germany, May 12, 2016. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/f5d8cf40-a33e-11ed-bdf5-7c87e4bd5b2e" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski</div></figure><p>Business software powerhouse SAP saw a steep 68 percent drop in profit at the end of 2022, and it started 2023 by<a href="https://news.sap.com/2023/01/sap-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-results/"> laying off 2,800 staff</a> to keep its business healthy. Unlike some big names in tech, though, SAP didn't blame excessive pandemic-era hiring for the cutback. Instead, it characterized the initiative as a &quot;targeted restructuring&quot; for a company that still expected accelerating growth in 2023.</p><h2>Spotify layoffs</h2><h2></h2><figure><img alt="NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 23: People are seen inside the Spotify headquarters building in Lower Manhattan on January 23, 2023 in New York City.

The streaming music service said in late January that it would<a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-will-lay-off-6-percent-of-employees-130337498.html"> lay off 6 percent of its workforce</a> (9,800 people worked at Spotify as of the third quarter) alongside a restructuring effort that included the departure of content chief Dawn Ostroff. While there were more Premium subscribers than ever in 2022, the company also<a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-reaches-205-million-premium-subscribers-as-losses-mount-122503157.html"> suffered steep losses</a> — CEO Daniel Ek said he was &quot;too ambitious&quot; investing before the revenue existed to support it.</p><h2>Wayfair layoffs</h2><h2></h2><figure><img alt="NATICK, MA - AUGUST 20: A virtual reality app is demonstrated at Wayfair's first store in the Natick Mall in Natick, MA on Aug. 20, 2019. Shoppers can don virtual reality headsets to see how furniture would fit into a space, using Wayfairs Room Planner tool. They can virtually climb onto a dining room table to get a 360-degree view of a digitally rendered room, then swap out chairs, chandeliers, and art on the virtual walls. Thats just one example of how the Boston-based e-commerce giant has used its digital DNA to create its first brick-and-mortar store. It opens Wednesday in the Natick Mall. Product information, including prices and customer ratings, is displayed on screens that update in real time to reflect online price changes. Staffers carry iPads with an augmented reality tool that makes furniture appear in a 3-D setting, or they can snap a picture of an item in the store and find dozens like it online.

About 1,200 of those were corporate staff cut in a bid to &quot;eliminate management layers&quot; and otherwise help the company become leaner and nimbler. Wayfair had been cutting costs since August 2022 (including 870 positions), but saw the layoffs as helping it reach break-even earnings sooner than expected.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2023-02-03 18:30:05+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.engadget.com/tech-layoffs-183005204.html?src=rss</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.engadget.com/tech-layoffs-183005204.html?src=rss</guid>

(<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/12/velma-review-mindy-kaling-scooby-doo">Except, rather weirdly, the Guardian</a>, which gave it four out of five stars.) The cartoon premiered last week to <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/mindy-kalings-scooby-doo-spinoff-222804326.html">mostly abysmal reviews.</a> Things are so dire that there are even <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/01/14/velma-is-so-bad-its-spawned-psyop-conspiracy-theories/?sh=12a1ce1912e2">conspiracy theories</a> swirling that Mindy Kaling, its star and an executive producer of the show, made Velma terrible on purpose in order to make the left look bad.</p><p>Why would Kaling do something like that? I have no idea. My understanding is that she probably didn’t and that people are just getting angry online because people like getting angry online. The left appears to be angry at Kaling because she once liked a tweet by JK Rowling, which supposedly means she is an irredeemable <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=kaling%20trans&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">transphobe</a> who should be cancelled immediately. The right, meanwhile, doesn’t seem to like the fact that Velma is a lesbian in the show and Kaling is a brown woman. One rightwing comedian called it “<a href="https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/comment/scooby-doo-spin-velma-isnt-28950816">openly racist against white people</a>”. Other people are saying the series is “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/adult-scooby-doo-reboot-velma-ripped-critics-audiences-where-everything-horribly-wrong">insulting to the Scooby-Doo fanbase</a>”. The series really touches pretty much every aspect of the culture wars.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/18/velma-lesbian-detective-scooby-doo-fans-hate">Continue reading...</a>]]</description><pubDate>2023-01-18 07:00:38+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/18/velma-lesbian-detective-scooby-doo-fans-hate</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/18/velma-lesbian-detective-scooby-doo-fans-hate</guid>

	<section class="page">
<p>In a defense brief filed to the US Supreme Court this week, Google warned that altering Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — which protects internet-based companies from being sued for content created by their users — would "upend the internet."</p><p>The brief was filed as part of Google's defense in a lawsuit brought by the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old US citizen who was killed by ISIS in Paris in November 2015. Oral arguments for the case are set to be heard on February 21.</p><p>The family argues that Google-owned YouTube violated the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) when its algorithms recommended ISIS-related content to users.

And the company’s projections for how much global temperatures would rise over the years...</p>

<item><title>![CDATA[Show HN: Ecode – A minimalist and fast open-source code editor]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Hi HN! I've been working on a code editor and I think that it's mature enough to catch some interest. It's using a custom GPU accelerated GUI written in C++. Currently implements some interesting features: LSP, terminal, auto-completion, linters, formatters, custom keybindings, plugins and more. It's a hobby project but still intends to be an alternative to other popular code editors like Sublime, Kate, Lapce, Lite XL (and takes inspiration from them).
The project was born as a playground for the GUI I'm developing (eepp GUI) and is advanced enough to currently be my main code editor, but it's a work in progress, and many features are still pending.
Some minor hints on how to use it:
Folders are used as project (and .gitignore is used to ignore files)
The wheel icon on the top-right has all the options you need (Ctrl/Cmd + M to show).
Some keybidings to navigate any project (navigation is keyboard driven):
Ctrl/Cmd + K = Locate Files
Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + F = Global Search
Ctrl/Cmd + Number (Go to tab #)</p>

<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cI promised I would post the allegations today. These pages are screenshots of original documents, so everyone interested can decide for themselves what is going on @JustnTrudeau included (take note: @PierrePoilievre).  https://t.co/7kekpXTQtt\u201d</div> — Dr Jordan B Peterson (@Dr Jordan B Peterson)

</blockquote>
<p>The first complaint claimed Peterson encouraged people to commit suicide on Twitter. </p><p>The tweet in question arose from a thread where Peterson said the world will peak at 9.5 billion people, and that it will still be a prosperous world. A scientist responded in disagreement, saying, "Any arguments I have heard for supporting such a large human population completely overlook the huge loss of species and ecosystems resulting from our self-absorbed attention.”</p><p>Jordan responded, "You're free to leave at any point."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cJordan Peterson uploaded a document with screenshots of the complaints made against him to the College of Psychologists.\n\nThe first allegation is that he, a licensed psychologist, made a joke about suicide directed at someone on Twitter.\n\nHere's what else it shows.\n\nStrap in.\u201d</div> — Rachel Gilmore (@Rachel Gilmore)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/atRachelGilmore/status/1611405636931141632">1673024016</a>

<p>Another complaint said he “publicly opined that no Children’s Aid Society intervention is required in a public review of the Ottawa <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/justin-trudeau-declares-truckers-terrorists" target="_blank">trucker protest</a>.” It referenced when Peterson tweeted, "children removed?’ how, exactly? Why, exactly? By whom, exactly? Sent to where, exactly? And for how long, exactly? Think this through, Canadians. This is a bad decision.”</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201c"children removed" how, exactly? Why, exactly? By whom, exactly? Sent to where, exactly? And for how long, exactly? Think this through, Canadians. This is a bad decision.\u201d</div> — Dr Jordan B Peterson (@Dr Jordan B Peterson)

</blockquote>
<p>And another complaint mentioned Peterson's iconic "not beautiful" tweet regarding an extra brave and beautiful bathing suit model. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cSorry. Not beautiful. And no amount of authoritarian tolerance is going to change that.\u201d</div> — Dr Jordan B Peterson (@Dr Jordan B Peterson)

</blockquote>
<p>The complaint claimed this was "dangerous" for a psychologist to say because of the prevalence of eating disorders in Canada. One could argue a few too many Krispy Kremes can also be "dangerous."  </p><p>Many complaints centered on Peterson's criticism of transgenderism. One complainant said, "he has failed to advocate for the autonomy and dignity of transgendered persons." <br /></p><p>Last June, Peterson's Twitter account was suspended after he tweeted, "Remember when pride was a sin? And Ellen Page just had her breasts removed by a criminal physician." Where is the lie, though?</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cOkay, so now you can get banned for calling people by their name? @jordanbpeterson just got suspended from Twitter for writing that Ellen Page removed her breasts. Nothing wrong about it, even if Elliott Page is the preferred name now. \n\nPlease clean this place up, @elonmusk.\u201d</div> — Ivar Arpi (@Ivar Arpi)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/Ivarpi/status/1542270194709561345">1656540843</a>
</blockquote>
<p>There were numerous other complaints about COVID and Peterson's appearance on Joe Rogan. One complainant actually submitted the entire transcript of Peterson's 3-hour appearance on Joe Rogan. </p><p>In conclusion, the College of Ontario Psychologists essentially created a highlight reel of Jordan's Twitter. I honestly forgot just how cool he is until I read this document. </p><p>Peterson said he will ignore the paperwork that came with each complaint because it's too time-consuming. He submitted an application for judicial review to the Ontario Divisional Court.  He also said he will not complete the social media coaching mandated by the college, which would be at his own expense and cost up to $225 an hour. </p><p><p>

France's National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL) has <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/identifiant-publicitaire-sanction-de-8-millions-deuros-lencontre-de-apple-distribution-international">issued</a> an €8 million (roughly $8.5 million) penalty over allegations Apple automatically collected identifying data from App Store visitors using iOS 14.6 without their permission, helping the company target ads. The firm was profiting from violations of data protection law, according to officials.</p><p>You could turn off the ad targeting, but it was enabled by default and couldn't be disabled without wading through multiple menu levels, CNIL added. That reportedly made it impossible for users to give proper consent. Apple has since changed its practices, and CNIL said it conducted &quot;several&quot; checks between 2021 and 2022 to make sure the company was honoring data rules. France launched its investigation in March 2021.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We've asked Apple for comment. As <em>9to5Mac</em> noted, Apple told <em>Financial Times</em>' Patrick McGee in a <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickMcGee_/status/1610691371836510209">statement</a> that it was &quot;disappointed&quot; with the decision and planned an appeal. The iPhone maker argued that its Search Ads system went &quot;further&quot; than any rival in offering choice over targeted ads, and didn't track user cross third-party apps or websites.</p><p>Apple has had a contentious relationship with French regulators. In 2020, the country's competition authority issued a fine equivalent to $1.2 billion (now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wins-appeal-lower-antitrust-fine-in-france-094034302.html">down to $364.6 million</a>) for alleged antitrust abuses in its distribution chain. The company also received a $27.3 million fine over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-07-france-apple-ios-slowdown-fine.html">iPhone performance throttling</a> that same year. While the French government defended Apple's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/french-companies-fail-in-bid-to-limit-apples-i-os-14-tracking-protections-121521004.html">iOS 14 anti-tracking measures</a> against industry pressure, it's evident that the brand remains under close scrutiny.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2023-01-04 21:17:50+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.engadget.com/apple-france-fine-app-store-targeted-ads-211750930.html?src=rss</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.engadget.com/apple-france-fine-app-store-targeted-ads-211750930.html?src=rss</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Preparing for Less Privacy]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p><span>

An </span>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/giving-up-on-privacy">old privacy post</a> of mine
recently got a lot of discussion 

<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34173058">on Hacker
News</a>.  It seems people took me to be saying something like:



<p>

</p>

<blockquote>

Other people are foolish to be worried about privacy.  If there's
anything you don't want public it's probably because you're doing
something you shouldn't.  The decrease in privacy over time will be
great for everyone once we adapt to it, and has no downsides.

</blockquote>



<p>

To be clear, this isn't (and wasn't) my view.  There are a lot
of situations in which it makes sense for someone to take careful
steps to preserve various forms of privacy, there are things
people wouldn't want public for very good reasons, and decreasing
privacy has real harms.

</p>

<p>

But I also think it's very risky to rely on privacy. Many ordinary
things we do expose more than we probably expect.  What could someone
infer from the timing of your posts or messages? Background details in
pictures?  Cell tower logs of your movements?

</p>

<p>

One of the major effects of increasing technology has been decreasing
privacy.  Cheap fast computers and storage make many things possible
at massive scale that would have been infeasible before.  For example,
cars have had license plates for a century but it wouldn't have been
practical to use them to build up a detailed record of traffic at
large. Banknotes have (always?) had serial numbers, but people
receiving bills didn't check them, record them, or use them to build
up a record of how cash moves around our society.  People have
(always!) had faces, but looking through the enormous number of
published photos to pick out ones with your face wasn't practical.

</p>

<p>

Another way that technology offers the opportunity for reduced privacy
is that more interactions happen via computer, where they can easily
be logged and categorized.  For example, when I visit a typical web
page, many <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/why-i-work-on-ads">trackers record this
visit</a>, and connect it to other pages I've visited.  Similarly,
most of my communication with others is now via text on computers,
which is quite amenable to automated analysis.

</p>

<p>

I expect this trend to continue: computers are continuing to get
smaller, cheaper, and faster.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)">Transformers</a>
have turned out to be incredibly capable. People building things that
collect and correlate this information are still adapting to the
technology of several years ago, let alone what's still coming out.

</p>

<p>

On the other hand, there are some trends in the other direction.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_law">Privacy
legislation</a>, really taking off with Europe's 2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>
(effective 2018), has made some forms of data collection and
processing require the consent of the people it's about.  I haven't
found great polling on people's level of privacy concerns over time,
but the small amount I have found does <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/232319/facebook-users-privacy-concerns-2011.aspx">show
an increase</a>.  Technology options that make sacrifices for the sake
of user privacy (<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DDG</a>, <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Signal</a>, etc) are growing, though
from a small base (and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> is
declining, down to 3% from a peak of 32%).

</p>

<p>

Where does this leave us?  Several thoughts:

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Despite the changes in sentiment and regulation around privacy,
I don't think a private future is something we can count on. I think
it's more likely than not that systems that can wring a great deal of
meaning out of everything everyone has done publicly are wildly
deployed during our lifetimes, probably within the next ten years.
Hacks, leaks, and blunders that expose information you trusted others
to keep private are also going to be a continuing fact of life,
accelerated by digitization.

</p></li>
<li><p>Since we can't trust the future to keep things private, my
general approach to privacy is still to treat even nominally private
things as if they might become public, and act accordingly.
Habitually making things public is one way to make this a lower
burden, and is one which has some advantages (better feedback from
others, sharing information others can benefit from, etc).

</p></li>
<li><p>Efforts to promote a more private future, through technology or
regulation, <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/effective-altruism-and-everyday-decisions">individual
choice</a> or professional work, may or may not be worth it depending
on how you view the chances of success and the benefits if successful.
I think this is very unlikely to beat work on things like 80k's <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/">most pressing
problems</a>, but I expect some people have high enough estimates on
the value of privacy work (ex: risk of <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/risks-of-stable-totalitarianism/">stable
totalitarianism</a>, suppression of important but unpopular ideas)
that they'll disagree.

</p></li>
</ul>
