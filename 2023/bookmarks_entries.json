He was gone for a year and a half. The damage done to their family \u2013 and so many others like them \u2013 was incalculable</p><p>Huda Dahbour was 35 years old when she moved with her husband and three children to the West Bank in September 1995. It was the second anniversary of the Oslo accords, which established pockets of Palestinian self-government in the occupied territories. Jerusalem was still relatively open when they arrived in East Sawahre, a neighbourhood just outside the areas of Jerusalem that Israel had annexed in 1967.

Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2008, 2013, 2018, 2021 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Fighting junk fees is \"woke\" (permalink) \"Populism\" isn't intrinsically left or right. The distinction between the two is often obscured by jargon, but there's a simple litmus test (courtesy of Steven Brust): \"ask what's more important: human rights, or property rights. If they say 'property rights are human rights,' they're on the right.\" Which is to say, both the left and the right can be populist, but the populist left seeks to improve peoples' lives, no matter what that takes, while the populist right is only willing to make the world better when that doesn't interfere with the interests of property owners. This is how you get the Libertarian Party of New Hampshire equating publicly produced, free insulin with forcing enslaved Black people to pick cotton in the fields: https://newrepublic.com/post/174485/libertarian-party-suggests-former-black-lawmaker-pick-crops-free For right populists, the property rights of pharma giants are human rights, so anything that interferes with those rights is equivalent to any other human rights violation. This is not only wrong, but it's also a huge vulnerability in the right populist mindset. It's a button that, when pushed, produces a reliable and reflexive outrage. This is essential for the creation, maintenance and expansion of plutocracy. In a plutocracy, a small minority owns most of the property (we live in a plutocracy). By definition, plutocracy isn't popular, since it's a system that benefits a small minority at everyone else's expense. In its natural state, plutocracy is only popular with its winners, and not the vast majority of losers it creates. So plutocrats need to find ways to get turkeys to vote for Christmas. One important trick is to convince us all that the system is fair, guided by an invisible hand that performs mystic passes over our heads at birth and locates the very best of us and elevates us to the apex of the social pyramid. But there's a problem with this: plutocracy is self-sustaining. The story that we're all just \"temporarily embarrassed millionaires\" who can rise to the top with hard work and smarts falls flat in the face of the reality that nearly everyone at the top was born there. If the system selects rulers based on merit, and if everyone the system selects was born rich, then the rich must have some genetic trait that makes them destined to rule. This is why plutocracy always turns into aristocracy: the idea that some people are suited to rule because they have \"good blood.\" Eugenics is, above all, a way to excuse inequality. Fitness to rule is determined primarily by whose orifice you emerge from, and only secondarily by any obvious competence or skill. So right wing footsoldiers are mired in a terrible and shameful swamp of self-loathing. By definition, their lack of wealth and power is their own fault, and not merely their fault, but the fault of their genes. Being on the bottom is proof that you deserve to be there. Your failure to rise proves that you don't deserve to rise. No wonder the right is so irony-poisoned. Remember 2020, when gun-nuts got \"revenge\" on gun safety scolds by photographing themselves pointing loaded guns at their own penises? The participants insisted that they were just trolling, and they were&#8230;by pointing loaded guns at their dicks: https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/28/holographic-nano-layer-catalyser/#musketfuckers Plutocrats understand that there are limits to irony, and that at a certain point, irony poisoning becomes so acute that your rank-and-file literally start blowing their balls off. To relieve the pressure, plutes scapegoat other people based on their gender, sexual orientation, race, or nationality. This provides an important resolution to the cognitive dissonance of meritocracy. The reason you're doing so badly isn't that you lack merit, it's that affirmative action has elevated unworthy people to the positions that you deserve. You are a temporarily embarrassed millionaire &#8211; but the riches you deserve have been snaffled up by welfare queens and DEI consultants. Cruelty isn't the point of culture war bullshit: the point is power. Cruelty is merely the tactic: https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/09/turkeys-voting-for-christmas/#culture-wars Culture war bullshit is a very reliable way to get turkeys to vote for Christmas. Take the campaign against junk fees, which have ticketmastered every part of your life with \"fees\" for things like \"paying your rent by check\" and \"not paying your rent by check\": https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/30/military-industrial-park-service/#booz-allen There is no broad constituency for junk fees. Scam artists (including scam artists in the C-suites of Fortune 100 companies) love them, sure, but junk fees make everyone else furious. What's a plutocrat to do? Well, it turns out that culture war bullshit can make right wingers point (metaphorical) guns at their own junk &#8211; all plutocrats need to do is put the word out that getting rid of junk fees is \"woke\" and low-information right-wing thumbsuckers will demand the right to be charged junk fees. Here's an example: one especially pernicious form of junk fee is the \"swipe fees\" that credit-card companies charge merchants. In an increasingly cashless age, these companies &#8211; dominated by the Visa/Mastercard duopoly &#8211; have figured out how to scrape 3-5% out of every single retail transaction in the entire fucking economy. Every merchant you patronize has to charge more &#8211; or reduce quality, or both &#8211; in order to pay this Danegeld to two of the largest, most profitable companies in the world. Visa/Mastercard have hiked their fees by 40 percent since the pandemic's start. Forty. Fucking. Percent. Tell me again how greedflation isn't real? A bipartisan legislative coalition, led by Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) have proposed the Credit Card Competition Act (CCCA), which will force competition into credit-card routing, putting pressure on the Visa/Mastercard duopoly: https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1838/text?s=1&#38;amp;r=3 This should be a no-brainer, but plute spin-doctors have plenty of no-brains to fill up with culture war bullshit. Writing in The American Prospect, Luke Goldstein unpacks an astroturf campaign to save the endangered swipe fee from woke competition advocates: https://prospect.org/power/2023-08-04-wall-street-culture-war-swipe-fee-reform/ Now, this campaign isn't particularly sophisticated. It goes like this: Target is a big business that runs a lot of transactions through Visa/Mastercard, so it stands to benefit from competition in payment routing. And Target did a mean woke by selling Pride merch, which makes them groomers. So by fighting swipe fees, Congress is giving woke groomers a government bailout! It's literally that stupid. It's being pushed by a dark money group based in Kansas, which is targeting Senator Marshall's constituents with mailers that warns voters they'll \"lose their credit card points\" because he's thrown his lot in with \"liberal politicians\": https://punchbowl.news/caf-marshall-mailer-kansas/ The fliers also warn that competition could result in \"your financial data could be processed by partners of the Chinese Communist Party\" (the bill bans foreign companies from routing transactions, and bans China UnionPay by name). The fliers are anonymous. The only ghoul shameless enough to put his name on the campaign is Grover Nordquist, whose Americans for Tax Reform tells its Christmas-voting-turkeys to \"side with consumers, not woke retailers.\" The dark money org pushing this line have placed op-eds in newspapers across red states, comparing transaction routing competition to your kids' data being snaffled up by Tiktok: https://www.theflstandard.com/senators-rubio-and-scott-must-protect-the-personal-financial-data-of-floridians/ This nonsense was peddled by League of Southeastern Credit Unions president Samantha Beeler, whose org has spent $20,000 fighting the CCCA, claiming that a \"cheaper\" system would be \"less secure\": https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301493985.xml But that's small potatoes. Millions are being spent, right now, lobbying against CCCA &#8211; $5m from the American Bankers' Association, $2m from the Credit Union National Association, another $400k from Mastercard. For these rentiers, corrupting our government with millions is a stellar bargain if it lets them continue to collect rent every time we spend money. And millions of people who'll end up paying that will demand the right to do so, provided they're told that they're fighting \"woke capitalism\" and China.

Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Forcing your computer to rat you out (permalink) Powerful people imprisoned by the cluelessness of their own isolation, locked up with their own motivated reasoning: \"It's impossible to get a CEO to understand something when his quarterly earnings call depends on him not understanding it.\" Take Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg insists that anyone who wanted to use a pseudonym online is \"two-faced,\" engaged in dishonest social behavior. The Zuckerberg Doctrine claims that forcing people to use their own names is a way to ensure civility. This is an idea so radioactively wrong, it can be spotted from orbit. From the very beginning, social scientists (both inside and outside Facebook) told Zuckerberg that he was wrong. People have lots of reasons to hide their identities online, both good and bad, but a Real Names Policy affects different people differently: https://memex.craphound.com/2018/01/22/social-scientists-have-warned-zuck-all-along-that-the-facebook-theory-of-interaction-would-make-people-angry-and-miserable/ For marginalized and at-risk people, there are plenty of reasons to want to have more than one online identity &#8211; say, because you are a #MeToo whistleblower hoping that Harvey Weinstein won't sic his ex-Mossad mercenaries on you: https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies Or maybe you're a Rohingya Muslim hoping to avoid the genocidal attentions of the troll army that used Facebook to organize &#8211; under their real, legal names &#8211; to rape and murder you and everyone you love: https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/myanmar-facebooks-systems-promoted-violence-against-rohingya-meta-owes-reparations-new-report/ But even if no one is looking to destroy your life or kill you and your family, there are plenty of good reasons to present different facets of your identity to different people. No one talks to their lover, their boss and their toddler in exactly the same way, or reveals the same facts about their lives to those people. Maintaining different facets to your identity is normal and healthy &#8211; and the opposite, presenting the same face to everyone in your life, is a wildly terrible way to live. None of this is controversial among social scientists, nor is it hard to grasp. But Zuckerberg stubbornly stuck to this anonymity-breeds-incivility doctrine, even as dictators used the fact that Facebook forced dissidents to use their real names to retain power through the threat (and reality) of arrest and torture: https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/25/nationalize-moderna/#hun-sen Why did Zuck cling to this dangerous and obvious fallacy? Because the more he could collapse your identity into one unitary whole, the better he could target you with ads. Truly, it is impossible to get a billionaire to understand something when his mega-yacht depends on his not understanding it. This motivated reasoning ripples through all of Silicon Valley's top brass, producing what Anil Dash calls \"VC QAnon,\" the collection of conspiratorial, debunked and absurd beliefs embraced by powerful people who hold the digital lives of billions of us in their quivering grasp: https://www.anildash.com/2023/07/07/vc-qanon/ These fallacy-ridden autocrats like to disguise their demands as observations, as though wanting something to be true was the same as making it true. Think of when Eric Schmidt &#8211; then the CEO of Google &#8211; dismissed online privacy concerns, stating \"If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place\": https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/12/google-ceo-eric-schmidt-dismisses-privacy Schmidt was echoing the sentiments of his old co-conspirator, Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy: \"You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it\": https://www.wired.com/1999/01/sun-on-privacy-get-over-it/ Both men knew better. Schmidt, in particular, is very jealous of his own privacy. When Cnet reporters used Google to uncover and publish public (but intimate and personal) facts about Schmidt, Schmidt ordered Google PR to ignore all future requests for comment from Cnet reporters: https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/how-cnet-got-banned-by-google/ (Like everything else he does, Elon Musk's policy of responding to media questions about Twitter with a poop emoji is just him copying things other people thought up, making them worse, and taking credit for them:) https://www.theverge.com/23815634/tesla-elon-musk-origin-founder-twitter-land-of-the-giants Schmidt's actions do not reflect an attitude of \"If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.\" Rather, they are the normal response that we all have to getting doxed. When Schmidt and McNealy and Zuck tell us that we don't have privacy, or we don't want privacy, or that privacy is bad for us, they're disguising a demand as an observation. \"Privacy is dead\" actually means, \"When privacy is dead, I will be richer than you can imagine, so stop trying to save it, goddamnit.\" We are all prone to believing our own bullshit, but when a tech baron gets high on his own supply, his mental contortions have broad implications for all of us. A couple years after Schmidt's anti-privacy manifesto, Google launched Google Plus, a social network where everyone was required to use their \"real name.\" This decision &#8211; justified as a means of ensuring civility and a transparent ruse to improve ad targeting &#8211; kicked off the Nym Wars: https://epeus.blogspot.com/2011/08/google-plus-must-stop-this-identity.html One of the best documents to come out of that ugly conflict is \"Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names,\" a profound and surprising enumeration of all the ways that the experiences of tech bros in Silicon Valley are the real edge-cases, unreflective of the reality of billions of their users: https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/ This, in turn, spawned a whole genre of programmer-fallacy catalogs, falsehoods programmers believe about time, currency, birthdays, timezones, email addresses, national borders, nations, biometrics, gender, language, alphabets, phone numbers, addresses, systems of measurement, and, of course, families: https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood But humility is in short supply in tech. It's impossible to get a programmer to understand something when their boss requires them not to understand it. A programmer will happily insist that ordering you to remove your \"mask\" is for your own good &#8211; and not even notice that they're taking your skin off with it. There are so many ways that tech executives could improve their profits if only we would abandon our stubborn attachment to being so goddamned complicated. Think of Netflix and its anti-passsword-sharing holy war, which is really a demand that we redefine \"family\" to be legible and profitable for Netflix: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/02/nonbinary-families/#red-envelopes But despite the entreaties of tech companies to collapse our identities, our families, and our online lives into streamlined, computably hard-edged shapes that fit neatly into their database structures, we continue to live fuzzy, complicated lives that only glancingly resemble those of the executives seeking to shape them. Now, the rich, powerful people making these demands don't plan on being constrained by them. They are conservatives, in the tradition of #FrankWilhoit, believers in a system of \"in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect\": https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288 As with Schmidt's desire to spy on you from asshole to appetite for his own personal gain, and his violent aversion to having his own personal life made public, the tech millionaires and billionaires who made their fortune from the flexibility of general purpose computers would like to end that flexibility. They insist that the time for general purpose computers has passed, and that today, \"consumers\" crave the simplicity of appliances: https://memex.craphound.com/2012/01/10/lockdown-the-coming-war-on-general-purpose-computing/ It is in the War On General Purpose Computing that we find the cheapest and flimsiest rhetoric. Companies like Apple &#8211; and their apologists &#8211; insist that no one wants to use third-party app stores, or seek out independent repair depots &#8211; and then spend millions to make sure that it's illegal to jailbreak your phone or get it fixed outside of their own official channel: https://doctorow.medium.com/apples-cement-overshoes-329856288d13 The cognitive dissonance of \"no one wants this,\" and \"we must make it illegal to get this\" is powerful, but the motivated reasoning is more powerful still. It is impossible to get Tim Cook to understand something when his $49 million paycheck depends on him not understanding it. The War on General Purpose Computing has been underway for decades. Computers, like the people who use them, stubbornly insist on being reality-based, and the reality of computers is that they are general purpose. Every computer is a Turing complete, universal Von Neumann machine, which means that it can run every valid program. There is no way to get a computer to be almost Turing Complete, only capable of running programs that don't upset your shareholders' fragile emotional state. There is no such thing as a printer that will only run the \"reject third-party ink\" program. There is no such thing as a phone that will only run the \"reject third-party apps\" program. There are only laws, like the Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, that make writing and distributing those programs a felony punishable by a five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine (for a first offense). That is to say, the War On General Purpose Computing is only incidentally a technical fight: it is primarily a legal fight. When Apple says, \"You can't install a third party app store on your phone,\" what they means is, \"it's illegal to install that third party app store.\" It's not a technical countermeasure that stands between you and technological self-determination, it's a legal doctrine we can call \"felony contempt of business model\": https://locusmag.com/2020/09/cory-doctorow-ip/ But the mighty US government will not step in to protect a company's business model unless it at least gestures towards the technical. To invoke DMCA 1201, a company must first add the thinnest skin of digital rights management to their product. Since 1201 makes removing DRM illegal, a company can use this molecule-thick scrim of DRM to felonize any activity that the DRM prevents. More than 20 years ago, technologists started to tinker with ways to combine the legal and technical to tame the wild general purpose computer. Starting with Microsoft's Palladium project, they theorized a new \"Secure Computing\" model for allowing companies to reach into your computer long after you had paid for it and brought it home, in order to discipline you for using it in ways that undermined its shareholders' interest. Secure Computing began with the idea of shipping every computer with two CPUs. The first one was the normal CPU, the one you interacted with when you booted it up, loaded your OS, and ran programs. The second CPU would be a Trusted Platform Module, a brute-simple system-on-a-chip designed to be off-limits to modification, even by its owner (that is, you). The TPM would ship with a limited suite of simple programs it could run, each thoroughly audited for bugs, as well as secret cryptographic signing keys that you were not permitted to extract. The original plan called for some truly exotic physical security measures for that TPM, like an acid-filled cavity that would melt the chip if you tried to decap it or run it through an electron-tunneling microscope: https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/05/trusting-trust/#thompsons-devil This second computer represented a crack in the otherwise perfectly smooth wall of a computer's general purposeness; and Trusted Computing proposed to hammer a piton into that crack and use it to anchor a whole superstructure that could observe &#8211; and limited &#8211; the activity of your computer. This would start with observation: the TPM would observe every step of your computer's boot sequence, creating cryptographic hashes of each block of code as it loaded and executed. Each stage of the boot-up could be compared to \"known good\" versions of those programs. If your computer did something unexpected, the TPM could halt it in its tracks, blocking the boot cycle. What kind of unexpected things do computers do during their boot cycle? Well, if your computer is infected with malware, it might load poisoned versions of its operating system. Once your OS is poisoned, it's very hard to detect its malicious conduct, since normal antivirus programs rely on the OS to faithfully report what your computer is doing. When the AV program asks the OS to tell it which programs are running, or which files are on the drive, it has no choice but to trust the OS's response. When the OS is compromised, it can feed a stream of lies to users' programs, assuring these apps that everything is fine. That's a very beneficial use for a TPM, but there's a sinister flipside: the TPM can also watch your boot sequence to make sure that there aren't beneficial modifications present in your operating system. If you modify your OS to let you do things the manufacturer wants to prevent &#8211; like loading apps from a third-party app-store &#8211; the TPM can spot this and block it. Now, these beneficial and sinister uses can be teased apart. When the Palladium team first presented its research, my colleague Seth Schoen proposed an \"owner override\": a modification of Trusted Computing that would let the computer's owner override the TPM: https://web.archive.org/web/20021004125515/http://vitanuova.loyalty.org/2002-07-05.html This override would introduce its own risks, of course. A user who was tricked into overriding the TPM might expose themselves to malicious software, which could harm that user, as well as attacking other computers on the user's network and the other users whose data were on the compromised computer's drive. But an override would also provide serious benefits: it would rule out the monopolistic abuse of a TPM to force users to run malicious code that the manufacturer insisted on &#8211; code that prevented the user from doing things that benefited the user, even if it harmed the manufacturer's shareholders. For example, with owner override, Microsoft couldn't force you to use its official MS Office programs rather than third-party compatible programs like Apple's iWork or Google Docs or LibreOffice. Owner override also completely changed the calculus for another, even more dangerous part of Trusted Computing: remote attestation. Remote Attestation is a way for third parties to request a reliable, cryptographically secured assurances about which operating system and programs your computer is running. In Remote Attestation, the TPM in your computer observes every stage of your computer's boot, gathers information about all the programs you're running, and cryptographically signs them, using the signing keys the manufacturer installed during fabrication. You can send this \"attestation\" to other people on the internet. If they trust that your computer's TPM is truly secure, then they know that you have sent them a true picture of your computer's working (the actual protocol is a little more complicated and involves the remote party sending you a random number to cryptographically hash with the attestation, to prevent out-of-date attestations). Now, this is also potentially beneficial. If you want to make sure that your technologically unsophisticated friend is running an uncompromised computer before you transmit sensitive data to it, you can ask them for an attestation that will tell you whether they've been infected with malware. But it's also potentially very sinister. Your government can require all the computers in its borders to send a daily attestation to confirm that you're still running the mandatory spyware. Your abusive spouse &#8211; or abusive boss &#8211; can do the same for their own disciplinary technologies. Such a tool could prevent you from connecting to a service using a VPN, and make it impossible to use Tor Browser to protect your privacy when interacting with someone who wishes you harm. The thing is, it's completely normal and good for computers to lie to other computers on behalf of their owners. Like, if your IoT ebike's manufacturer goes out of business and all their bikes get bricked because they can no longer talk to their servers, you can run an app that tricks the bike into thinking that it's still talking to the mothership: https://nltimes.nl/2023/07/15/alternative-app-can-unlock-vanmoof-bikes-popular-amid-bankruptcy-fears Or if you're connecting to a webserver that tries to track you by fingerprinting you based on your computer's RAM, screen size, fonts, etc, you can order your browser to send random data about this stuff: https://jshelter.org/fingerprinting/ Or if you're connecting to a site that wants to track you and nonconsensually cram ads into your eyeballs, you can run an adblocker that doesn't show you the ads, but tells the site that it did: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/adblocking-how-about-nah Owner override leaves some of the beneficial uses of remote attestation intact. If you're asking a friend to remotely confirm that your computer is secure, you're not going to use an override to send them bad data about about your computer's configuration. And owner override also sweeps all of the malicious uses of remote attestation off the board. With owner override, you can tell any lie about your computer to a webserver, a site, your boss, your abusive spouse, or your government, and they can't spot the lie. But owner override also eliminates some beneficial uses of remote attestation. For example, owner override rules out remote attestation as a way for strangers to play multiplayer video games while confirming that none of them are using cheat programs (like aimhack). It also means that you can't use remote attestation to verify the configuration of a cloud server you're renting in order to assure yourself that it's not stealing your data or serving malware to your users. This is a tradeoff, and it's a tradeoff that's similar to lots of other tradeoffs we make online, between the freedom to do something good and the freedom to do something bad. Participating anonymously, contributing to free software, distributing penetration testing tools, or providing a speech platform that's open to the public all represent the same tradeoff. We have lots of experience with making the tradeoff in favor of restrictions rather than freedom: powerful bad actors are happy to attach their names to their cruel speech and incitement to violence. Their victims are silenced for fear of that retaliation. When we tell security researchers they can't disclose defects in software without the manufacturer's permission, the manufacturers use this as a club to silence their critics, not as a way to ensure orderly updates. When we let corporations decide who is allowed to speak, they act with a mixture of carelessness and self-interest, becoming off-the-books deputies of authoritarian regimes and corrupt, powerful elites. Alas, we made the wrong tradeoff with Trusted Computing. For the past twenty years, Trusted Computing has been creeping into our devices, albeit in somewhat denatured form. The original vision of acid-filled secondary processors has been replaced with less exotic (and expensive) alternatives, like \"secure enclaves.\" With a secure enclave, the manufacturer saves on the expense of installing a whole second computer, and instead, they draw a notional rectangle around a region of your computer's main chip and try really hard to make sure that it can only perform a very constrained set of tasks. This gives us the worst of all worlds. When secure enclaves are compromised, we not only lose the benefit of cryptographic certainty, knowing for sure that our computers are only booting up trusted, unalterted versions of the OS, but those compromised enclaves run malicious software that is essentially impossible to detect or remove: https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/28/descartes-was-an-optimist/#uh-oh But while Trusted Computing has wormed its way into boot-restrictions &#8211; preventing you from jailbreaking your computer so it will run the OS and apps of your choosing &#8211; there's been very little work on remote attestation&#8230;until now. Web Environment Integrity is Google's proposal to integrate remote attestation into everyday web-browsing. The idea is to allow web-servers to verify what OS, extensions, browser, and add-ons your computer is using before the server will communicate with you: https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md Even by the thin standards of the remote attestation imaginaries, there are precious few beneficial uses for this. The googlers behind the proposal have a couple of laughable suggestions, like, maybe if ad-supported sites can comprehensively refuse to serve ad-blocking browsers, they will invest the extra profits in making things you like. Or: letting websites block scriptable browsers will make it harder for bad people to auto-post fake reviews and comments, giving users more assurances about the products they buy. But foundationally, WEI is about compelling you to disclose true facts about yourself to people who you want to keep those facts from. It is a Real Names Policy for your browser. Google wants to add a new capability to the internet: the ability of people who have the power to force you to tell them things to know for sure that you're not lying. The fact that the authors assume this will be beneficial is just another \"falsehood programmers believe\": there is no good reason to hide the truth from other people. Squint a little and we're back to McNealy's \"Privacy is dead, get over it.\" Or Schmidt's \"If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.\" And like those men, the programmers behind this harebrained scheme don't imagine that it will ever apply to them. As Chris Palmer &#8211; who worked on Chromium &#8211; points out, this is not compatible with normal developer tools or debuggers, which are \"incalculably valuable and not really negotiable\": https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/Ux5h_kGO22g/m/5Lt5cnkLCwAJ This proposal is still obscure in the mainstream, but in tech circles, it has precipitated a flood of righteous fury: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/googles-web-integrity-api-sounds-like-drm-for-the-web/ As I wrote last week, giving manufacturers the power to decide how your computer is configured, overriding your own choices, is a bad tradeoff &#8211; the worst tradeoff, a greased slide into terminal enshittification: https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/24/rent-to-pwn/#kitt-is-a-demon This is how you get Unauthorized Bread: https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/ All of which leads to the question: what now? What should be done about WEI and remote attestation? Let me start by saying: I don't think it should be illegal for programmers to design and release these tools. Code is speech, and we can't understand how this stuff works if we can't study it. But programmers shouldn't deploy it in production code, in the same way that programmers should be allowed to make pen-testing tools, but shouldn't use them to attack production systems and harm their users. Programmers who do this should be criticized and excluded from the society of their ethical, user-respecting peers. Corporations that use remote attestation should face legal restrictions: privacy law should prevent the use of remote attestation to compel the production of true facts about users or the exclusion of users who refuse to produce those facts. Unfair competition law should prevent companies from using remote attestation to block interoperability or tie their products to related products and services. Finally, we must withdraw the laws that prevent users and programmers from overriding TPMs, secure enclaves and remote attestations. You should have the right to study and modify your computer to produce false attestations, or run any code of your choosing. Felony contempt of business model is an outrage. We should alter or strike down DMCA 1201, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and other laws (like contract law's \"tortious interference\") that stand between you and \"sole and despotic dominion\" over your own computer. All of that applies not just to users who want to reconfigure their own computers, but also toolsmiths who want to help them do so, by offering information, code, products or services to jailbreak and alter your devices. Tech giants will squeal at this, insisting that they serve your interests when they prevent rivals from opening up their products. After all, those rivals might be bad guys who want to hurt you. That's 100% true. What is likewise true is that no tech giant will defend you from its own bad impulses, and if you can't alter your device, you are powerless to stop them: https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar Companies should be stopped from harming you, but the right place to decide whether a business is doing something nefarious isn't in the boardroom of that company's chief competitor: it's in the halls of democratically accountable governments: https://www.eff.org/wp/interoperability-and-privacy So how do we get there? Well, that's another matter. In my next book, The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation (Verso Books, Sept 5), I lay out a detailed program, describing which policies will disenshittify the internet, and how to get those policies: https://www.versobooks.com/products/3035-the-internet-con Predictably, there are challenges getting this kind of book out into the world via our concentrated tech sector. Amazon refuses to carry the audio edition on its monopoly audiobook platform, Audible, unless it is locked to Amazon forever with mandatory DRM.

many subreddits[1] are going private for 48 hours in protest of reddit's API fee increase[2][3], which many expect will lead to the end of all third party apps.<p>I moderate a few subreddits for a niche hobby, and decided to join the protest. We're fairly small, if non-negligible potatos: altogether, maybe 10k-15k active users on a busy day, but still want to show support.<p>So, I commented to add the subs to the list[1] and made announcement posts based on the template[4] linked from r/modcoord.<p>Several minutes later, the site logged me out. I received an email from reddit that said my account had been locked for \"suspicious activity\" and I would need to reset my password.<p>The timing seemed curious, but as I was logged in over an Airbnb's wifi, I figured it could be legitimate.<p>When I logged back in, I saw that all of the posts and comments I've made from this account had been deleted.

There are sound environmental reasons not to jump just yet</p><p>Electric motoring is, in theory, a subject about which I should know something. My first university degree was in electrical and electronic engineering, with a subsequent master\u2019s in control systems. Combine this, perhaps surprising, academic pathway with a lifelong passion for the motorcar, and you can see why I was drawn into an early adoption of electric vehicles. I bought my first electric hybrid 18 years ago and my first pure electric car nine years ago and (notwithstanding our poor electric charging infrastructure) have enjoyed my time with both very much. Electric vehicles may be a bit soulless, but they\u2019re wonderful mechanisms: fast, quiet and, until recently, very cheap to run. But increasingly, I feel a little duped. When you start to drill into the facts, electric motoring doesn\u2019t seem to be quite the environmental panacea it is claimed to be.</p><p>As you may know, the government has proposed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/18/uk-ban-on-new-fossil-fuel-vehicles-by-2030-not-enough-to-hit-climate-targets\">ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars</a> from 2030. The problem with the initiative is that it seems to be based on conclusions drawn from only one part of a car\u2019s operating life: what comes out of the exhaust pipe. Electric cars, of course, have zero exhaust emissions, which is a welcome development, particularly in respect of the air quality in city centres. But if you zoom out a bit and look at a bigger picture that includes the car\u2019s manufacture, the situation is very different. In advance of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow in 2021, Volvo released figures claiming that greenhouse gas emissions during production of an electric car are<a href=\"https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/cars/article-10161697/Volvo-says-electric-car-making-emissions-70-HIGHER-petrol.html\"> 70% higher</a> than when manufacturing a petrol one. How so? The problem lies with the lithium-ion batteries fitted currently to nearly all electric vehicles: they\u2019re absurdly heavy, many rare earth metals and huge amounts of energy are required to make them, and they only last about 10 years. It seems a perverse choice of hardware with which to lead the automobile\u2019s fight against the climate crisis.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/03/electric-vehicles-early-adopter-petrol-car-ev-environment-rowan-atkinson\">Continue reading...</a>", "source_obj__id": 340, "page_rating_votes": 10, "date_published": "2023-06-03T07:00:24+00:00", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "comments": [], "album": null, "thumbnail": null, "dead": false, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating": 10, "age": null, "title": "I love electric vehicles \u2013 and was an early adopter.

id=\"nd1ViS\">Watching YouTube on your TV is about to get more frustrating if you\u2019re not paying to avoid ads. As announced at the <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/brandcast-2023-highlights-trends/\">YouTube Brandcast</a> event on Wednesday, YouTube will soon add 30-second unskippable ads to top-performing content watched on connected TVs. </p>\n<p id=\"QSiZHN\">YouTube says viewers will see a single 30-second ad instead of two consecutive 15-second ads, though that doesn\u2019t mean that those shorter ads will be disappearing entirely. 30-second ads will be available to advertisers via <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/ads/introducing-youtube-select/\">YouTube Select</a>, a curated advertising platform that targets the top five percent of YouTube content. YouTube claims 70 percent of YouTube Select impressions come from TVs, making it the ideal platform for longer ads.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"WUr9mK\"><q>YouTube is also testing ads that will appear on...</q></aside></div>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/18/23728150/youtube-tv-unskippable-ads-premium-pause-commercial\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>", "source_obj__id": 359, "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2023-05-18T09:26:22+00:00", "source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "comments": [], "album": null, "thumbnail": null, "dead": false, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating": 0, "age": 0, "title": "YouTube is bringing unskippable 30-second ads to TV", "artist": null, "vote": 0, "bookmarked": true}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["lgbt", "paedophilia"], "language": "en-US", "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 0, "link": "https://nyadagbladet-se.translate.goog/inrikes/homosajten-qruisers-grundare-doms-for-sexualbrott-mot-13-barn/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=pl&_x_tr_hl=en-GB", "description": "Za\u0142o\u017cyciel serwisu gejowskiego Cruiser zosta\u0142 skazany za przest\u0119pstwa seksualne wobec 13 dzieci", "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2023-05-18T07:07:01+00:00", "source": "https://nyadagbladet-se.translate.goog", "comments": [], "album": null, "thumbnail": null, "dead": false, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating": 0, "age": 0, "title": "Za\u0142o\u017cyciel serwisu gejowskiego Cruiser zosta\u0142 skazany za przest\u0119pstwa seksualne wobec 13 dzieci", "artist": null, "vote": 0, "bookmarked": true}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["selfhost", "google analytics"], "language": "en", "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 0, "link": "https://requestmetrics.com/feature/session-transcripts", "description": "Session Transcripts | Dive deep into individual user sessions with fast, informative, and privacy-conscious transcripts. | Request Metrics", "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2023-05-18T04:54:44+00:00", "source": "https://requestmetrics.com", "comments": [], "album": null, "thumbnail": null, "dead": false, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating": 0, "age": 0, "title": "Session Transcripts | Dive deep into individual user sessions with fast, informative, and privacy-conscious transcripts. | Request Metrics", "artist": null, "vote": 0, "bookmarked": true}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["artificial intelligence"], "language": "en-US", "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 0, "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35983824", "description": "<p>I've found it increasingly hard to get useful information out of ChatGPT.

But is it? Because just after Microsoft\u2019s initial investment in 2019, OpenAI legally restructured from a non-profit company to a \u201ccapped\u201d for-profit company, with ongoing collaborations exclusively with Microsoft.\nSo, how did we get here? Why did OpenAI go from a non-profit for humanity to a for-profit that's heavily intertwined with Microsoft? And what has OpenAI accomplished?\nWell in this video, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to talk about, and a whole lot more. From the founders, to the technological research and achievements, the products and funding, and how their mission has shifted overtime.\nThis is The Untold Story of OpenAI.\n\n------------------------\n\n\ud83d\udc31\u200d\ud83d\ude80 GitHub: https://github.com/forrestknight\n\ud83d\udc26 Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/forrestpknight\n\ud83d\udcbc LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/forrestpknight\n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/forrestpknight\n \n\ud83d\udcd3 Learning Resources: \nMy Favorite Machine Learning Course:  https://imp.i384100.net/YgYEBJ\nOpen Source Computer Science Degree:  https://bit.ly/open-source-forrest\nPython Open Source Computer Science Degree:  https://bit.ly/python-open-source\nUdacity to Learn Any Coding Skill: http://bit.ly/udacity-forrest\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb My Coding Gear:\nMy NAS Server: https://amzn.to/3brqO7b\nMy Hard Drives: https://amzn.to/3aKetMi\nMy Main Monitor: https://amzn.to/3siQfPa\nMy Second Monitor: https://amzn.to/3keHT84\nMy Standing Desk: https://amzn.to/3boAcbC\nMy PC Build:  https://bit.ly/my-coding-gear\nMy AI GPU: https://amzn.to/3uvmUmz", "source_obj__id": 118, "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2023-04-04T13:00:36+00:00", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2WHjPDvbE6O328n17ZGcfg", "comments": [], "album": null, "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/o07kRSvz7yM/hqdefault.jpg", "dead": false, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating": 0, "age": 0, "title": "The Untold Story of OpenAI: Microsoft's Takeover", "artist": null, "vote": 0, "bookmarked": true}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["web30", "artificial intelligence", "internet"], "language": "en-US", "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 1, "link": "https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/04/1070938/we-are-hurtling-toward-a-glitchy-spammy-scammy-ai-powered-internet", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/04/1070938/we-are-hurtling-toward-a-glitchy-spammy-scammy-ai-powered-internet/\">https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/04/1070938/we-are-hurtling-toward-a-glitchy-spammy-scammy-ai-powered-internet/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35438318\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35438318</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "source_obj__id": 141, "page_rating_votes": 70, "date_published": "2023-04-04T12:11:05+00:00", "source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "comments": [], "album": null, "thumbnail": "https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/torn-llms3.jpeg?resize=1200,600", "dead": false, "page_rating_contents": 52, "page_rating": 122, "age": 0, "title": "We are hurtling toward a glitchy, spammy, scammy, AI-powered internet", "artist": null, "vote": 70, "bookmarked": true}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["christianophobia"], "language": "en-US", "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 0, "link": "https://www.newsweek.com/acceptable-hate-assaults-christianity-go-overlooked-opinion-1791866", "description": "Following the tragic events in Nashville, left-wing columnists, entertainers, and activists directed their ire toward Christians.", "source_obj__id": 238, "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2023-04-04T10:00:01+00:00", "source": "https://www.newsweek.com/rss", "comments": [], "album": null, "thumbnail": null, "dead": false, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating": 0, "age": 0, "title": "Acceptable Hate: Assaults on Christianity Go Overlooked | Opinion", "artist": null, "vote": 0, "bookmarked": true}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["george soros", "donald trump", "the right wing"], "language": "en-US", "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 0, "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/04/us/politics/george-soros-bragg-trump.html", "description": "Conspiracy theorists have long attributed wildly varied events to George Soros, in attacks often viewed as antisemitic.

There are articles being written, social media going crazy, and comments on seemingly every one of my YouTube videos. And when I made my video about ChatGPT, I had two particular comments that stuck out to me. One was that someone wished I had included my opinion about AI in that video, and the other was asking if AI will make programmers obsolete in 5 years. This video is to do just that. And after learning, researching, and using many different AI tools over the last many months (a video about those tools coming soon), well let\u2019s just say I have many thoughts on this topic. What AI can do for programmers right now. How it\u2019s looking to progress in the near future. And will it make programmers obsolete in the next 5 years?

The planned features are the following: video, encrypted direct messages, longform tweets, Blue Verified program, and payments.\n\nIt would mean there's a big incentive to use Twitter for all of these things: as a creator, why would I use different platforms for my videos, my articles and my social posts if I can use my Twitter following for everything?\n\nAs a general user, I can just follow the people I like in one single place, no need to use ten apps to see everything. And since I'm already there for the videos and articles and tweets, why not also use the DMs in here, instead of using a separate app? And at that point, the payment feature makes sense, and since I setup a payment method, why not use Twitter to pay in real life as well?\n\nAnd on paper, it looks kinda cool, but we're faced with a bunch of big problems.\n\nThe first issue is control. If everyone uses Twitter for their social network needs, for their videos, payment, article reading, day to day messaging, then Twitter controls MAJOR parts of the internet.\n\nThey control communications, with all your DMs and group conversations, and all the day to day background noise that is social media. They control monetary exchanges between people and between people and various stores or websites. And they control the content people watch and read, with articles and videos.\n\nOf course, there's another problem, a privacy problem. Yeah, since everything you do is in one single application, this also means your profile in this specific app is incredibly big and valuable to advertisers.\n\nImagine this goldmine: Twitter would know which companies you follow, what you liked, who you talked to, what article you read, which videos you watched, which contacts you talk to the most, what you talk about with these contacts, who you send money to, what you buy online, or even in real life.\n\nThere's also a security issue. With that amount of data available on so many people, Twitter becomes a big, big target for hackers. Sure, they want to encrypt the DMs, but no encryption is invulnerable, and the rest of the data might be accessible. They could access the information users supplied to be verified, they could access payment history, or use the data to launch disinformation campaigns.\n\nBut, fortunately, this vision will probably not happen. Because the elephant in the room is WeChat: WeChat IS the everything app for China. But WeChat managed to lock people into these features because they didn't really exist outside of wechat before. \n\nTwitter becoming an everything app doesn't solve any problems people have. Everything this new vision offers is already available, and the other options are already very popular. \n\nSo, fortunately, the Twitter 2.0 vision is probably not going to be the all in one app that takes over everything else, because if people don't have a strong incentive to use it instead of what they already use, it won't work. And Twitter adding these features isn't a strong incentive.\n\nFacebook tried again and again to be the everything app. Twitter 2.0 is nothing new, it's what Facebook has been trying to accomplish since its creation.", "source_obj__id": 349, "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2023-03-01T18:19:46+00:00", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC5UAwBUum7CPN5buc-_N1Fw", "comments": [], "album": null, "thumbnail": null, "dead": false, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating": 0, "age": 0, "title": "Twitter 2 0 is a BAD idea: why the \"Everything App\" is a nightmare.", "artist": null, "vote": 0, "bookmarked": true}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["amazon", "corporatocracy", "biometric"], "language": "en-US", "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 0, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Orc9G5DbiCg", "description": "Amazon buys telehealth service One Medical.\n\nWatch the full WAN Show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FqH1rqQrQg\n\n\u25ba GET MERCH: https://lttstore.com\n\u25ba LTX 2023 TICKETS AVAILABLE NOW: https://lmg.gg/ltx23\n\u25ba GET EXCLUSIVE CONTENT ON FLOATPLANE: https://lmg.gg/lttfloatplane\n\u25ba SPONSORS, AFFILIATES, AND PARTNERS: https://lmg.gg/partners\n\u25ba OUR WAN PODCAST GEAR: https://lmg.gg/wanset\n \nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL\n---------------------------------------------------  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/linustech\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/LinusTech\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/linustech\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@linustech\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/linustech", "source_obj__id": 182, "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2023-03-01T17:00:30+00:00", "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCFLFc8Lpbwt4jPtY1_Ai5yA", "comments": [], "album": null, "thumbnail": null, "dead": false, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating": 0, "age": 0, "title": "Dr.  Amazon will see you now", "artist": null, "vote": 0, "bookmarked": true}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["lockdown files", "covid"], "language": "en-US", "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 0, "link": "https://dailysceptic.org/2023/03/01/hancocks-lockdown-files-show-there-was-no-plandemic", "description": "<p>The 'Lockdown Files' confirm that there was no 'plandemic'.

I also occasionally use it to split dinner with friends. I don't use it for business and I don't use it for anything sketchy.<p>I recently received an email from PayPal saying that my account had been permanently banned. No appeal, no reason given. I logged in separately to make sure this was a real email, at first I thought it must be phishing. It was real.<p>The only thing I can think of which might have precipitated this. I got a few invoice requests though PayPal a while ago from people/businesses I had never heard of. This is a well known and documented scam where they spam invoices en-masse and hope some people pay them accidentally (I did not pay them, but the PayPal UI makes this very easy to do and there is no way to decline or dismiss the requests).<p>Not a big deal for me since I don't use PayPal for anything critical, but I figured a reminder was in order in case anyone still thinks it won't happen to them.

It's also the search engines from these companies that will dictate which websites surface, and which don't. The algorithms from the platforms you use, like youtube for video, Facebook, or Twitter will define what content you see, and what content you don't.\n\nAnd then you have the lack of interoperability between services. But this stuff, you can still bypass yourself. More concerning is what countries do to limit what you can and can't access. \n\nhttps://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/internet-censorship-map/\n\nCountries implement various filters that are basically censorship. Some of it is acceptable, like blocking illegal material, and some of it is more questionable, like blocking websites that reference various copyrighted materials.\n\nAll these filters make the internet less open: you can't freely access what you're looking for if your country decides it's not allowed.\n\nWhen filters aren't enough, countries now implement full internet blackouts, generally to deal with protests against the government's actions. In 2020, 268 million people had their internet access shut down, that's 49% more than in 2019.\n\nWhile these blackouts are selective, and can still let governments access the internet themselves while the general public can't, they're devastating for a country's economy and business, and they can't be maintained for very long periods of time.\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/the-global-economic-damage-of-internet-blackouts/503093/\n\nhttps://news.yahoo.com/268-million-people-had-internet-122208785.html\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/iran-internet-blackout-economy/\n\nNow, the ultimate candidate against the open web is what China has built. They might be linked to the general internet everybody else enjoys, but it's a one way street: people can access their websites, but Chinese people can't access most of the rest of the internet, being limited to what the Chinese government allows.\n\nChina has built their own entire alternative internet, with their own services and their own websites, and it's not for nothing that we're talking about the great firewall of china, because when you're in there, you can't access anything the government has deemed \"not ok\".\n\nhttps://priteshpawar.com/chinese-alternatives-to-popular-apps-and-websites/tech-industry-and-case-studies/priteshpawar/\n that it would be a grave mistake to let their citizens have access to information sources that \n\nOf course, it's not all doom and gloom. The internet is showing signs of healing, at least on certain fronts.\n\nFirst, decentralized services are emerging again, slowly offering alternatives to the big closed down networks.

Product information, including prices and customer ratings, is displayed on screens that update in real time to reflect online price changes.

Instead, they work by teaching our cells to make a harmless piece of a \u201cspike protein,\u201d which is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. After making the protein piece, cells display it on their surface. Our immune system then recognizes that it does not belong there and responds to get rid of it. When an immune response begins, antibodies are produced, creating the same response that happens in a natural infection.\nIn contrast to mRNA vaccines, many other vaccines use a piece of, or weakened version of, the germ that the vaccine protects against. This is how the measles and flu vaccines work. When a weakened or small part of the virus is introduced to your body, you make antibodies to help protect against future infection. Both messenger RNA (mRNA) and viral vector COVID-19 vaccines work by delivering instructions (genetic material) to our cells to start building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19.\nAfter the body produces an immune response, it discards all the vaccine ingredients just as it would discard any information that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning.\nThe genetic material delivered by mRNA vaccines never enters the nucleus of your cells, which is where your DNA is kept. Viral vector COVID-19 vaccines deliver genetic material to the cell nucleus to allow our cells to build protection against COVID-19. However, the vector virus does not have the machinery needed to integrate its genetic material into our DNA, so it cannot alter our DNA. According to the CDC all COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States are effective at preventing COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can offer some protection from future illness, sometimes called \u201cnatural immunity,\u201d but the level of protection people get from having COVID-19 may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age.\nGetting a COVID-19 vaccination is also a safer way to build protection than getting sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without you having to experience sickness. Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can cause severe illness or death, and we can\u2019t reliably predict who will have mild or severe illness. If you get sick, you can spread COVID-19 to others. You can also continue to have long-term health issues after COVID-19 infection.\nWhile COVID-19 vaccines are effective, studies have shown some declines in vaccine effectiveness against infections over time, especially when the Delta variant was circulating widely.\n\nAbout Rising: \nRising is a weekday morning show with bipartisan hosts that breaks the mold of morning TV by taking viewers inside the halls of Washington power like never before.

HN! I've been working on a code editor and I think that it's mature enough to catch some interest. It's using a custom GPU accelerated GUI written in C++. Currently implements some interesting features: LSP, terminal, auto-completion, linters, formatters, custom keybindings, plugins and more. It's a hobby project but still intends to be an alternative to other popular code editors like Sublime, Kate, Lapce, Lite XL (and takes inspiration from them).\nThe project was born as a playground for the GUI I'm developing (eepp GUI) and is advanced enough to currently be my main code editor, but it's a work in progress, and many features are still pending.\nSome minor hints on how to use it:\nFolders are used as project (and .gitignore is used to ignore files)\nThe wheel icon on the top-right has all the options you need (Ctrl/Cmd + M to show).\nSome keybidings to navigate any project (navigation is keyboard driven):\nCtrl/Cmd + K = Locate Files\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + F = Global Search\nCtrl/Cmd + Number (Go to tab #)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

One could argue a few too many Krispy Kremes can also be \"dangerous.\"  </p><p>Many complaints centered on Peterson's criticism of transgenderism. One complainant said, \"he has failed to advocate for the autonomy and dignity of transgendered persons.\" <br /></p><p>Last June, Peterson's Twitter account was suspended after he tweeted, \"Remember when pride was a sin? And Ellen Page just had her breasts removed by a criminal physician.\" Where is the lie, though?</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cOkay, so now you can get banned for calling people by their name? @jordanbpeterson just got suspended from Twitter for writing that Ellen Page removed her breasts.

One complainant actually submitted the entire transcript of Peterson's 3-hour appearance on Joe Rogan. </p><p>In conclusion, the College of Ontario Psychologists essentially created a highlight reel of Jordan's Twitter. I honestly forgot just how cool he is until I read this document. </p><p>Peterson said he will ignore the paperwork that came with each complaint because it's too time-consuming. He submitted an application for judicial review to the Ontario Divisional Court.

second tech giant today to receive a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-eu-fine-personalized-ads-163403318.html\">fine over personalized ads</a>. France's National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL) has <a href=\"https://www.cnil.fr/fr/identifiant-publicitaire-sanction-de-8-millions-deuros-lencontre-de-apple-distribution-international\">issued</a> an \u20ac8 million (roughly $8.5 million) penalty over allegations Apple automatically collected identifying data from App Store visitors using iOS 14.6 without their permission, helping the company target ads. The firm was profiting from violations of data protection law, according to officials.</p><p>You could turn off the ad targeting, but it was enabled by default and couldn't be disabled without wading through multiple menu levels, CNIL added. That reportedly made it impossible for users to give proper consent. Apple has since changed its practices, and CNIL said it conducted &quot;several&quot; checks between 2021 and 2022 to make sure the company was honoring data rules. France launched its investigation in March 2021.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>We've asked Apple for comment. As <em>9to5Mac</em> noted, Apple told <em>Financial Times</em>' Patrick McGee in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PatrickMcGee_/status/1610691371836510209\">statement</a> that it was &quot;disappointed&quot; with the decision and planned an appeal. The iPhone maker argued that its Search Ads system went &quot;further&quot; than any rival in offering choice over targeted ads, and didn't track user cross third-party apps or websites.</p><p>Apple has had a contentious relationship with French regulators. In 2020, the country's competition authority issued a fine equivalent to $1.2 billion (now <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-wins-appeal-lower-antitrust-fine-in-france-094034302.html\">down to $364.6 million</a>) for alleged antitrust abuses in its distribution chain. The company also received a $27.3 million fine over <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-07-france-apple-ios-slowdown-fine.html\">iPhone performance throttling</a> that same year. While the French government defended Apple's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/french-companies-fail-in-bid-to-limit-apples-i-os-14-tracking-protections-121521004.html\">iOS 14 anti-tracking measures</a> against industry pressure, it's evident that the brand remains under close scrutiny.</p>", "source_obj__id": 104, "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2023-01-04T21:17:50+00:00", "source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "comments": [], "album": null, "thumbnail": null, "dead": false, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating": 0, "age": 0, "title": "Apple fined $8.5 million in France over targeted App Store ads", "artist": null, "vote": 0, "bookmarked": true}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["twitter files"], "language": "en-US", "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 0, "link": "https://reclaimthenet.org/adam-schiff-twitter-ban-paul-sperry", "description": "<a href=\"https://reclaimthenet.org/adam-schiff-twitter-ban-paul-sperry/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Rep.

"<p><span>\n\nAn </span>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/giving-up-on-privacy\">old privacy post</a> of mine\nrecently got a lot of discussion \n\n<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34173058\">on Hacker\nNews</a>.  It seems people took me to be saying something like:\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\nOther people are foolish to be worried about privacy.  If there's\nanything you don't want public it's probably because you're doing\nsomething you shouldn't.  The decrease in privacy over time will be\ngreat for everyone once we adapt to it, and has no downsides.\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nTo be clear, this isn't (and wasn't) my view.  There are a lot\nof situations in which it makes sense for someone to take careful\nsteps to preserve various forms of privacy, there are things\npeople wouldn't want public for very good reasons, and decreasing\nprivacy has real harms.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nBut I also think it's very risky to rely on privacy. Many ordinary\nthings we do expose more than we probably expect.  What could someone\ninfer from the timing of your posts or messages? Background details in\npictures?  Cell tower logs of your movements?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOne of the major effects of increasing technology has been decreasing\nprivacy.  Cheap fast computers and storage make many things possible\nat massive scale that would have been infeasible before.  For example,\ncars have had license plates for a century but it wouldn't have been\npractical to use them to build up a detailed record of traffic at\nlarge. Banknotes have (always?) had serial numbers, but people\nreceiving bills didn't check them, record them, or use them to build\nup a record of how cash moves around our society.  People have\n(always!) had faces, but looking through the enormous number of\npublished photos to pick out ones with your face wasn't practical.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAnother way that technology offers the opportunity for reduced privacy\nis that more interactions happen via computer, where they can easily\nbe logged and categorized.  For example, when I visit a typical web\npage, many <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/why-i-work-on-ads\">trackers record this\nvisit</a>, and connect it to other pages I've visited.  Similarly,\nmost of my communication with others is now via text on computers,\nwhich is quite amenable to automated analysis.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI expect this trend to continue: computers are continuing to get\nsmaller, cheaper, and faster.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)\">Transformers</a>\nhave turned out to be incredibly capable. People building things that\ncollect and correlate this information are still adapting to the\ntechnology of several years ago, let alone what's still coming out.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOn the other hand, there are some trends in the other direction.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_law\">Privacy\nlegislation</a>, really taking off with Europe's 2016 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\">GDPR</a>\n(effective 2018), has made some forms of data collection and\nprocessing require the consent of the people it's about.  I haven't\nfound great polling on people's level of privacy concerns over time,\nbut the small amount I have found does <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/232319/facebook-users-privacy-concerns-2011.aspx\">show\nan increase</a>.  Technology options that make sacrifices for the sake\nof user privacy (<a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/\">DDG</a>, <a href=\"https://signal.org/en/\">Signal</a>, etc) are growing, though\nfrom a small base (and <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/\">Firefox</a> is\ndeclining, down to 3% from a peak of 32%).\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhere does this leave us?  Several thoughts:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>Despite the changes in sentiment and regulation around privacy,\nI don't think a private future is something we can count on. I think\nit's more likely than not that systems that can wring a great deal of\nmeaning out of everything everyone has done publicly are wildly\ndeployed during our lifetimes, probably within the next ten years.\nHacks, leaks, and blunders that expose information you trusted others\nto keep private are also going to be a continuing fact of life,\naccelerated by digitization.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Since we can't trust the future to keep things private, my\ngeneral approach to privacy is still to treat even nominally private\nthings as if they might become public, and act accordingly.\nHabitually making things public is one way to make this a lower\nburden, and is one which has some advantages (better feedback from\nothers, sharing information others can benefit from, etc).\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Efforts to promote a more private future, through technology or\nregulation, <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/effective-altruism-and-everyday-decisions\">individual\nchoice</a> or professional work, may or may not be worth it depending\non how you view the chances of success and the benefits if successful.\nI think this is very unlikely to beat work on things like 80k's <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\">most pressing\nproblems</a>, but I expect some people have high enough estimates on\nthe value of privacy work (ex: risk of <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/risks-of-stable-totalitarianism/\">stable\ntotalitarianism</a>, suppression of important but unpopular ideas)\nthat they'll disagree.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n  \n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02DpMpuBhcWADecdkXHBdz6E2if3R8WA8F9NXzoj4v4GWQxRS6AEenzuiQGSpmf8aCl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/GZ65zECCikbA29m8f\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109621520793839169\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "source_obj__id": 163, "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2023-01-02T08:00:00+00:00", "source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "comments": [], "album": null, "thumbnail": null, "dead": false, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating": 0, "age": 0, "title": "Preparing for Less Privacy", "artist": null, "vote": 0, "bookmarked": true}, {"permanent": false, "tags": ["vaccine", "covid"], "language": "pl-PL", "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 0, "link": "https://www.money.pl/gospodarka/jest-szczepionkowa-ugoda-pierwszy-producent-wstrzymuje-dostawy-6851139086457696a.html", "description": "<img src=\"https://i.wpimg.pl/308x/filerepo.grupawp.pl/api/v1/display/embed/18c7e167-206f-4fa5-989d-0221fca6ddc6\" width=\"308\" /> Pierwszy sukces Polski w negocjacjach z koncernami farmaceutycznymi.
