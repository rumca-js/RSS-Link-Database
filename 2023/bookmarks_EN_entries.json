One complainant actually submitted the entire transcript of Peterson's 3-hour appearance on Joe Rogan. </p><p>In conclusion, the College of Ontario Psychologists essentially created a highlight reel of Jordan's Twitter. I honestly forgot just how cool he is until I read this document. </p><p>Peterson said he will ignore the paperwork that came with each complaint because it's too time-consuming. He submitted an application for judicial review to the Ontario Divisional Court.  He also said he will not complete the social media coaching mandated by the college, which would be at his own expense and cost up to $225 an hour. </p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

It seems people took me to be saying something like:\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\nOther people are foolish to be worried about privacy.  If there's\nanything you don't want public it's probably because you're doing\nsomething you shouldn't.  The decrease in privacy over time will be\ngreat for everyone once we adapt to it, and has no downsides.\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nTo be clear, this isn't (and wasn't) my view.  There are a lot\nof situations in which it makes sense for someone to take careful\nsteps to preserve various forms of privacy, there are things\npeople wouldn't want public for very good reasons, and decreasing\nprivacy has real harms.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nBut I also think it's very risky to rely on privacy. Many ordinary\nthings we do expose more than we probably expect.  What could someone\ninfer from the timing of your posts or messages? Background details in\npictures?  Cell tower logs of your movements?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOne of the major effects of increasing technology has been decreasing\nprivacy.  Cheap fast computers and storage make many things possible\nat massive scale that would have been infeasible before.  For example,\ncars have had license plates for a century but it wouldn't have been\npractical to use them to build up a detailed record of traffic at\nlarge. Banknotes have (always?) had serial numbers, but people\nreceiving bills didn't check them, record them, or use them to build\nup a record of how cash moves around our society.  People have\n(always!) had faces, but looking through the enormous number of\npublished photos to pick out ones with your face wasn't practical.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAnother way that technology offers the opportunity for reduced privacy\nis that more interactions happen via computer, where they can easily\nbe logged and categorized.  For example, when I visit a typical web\npage, many <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/why-i-work-on-ads\">trackers record this\nvisit</a>, and connect it to other pages I've visited.  Similarly,\nmost of my communication with others is now via text on computers,\nwhich is quite amenable to automated analysis.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI expect this trend to continue: computers are continuing to get\nsmaller, cheaper, and faster.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)\">Transformers</a>\nhave turned out to be incredibly capable. People building things that\ncollect and correlate this information are still adapting to the\ntechnology of several years ago, let alone what's still coming out.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOn the other hand, there are some trends in the other direction.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_law\">Privacy\nlegislation</a>, really taking off with Europe's 2016 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\">GDPR</a>\n(effective 2018), has made some forms of data collection and\nprocessing require the consent of the people it's about.  I haven't\nfound great polling on people's level of privacy concerns over time,\nbut the small amount I have found does <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/232319/facebook-users-privacy-concerns-2011.aspx\">show\nan increase</a>.  Technology options that make sacrifices for the sake\nof user privacy (<a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/\">DDG</a>, <a href=\"https://signal.org/en/\">Signal</a>, etc) are growing, though\nfrom a small base (and <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/\">Firefox</a> is\ndeclining, down to 3% from a peak of 32%).\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhere does this leave us?  Several thoughts:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>Despite the changes in sentiment and regulation around privacy,\nI don't think a private future is something we can count on. I think\nit's more likely than not that systems that can wring a great deal of\nmeaning out of everything everyone has done publicly are wildly\ndeployed during our lifetimes, probably within the next ten years.\nHacks, leaks, and blunders that expose information you trusted others\nto keep private are also going to be a continuing fact of life,\naccelerated by digitization.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Since we can't trust the future to keep things private, my\ngeneral approach to privacy is still to treat even nominally private\nthings as if they might become public, and act accordingly.\nHabitually making things public is one way to make this a lower\nburden, and is one which has some advantages (better feedback from\nothers, sharing information others can benefit from, etc).\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Efforts to promote a more private future, through technology or\nregulation, <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/effective-altruism-and-everyday-decisions\">individual\nchoice</a> or professional work, may or may not be worth it depending\non how you view the chances of success and the benefits if successful.\nI think this is very unlikely to beat work on things like 80k's <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\">most pressing\nproblems</a>, but I expect some people have high enough estimates on\nthe value of privacy work (ex: risk of <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/risks-of-stable-totalitarianism/\">stable\ntotalitarianism</a>, suppression of important but unpopular ideas)\nthat they'll disagree.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n  \n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02DpMpuBhcWADecdkXHBdz6E2if3R8WA8F9NXzoj4v4GWQxRS6AEenzuiQGSpmf8aCl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/GZ65zECCikbA29m8f\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109621520793839169\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "persistent": true, "language": "en-US", "user": "rumpel", "tags": ["privacy"]}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/02/third-of-world-economy-to-hit-recession-in-2023-imf-head-warns", "title": "Third of world economy to hit recession in 2023, IMF head warns", "date_published": "2023-01-02 04:22:14+00:00", "description": "<p>China\u2019s lagging growth a key threat this year, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said, while the US is \u2018most resilient.\u2019</p><p>For much of the global economy, 2023 is going to be a tough year as the main engines of global growth \u2013 the US, Europe and China \u2013 all experience weakening activity, the head of the International Monetary Fund has warned.</p><p>The new year is going to be \u201ctougher than the year we leave behind,\u201d IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said on the CBS Sunday morning news program <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/full-interview-imf-managing-director-kristalina-georgieva-on-face-the-nation-with-margaret-brennan/\">Face the Nation</a> on Sunday.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/02/third-of-world-economy-to-hit-recession-in-2023-imf-head-warns\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": true, "language": "en-US", "user": "rumpel", "tags": []}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "link": "https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2022/dec/27/mortal-kombat-2-source-leak/", "title": "Mortal Kombat 2 source code leak reveals unused animations and sprites", "date_published": "2023-01-02 03:43:58+00:00", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2022/dec/27/mortal-kombat-2-source-leak/\">https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2022/dec/27/mortal-kombat-2-source-leak/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34214022\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34214022</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "persistent": true, "language": "en-US", "user": "rumpel", "tags": []}, {"source": "https://levelup-edu.com", "link": "https://levelup-edu.com/bezos-gates-zuckerberg-behind-every-self-made-millionaire-is-a-father-with-money/", "title": "Bezos, Gates, Zuckerberg.
