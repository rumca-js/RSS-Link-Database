It's also the search engines from these companies that will dictate which websites surface, and which don't. The algorithms from the platforms you use, like youtube for video, Facebook, or Twitter will define what content you see, and what content you don't.\n\nAnd then you have the lack of interoperability between services. But this stuff, you can still bypass yourself. More concerning is what countries do to limit what you can and can't access. \n\nhttps://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/internet-censorship-map/\n\nCountries implement various filters that are basically censorship. Some of it is acceptable, like blocking illegal material, and some of it is more questionable, like blocking websites that reference various copyrighted materials.\n\nAll these filters make the internet less open: you can't freely access what you're looking for if your country decides it's not allowed.\n\nWhen filters aren't enough, countries now implement full internet blackouts, generally to deal with protests against the government's actions. In 2020, 268 million people had their internet access shut down, that's 49% more than in 2019.\n\nWhile these blackouts are selective, and can still let governments access the internet themselves while the general public can't, they're devastating for a country's economy and business, and they can't be maintained for very long periods of time.\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/the-global-economic-damage-of-internet-blackouts/503093/\n\nhttps://news.yahoo.com/268-million-people-had-internet-122208785.html\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/iran-internet-blackout-economy/\n\nNow, the ultimate candidate against the open web is what China has built. They might be linked to the general internet everybody else enjoys, but it's a one way street: people can access their websites, but Chinese people can't access most of the rest of the internet, being limited to what the Chinese government allows.\n\nChina has built their own entire alternative internet, with their own services and their own websites, and it's not for nothing that we're talking about the great firewall of china, because when you're in there, you can't access anything the government has deemed \"not ok\".\n\nhttps://priteshpawar.com/chinese-alternatives-to-popular-apps-and-websites/tech-industry-and-case-studies/priteshpawar/\n that it would be a grave mistake to let their citizens have access to information sources that \n\nOf course, it's not all doom and gloom. The internet is showing signs of healing, at least on certain fronts.\n\nFirst, decentralized services are emerging again, slowly offering alternatives to the big closed down networks. Mastodon for example is a success story of a federated, decentralized network offering a viable alternative to Twitter, and that can talk to a variety of other services, like Pixelfed, Wordpress, Peerube, Castopod, and the like.\n\nVarious laws are also being passed, forcing big tech companies to relinquish a bit of control, over their platforms or app stores, for example, with Apple being forced in the EU to have iMessage be interoperable, and allowing 3rd party app stores on iOS.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjTzQJxw-20", "date_published": "2023-02-09 17:34:16+00:00",

I've been working on a code editor and I think that it's mature enough to catch some interest. It's using a custom GPU accelerated GUI written in C++. Currently implements some interesting features: LSP, terminal, auto-completion, linters, formatters, custom keybindings, plugins and more. It's a hobby project but still intends to be an alternative to other popular code editors like Sublime, Kate, Lapce, Lite XL (and takes inspiration from them).\nThe project was born as a playground for the GUI I'm developing (eepp GUI) and is advanced enough to currently be my main code editor, but it's a work in progress, and many features are still pending.\nSome minor hints on how to use it:\nFolders are used as project (and .gitignore is used to ignore files)\nThe wheel icon on the top-right has all the options you need (Ctrl/Cmd + M to show).\nSome keybidings to navigate any project (navigation is keyboard driven):\nCtrl/Cmd + K = Locate Files\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + F = Global Search\nCtrl/Cmd + Number (Go to tab #)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-peterson-college-psycology\" target=\"_blank\">Jordan Peterson</a> published 56 pages detailing the Ontario College of Psychologists' complaints against him, which led to their assertion that he needs to attend a social media reeducation camp. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cI promised I would post the allegations today. These pages are screenshots of original documents, so everyone interested can decide for themselves what is going on @JustnTrudeau included (take note: @PierrePoilievre).  https://t.co/7kekpXTQtt\\u201d</div> \u2014 Dr Jordan B Peterson (@Dr Jordan B Peterson)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/1611177250107396097\">1672865116</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first complaint claimed Peterson encouraged people to commit suicide on Twitter. </p><p>The tweet in question arose from a thread where Peterson said the world will peak at 9.5 billion people, and that it will still be a prosperous world. A scientist responded in disagreement, saying, \"Any arguments I have heard for supporting such a large human population completely overlook the huge loss of species and ecosystems resulting from our self-absorbed attention.\u201d</p><p>Jordan responded, \"You're free to leave at any point.\"</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cJordan Peterson uploaded a document with screenshots of the complaints made against him to the College of Psychologists.\\n\\nThe first allegation is that he, a licensed psychologist, made a joke about suicide directed at someone on Twitter.\\n\\nHere's what else it shows.\\n\\nStrap in.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Rachel Gilmore (@Rachel Gilmore)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atRachelGilmore/status/1611405636931141632\">1673024016</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another complaint said he \u201cpublicly opined that no Children\u2019s Aid Society intervention is required in a public review of the Ottawa <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/justin-trudeau-declares-truckers-terrorists\" target=\"_blank\">trucker protest</a>.\u201d It referenced when Peterson tweeted, \"children removed?\u2019 how, exactly? Why, exactly? By whom, exactly? Sent to where, exactly? And for how long, exactly? Think this through, Canadians. This is a bad decision.\u201d</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201c\"children removed\" how, exactly? Why, exactly? By whom, exactly?

Not beautiful. And no amount of authoritarian tolerance is going to change that.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Dr Jordan B Peterson (@Dr Jordan B Peterson)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/1526279181545390083\">1652728288</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The complaint claimed this was \"dangerous\" for a psychologist to say because of the prevalence of eating disorders in Canada. One could argue a few too many Krispy Kremes can also be \"dangerous.\"  </p><p>Many complaints centered on Peterson's criticism of transgenderism. One complainant said, \"he has failed to advocate for the autonomy and dignity of transgendered persons.\" <br /></p><p>Last June, Peterson's Twitter account was suspended after he tweeted, \"Remember when pride was a sin? And Ellen Page just had her breasts removed by a criminal physician.\" Where is the lie, though?</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cOkay, so now you can get banned for calling people by their name? @jordanbpeterson just got suspended from Twitter for writing that Ellen Page removed her breasts. Nothing wrong about it, even if Elliott Page is the preferred name now. \\n\\nPlease clean this place up, @elonmusk.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Ivar Arpi (@Ivar Arpi)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ivarpi/status/1542270194709561345\">1656540843</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There were numerous other complaints about COVID and Peterson's appearance on Joe Rogan. One complainant actually submitted the entire transcript of Peterson's 3-hour appearance on Joe Rogan. </p><p>In conclusion, the College of Ontario Psychologists essentially created a highlight reel of Jordan's Twitter. I honestly forgot just how cool he is until I read this document. </p><p>Peterson said he will ignore the paperwork that came with each complaint because it's too time-consuming. He submitted an application for judicial review to the Ontario Divisional Court.  He also said he will not complete the social media coaching mandated by the college, which would be at his own expense and cost up to $225 an hour. </p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

France's National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL) has <a href=\"https://www.cnil.fr/fr/identifiant-publicitaire-sanction-de-8-millions-deuros-lencontre-de-apple-distribution-international\">issued</a> an \u20ac8 million (roughly $8.5 million) penalty over allegations Apple automatically collected identifying data from App Store visitors using iOS 14.6 without their permission, helping the company target ads. The firm was profiting from violations of data protection law, according to officials.</p><p>You could turn off the ad targeting, but it was enabled by default and couldn't be disabled without wading through multiple menu levels, CNIL added. That reportedly made it impossible for users to give proper consent.

It seems people took me to be saying something like:\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\nOther people are foolish to be worried about privacy.  If there's\nanything you don't want public it's probably because you're doing\nsomething you shouldn't.  The decrease in privacy over time will be\ngreat for everyone once we adapt to it, and has no downsides.\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nTo be clear, this isn't (and wasn't) my view.  There are a lot\nof situations in which it makes sense for someone to take careful\nsteps to preserve various forms of privacy, there are things\npeople wouldn't want public for very good reasons, and decreasing\nprivacy has real harms.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nBut I also think it's very risky to rely on privacy. Many ordinary\nthings we do expose more than we probably expect.  What could someone\ninfer from the timing of your posts or messages? Background details in\npictures?  Cell tower logs of your movements?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOne of the major effects of increasing technology has been decreasing\nprivacy.  Cheap fast computers and storage make many things possible\nat massive scale that would have been infeasible before.  For example,\ncars have had license plates for a century but it wouldn't have been\npractical to use them to build up a detailed record of traffic at\nlarge. Banknotes have (always?) had serial numbers, but people\nreceiving bills didn't check them, record them, or use them to build\nup a record of how cash moves around our society.  People have\n(always!) had faces, but looking through the enormous number of\npublished photos to pick out ones with your face wasn't practical.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAnother way that technology offers the opportunity for reduced privacy\nis that more interactions happen via computer, where they can easily\nbe logged and categorized.  For example, when I visit a typical web\npage, many <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/why-i-work-on-ads\">trackers record this\nvisit</a>, and connect it to other pages I've visited.  Similarly,\nmost of my communication with others is now via text on computers,\nwhich is quite amenable to automated analysis.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI expect this trend to continue: computers are continuing to get\nsmaller, cheaper, and faster.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)\">Transformers</a>\nhave turned out to be incredibly capable. People building things that\ncollect and correlate this information are still adapting to the\ntechnology of several years ago, let alone what's still coming out.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOn the other hand, there are some trends in the other direction.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_law\">Privacy\nlegislation</a>, really taking off with Europe's 2016 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\">GDPR</a>\n(effective 2018), has made some forms of data collection and\nprocessing require the consent of the people it's about.  I haven't\nfound great polling on people's level of privacy concerns over time,\nbut the small amount I have found does <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/232319/facebook-users-privacy-concerns-2011.aspx\">show\nan increase</a>.  Technology options that make sacrifices for the sake\nof user privacy (<a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/\">DDG</a>, <a href=\"https://signal.org/en/\">Signal</a>, etc) are growing, though\nfrom a small base (and <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/\">Firefox</a> is\ndeclining, down to 3% from a peak of 32%).\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhere does this leave us?  Several thoughts:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>Despite the changes in sentiment and regulation around privacy,\nI don't think a private future is something we can count on. I think\nit's more likely than not that systems that can wring a great deal of\nmeaning out of everything everyone has done publicly are wildly\ndeployed during our lifetimes, probably within the next ten years.\nHacks, leaks, and blunders that expose information you trusted others\nto keep private are also going to be a continuing fact of life,\naccelerated by digitization.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Since we can't trust the future to keep things private, my\ngeneral approach to privacy is still to treat even nominally private\nthings as if they might become public, and act accordingly.\nHabitually making things public is one way to make this a lower\nburden, and is one which has some advantages (better feedback from\nothers, sharing information others can benefit from, etc).\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Efforts to promote a more private future, through technology or\nregulation, <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/effective-altruism-and-everyday-decisions\">individual\nchoice</a> or professional work, may or may not be worth it depending\non how you view the chances of success and the benefits if successful.\nI think this is very unlikely to beat work on things like 80k's <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\">most pressing\nproblems</a>, but I expect some people have high enough estimates on\nthe value of privacy work (ex: risk of <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/risks-of-stable-totalitarianism/\">stable\ntotalitarianism</a>, suppression of important but unpopular ideas)\nthat they'll disagree.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n  \n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02DpMpuBhcWADecdkXHBdz6E2if3R8WA8F9NXzoj4v4GWQxRS6AEenzuiQGSpmf8aCl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/GZ65zECCikbA29m8f\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109621520793839169\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/preparing-for-less-privacy", "date_published": "2023-01-02 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["privacy"]}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Third of world economy to hit recession in 2023, IMF head warns", "description": "<p>China\u2019s lagging growth a key threat this year, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said, while the US is \u2018most resilient.\u2019</p><p>For much of the global economy, 2023 is going to be a tough year as the main engines of global growth \u2013 the US, Europe and China \u2013 all experience weakening activity, the head of the International Monetary Fund has warned.</p><p>The new year is going to be \u201ctougher than the year we leave behind,\u201d IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said on the CBS Sunday morning news program <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/full-interview-imf-managing-director-kristalina-georgieva-on-face-the-nation-with-margaret-brennan/\">Face the Nation</a> on Sunday.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/02/third-of-world-economy-to-hit-recession-in-2023-imf-head-warns\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/02/third-of-world-economy-to-hit-recession-in-2023-imf-head-warns", "date_published": "2023-01-02 04:22:14+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["crisis"]}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Mortal Kombat 2 source code leak reveals unused animations and sprites", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2022/dec/27/mortal-kombat-2-source-leak/\">https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2022/dec/27/mortal-kombat-2-source-leak/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34214022\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34214022</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2022/dec/27/mortal-kombat-2-source-leak/", "date_published": "2023-01-02 03:43:58+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["games", "mortal kombat 2"]}, {"source": "https://levelup-edu.com", "title": "Bezos, Gates, Zuckerberg.
