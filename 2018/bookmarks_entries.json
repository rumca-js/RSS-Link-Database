Google's search neutrality has been compromised. Google notoriously develops more and more of its own tools that it then puts in front of organic search results.\n\nDuckDuckGo's business model is the greatest advantage over Google Search. DuckDuckGo doesn\u2019t have a filter bubble. Its search results are derived from over 400 sources, that include big search engines like Bing or Yahoo, but also DuckDuckGo\u2019s own web crawlers. Its organic results aren\u2019t intervened by personalized filters, because DuckDuckGo doesn\u2019t maintain a personal profile on you like Google does. \n\nSources:\nWeingerg vs Google\nhttps://www.cnet.com/news/google-owns-duck-com-but-itll-give-rival-duckduckgo-a-shoutout-anyhow/\nhttps://www.cnet.com/news/today-i-learned-duck-com-redirects-to-google-much-to-duckduckgos-annoyance/\nhttps://twitter.com/DuckDuckGo/status/1019565939317202944\nhttps://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/22/duckduckgo-google_n_2174286.html\nhttps://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/01/30/we-bet-you-dont-know-who-owns-duck-com-and-what-it-redirects-to/\n\nBias\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/evidence-that-google-search-results-are-biased-2014-10\nhttps://www.scribd.com/doc/233260174/techcrunch-confidential-yelp-user-behavior-study-on-google-results\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2014/07/09/yelp-google-anti-trust/\nhttp://www.benedelman.org/hardcoding/\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/16/google-autocomplete-rightwing-bias-algorithm-political-propaganda\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/technology/bias-google-trump.html\nhttps://techaeris.com/2016/06/10/google-manipulating-results-favor-hillary-clinton/\n\nPrivacy\n\nhttps://theintercept.com/2018/09/13/google-china-search-engine-employee-resigns/\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/technology/google-project-maven-pentagon.html\n\nGoogle reads your Gmail\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/15/gmail-scans-all-emails-new-google-terms-clarify\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-stop-reading-users-emails-to-target-ads-1498247136?mod=article_inline \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/technology/gmail-ads.html\nhttp://wcontest.com/2018/09/20/google-says-it-continues-to-allow-apps-to-scan-data-from-gmail-accounts/\n\nLocation tracking\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17684660/google-turn-off-location-history-data\nhttps://qz.com/1131515/google-collects-android-users-locations-even-when-location-services-are-disabled/\n\nIn retail\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2018/08/31/google-and-mastercard-reportedly-partner-to-track-offline-purchases/\nhttp://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2017/08/01/google_tracks_people_offline_to_see_if_online_ads_work.html\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/05/23/google-now-knows-when-you-are-at-a-cash-register-and-how-much-you-are-spending/?utm_term=.d26ce8fc4f40\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/TheHatedOne/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\nhttps://www.minds.com/The_HatedOne\n\nCredits:\nMusic by CO.AG Music https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcavSftXHgxLBWwLDm_bNvA/featured", "vote": 0, "artist": null}, {"manual_status_code": 0, "date_published": "2018-10-08T04:00:00+00:00", "album": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "comments": [], "source": "https://notrelated.xyz/rss", "language": "en-US", "page_rating": 0, "user": null, "source_obj__id": 204, "page_rating_votes": 0, "status_code": 0, "link": "https://notrelated.xyz/audio/s01/S01E05_-_The_Agricultural_Revolution_Has_Been_a_Disaster_for_the_Human_Race.mp3", "thumbnail": null, "page_rating_visits": 0, "tags": ["agriculture"], "bookmarked": true, "title": "The Agricultural Revolution Has Been A Disaster for the Human Race.", "age": 0, "permanent": false, "description": "<p>Whig History is one hell of a drug.
