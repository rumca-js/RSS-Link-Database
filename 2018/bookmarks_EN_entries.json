Too often do the \"Well, <em>actually!</em>\" crowd focus on listening to partial evidence instead of using their head, and we see how this has harmed the theories in the field of paleo-history. Soon, we'll move the microscope closer to home and talk about what early humans might've been up to all that time...</p><details>\ud83d\udcda See readings and other media.<p><em>Note that pay-walled academic articles may be obtained by feeding their URLs to sites like Sci-Hub.</em></p><ul><li>Smith et al. 2018. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25967\">Humans trived in South Africa through the Toba eruption about 74,000 years ago</a>.

What would that even mean? Does it mean we follow the laws of formal logic, or does it mean we only care about getting a positive end result? Some modern psychologists, often in the vein of <em>the Heuristics and Biases Program</em> (&agrave; la Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky) often implicitly assume that these are the same thing, that humans are often gravely miscalibrated in our sense of reason. We are logically broken. Some, proponents of <em>Libertarian Paternalism</em>, propose that this illogicalness should be actively mitigated by governmental policy and <em>Nudging</em> (see Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler's book <em>Nudge</em>).</p><p>But another line of thought, <em>Ecological Rationality</em> holds that what seems \"irrational\" about human behavior is only an artifact of when we fail to look at our decision-making in improper circumstances in the laboratory. What aspects of our psychology <em>seem</em> irrational are often mechanisms based in the wisdom of real-life risk, and far more trust-worthy than the recommendations of psychologists and behavioral economists. Sometimes even, our irrational mind is much smarter than we are.</p><details>\ud83d\udcda See readings and other media.<p><em>Note that pay-walled academic articles may be obtained by feeding their URLs to sites like Sci-Hub.</em></p><ul><li><em>Rationality for Mortals</em> (Gerd Gigerenzer)</li><li><em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> (Daniel Kahneman)</li><li><em>Nudge</em> (Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein)</li><li><em>What Darwin Got Wrong</em> (Jerry Fodor and Massimo Piatelli-Palmarini)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3132220\">\"Libertarian Paternalism\"</a> (Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein)</li><li><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00497.x\">Environments That Make Us Smart: Ecological Rationality</a> (Peter Todd and Gerd Gigerenzer)</li></ul></details><h1>Timecodes</h1><pre>00:00\tRationality for Big-Braned Mortals\n03:12\tThe Heuristics and Biases Program and System 1 and System 2 in Psychology\n07:12\tExperimentations in Human Irrationality and Cognitive Illusions, the Baseball Bat example\n10:05\tOn 250% Chances\n12:16\tPriming, framing and making money selling washing machines\n15:27\tBiases, risks and the Hard-Easy effect\n17:32\tA summary of Kahneman and Tversky's program\n18:55\tI know this model isn't real... implicatures and Linda the feminist bank-teller\n25:23\tDonations (https://donate.notrelated.xyz)\n27:58\ttfw when too rational to be rational???
