In H.E.R.'s case, you get two. She stunned us as a special guest for Daniel Ceasar's Tiny Desk concert earlier this year, in an appearance that showcased her vocal mastery. That earned her an invite to play again, front-and-center. She attacked her second go 'round with more fervor than the first, highlighting her skills as a multi-instrumentalist, maneuvering between acoustic and electric guitars, then the Fender Rhodes.\n\nWhile H.E.R. stands for \"Having Everything Revealed,\" she's an artist who's built her reputation on a certain degree of anonymity. The cover art for her debut, 2016 EP, H.E.R. Volume 1, shows a woman's silhouette over a blue backdrop. Her visuals never provide the audience a clear shot of her face and her signature accessory for every outfit is a pair of large, dark sunglasses.\n\nAs fans collectively squinted to get a better view, she delivered more projects. Another EP, H.E.R. Vol 2, came in 2017, followed months later by H.E.R. which combined songs from both volumes with a handful of new songs. The latter earned her five nominations for 2019's Grammy Awards, including Album Of The Year and Best New Artist Of The Year. She was born Gabriella Wilson to a Filipino mother and Black father. She first attracted the spotlight as a child prodigy, eventually signing a record contract when she was 14-years old. At 21, she's yet to release her debut LP.\n\nThere were two standout moments during her Tiny Desk set. One came at the midway point of her biggest hit so far, \"Focus.\" When the instruments dropped out and background vocalists Ajanee Hambrick and Malik Spence chimed in with their lush harmonies, the audience melted. The second came when her focus was interrupted by a charming and sincere expression of gratitude for the Tiny Desk platform. For a split second it appears as though she's about to remove those sunglasses. \"Not saying that I'm your favorite artist, but maybe me being here today says a lot.\"\n\nSet List\n\"Going\" (Interlude)\n\"Feel A Way\"\n\"Hard Place\"\n\"Focus\"\n\nCredits\nProducers: Bobby Carter, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Kaylee Domzalski, Maia Stern, Bronson Arcuri; Editor: Kaylee Domzalski; Production Assistant: Brie Martin; Photo: Cameron Pollack/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxxcEzM8r-4", "date_published": "2018-12-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCTsiZiMomJo6FOyiBaFeaIw", "title": "Why the Left Think They are Better | Peter Hitchens", "description": "Why the Left Think They are Better | Peter Hitchens", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qCHRYMe66g", "date_published": "2018-12-11 21:34:27+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-EN", "tags": ["propaganda", "ideology", "sjw", "the left wing"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Joey Alexander: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert", "description": "Nov. 30, 2018 | Lauren Onkey -- When a baby grand piano rolls into the office for a Tiny Desk concert, you expect something special. But none of us could have imagined what it's like to see 15-year old Joey Alexander play that piano with such mastery. The thing is, when you see him play live, you quickly forget his age and get lost in the intense focus of his performance. Alexander and his stellar supporting cast \u2014 Reuben Rogers on bass and Kendrick Scott on drums \u2014 form a tight trio, locking eyes as Alexander's compositions unfold. The relaxed, seasoned veterans looked thrilled to be playing with Alexander at the Tiny Desk, and he was clearly inspired playing with them. The crowd was both mesmerized and humbled by the memories of what they were doing at 15.\n\nBorn in Indonesia, Alexander learned to play by listening to his father's jazz albums. When he was just 10-years old, Wynton Marsalis invited him to play at a Jazz at Lincoln Center gala, and the young Alexander set the jazz world buzzing. He made his mark covering classics by Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane, but he's now recording and performing more of his own compositions. He showcased that original work during his Tiny Desk performance. Alexander's vigorously rhythmic playing was playful in the opening \"Eclipse\" (from his latest album of the same name), which he described as \"spontaneous playing.\" \"Bali,\" also from Eclipse, followed, while \"City Lights\" (from his 2016 album Countdown) closed a set that ranks among the year's finest jazz performances at the Tiny Desk.\n\nBuy 'Eclipse': http://joeyalexander.lnk.to/eclipseID\n \nHoliday EP 'A Joey Alexander Christmas': http://joeyalexander.lnk.to/jachristmasID\n\nSet List\n\"Eclipse\"\n\"Bali\"\n\"City Lights\"\n\nCredits\nProducers: Suraya Mohamed, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Kaylee Domzalski, Bronson Arcuri; Editor: Kaylee Domzalski; Production Assistant: Brie Martin; Photo: Cameron Pollack/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NIFz8wRvMs", "date_published": "2018-12-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://www.forbes.com", "title": "Harvard Scientists Begin Experiment To Block Out The Sun", "description": "Harvard Scientists Begin Experiment To Block Out The Sun", "link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2018/12/05/harvard-scientists-begin-experiment-to-block-out-the-sun/", "date_published": "2018-12-05 12:58:25+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["bill gates", "atmosphere", "climate change", "sun-dimming"]}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "title": "Are Google and Facebook really suppressing conservative politics?", "description": "Are Google and Facebook really suppressing conservative politics?", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/04/google-facebook-anti-conservative-bias-claims", "date_published": "2018-12-04 19:51:59+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en", "tags": ["facebook", "algorithms", "censorship", "search engines", "google"]}, {"source": "https://www.searchenginejournal.com", "title": "Google Shows Personalized Search Results When Logged Out, According to New Study", "description": "Google Shows Personalized Search Results When Logged Out, According to New Study", "link": "https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-shows-personalized-search-results-when-logged-out-according-to-new-study/281329/", "date_published": "2018-12-04 14:01:53+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["algorithms", "privacy", "big tech", "search engines"]}, {"source": "https://www.miamiherald.com", "title": "How a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the deal of a lifetime", "description": "How a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the deal of a lifetime", "link": "https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html", "date_published": "2018-11-28 20:01:48+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-EN", "tags": ["jeffrey epstein", "donald trump"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCspbA9TD8emEsqzN0LaQeYA", "title": "Eyes Wide Shut - What it all Meant", "description": "Eyes Wide Shut - What it all Meant", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXwy7M7Udmg", "date_published": "2018-11-17 20:36:02+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-EN", "tags": ["eyes wide shut", "movies"]}, {"source": "https://notrelated.xyz/rss", "title": "When You're Too Rational to Be Rational!", "description": "<p>Are humans rational? What would that even mean? Does it mean we follow the laws of formal logic, or does it mean we only care about getting a positive end result? Some modern psychologists, often in the vein of <em>the Heuristics and Biases Program</em> (&agrave; la Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky) often implicitly assume that these are the same thing, that humans are often gravely miscalibrated in our sense of reason. We are logically broken. Some, proponents of <em>Libertarian Paternalism</em>, propose that this illogicalness should be actively mitigated by governmental policy and <em>Nudging</em> (see Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler's book <em>Nudge</em>).</p><p>But another line of thought, <em>Ecological Rationality</em> holds that what seems \"irrational\" about human behavior is only an artifact of when we fail to look at our decision-making in improper circumstances in the laboratory. What aspects of our psychology <em>seem</em> irrational are often mechanisms based in the wisdom of real-life risk, and far more trust-worthy than the recommendations of psychologists and behavioral economists. Sometimes even, our irrational mind is much smarter than we are.</p><details>\ud83d\udcda See readings and other media.<p><em>Note that pay-walled academic articles may be obtained by feeding their URLs to sites like Sci-Hub.</em></p><ul><li><em>Rationality for Mortals</em> (Gerd Gigerenzer)</li><li><em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> (Daniel Kahneman)</li><li><em>Nudge</em> (Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein)</li><li><em>What Darwin Got Wrong</em> (Jerry Fodor and Massimo Piatelli-Palmarini)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3132220\">\"Libertarian Paternalism\"</a> (Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein)</li><li><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00497.x\">Environments That Make Us Smart: Ecological Rationality</a> (Peter Todd and Gerd Gigerenzer)</li></ul></details><h1>Timecodes</h1><pre>00:00\tRationality for Big-Braned Mortals\n03:12\tThe Heuristics and Biases Program and System 1 and System 2 in Psychology\n07:12\tExperimentations in Human Irrationality and Cognitive Illusions, the Baseball Bat example\n10:05\tOn 250% Chances\n12:16\tPriming, framing and making money selling washing machines\n15:27\tBiases, risks and the Hard-Easy effect\n17:32\tA summary of Kahneman and Tversky's program\n18:55\tI know this model isn't real... implicatures and Linda the feminist bank-teller\n25:23\tDonations (https://donate.notrelated.xyz)\n27:58\ttfw when too rational to be rational???

The duo usually performs their live shows over backing tracks with shimmering chrome guitars and keyboards mounted on mannequin lady legs. David Macklovitch (Dave 1) and Patrick Gemayel (P-Thugg) met when they were 15 while growing up in Montreal and have been cranking out the electro-funk jams ever since. On being Canadian, P-Thugg announced in his robot voice \"it's very, very cold\" to which Dave 1 quipped, \"it's cold... free healthcare.\" At first glance, their Jewish and Arab partnership might seem unlikely. But their signature sounds are undeniably infectious, epitomized by P-Thugg's Talk Box - an instrument that transforms his vocals into robotic sounds.\n\nWith a nod to DC's own funky go-go music scene of the '70s, their band was outfitted in go-go-style matching uniforms custom embroidered with the words \"Funk Lordz\". The breakdown at the end of the song \"Don't Sleep\" was a fitting tribute to NPR's hometown, Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Philadelphia based line-up included keyboardist Eugene \"Man-Man\" Roberts and legendary percussionists Rashid Williams and Aaron Draper who have played with the likes of John Legend, Jill Scott, The Roots, Adele, and Erykah Badu. Eric Watley filled out the low end with Dave 1 on electric guitar and P-Thugg on bass, rounding out the sextet.\n\nThe band played three tracks from their fifth album, Head Over Heels. They tossed in the backbeat-thumping \"Jealous (I Ain't With It)\" from 2014's White Women in a medley that opened the energized set. Listening to Chromeo is a joyous affair. Watching them get funky with a stellar band behind The Desk for the very first time, it's impossible to sit still.\n\nSet List\n\"Count Me Out/Jealous (I Ain't With It)\"\n\"Don't Sleep\"\n\"Must've Been\"\n\nMusicians\nDave 1 (Vocals/Guitar), P-Thugg (Bass/Talk Box), Eugene \"Man-Man\" Roberts (Keys), Rashid Williams (Drums), Eric \"E-Watt\" Whatley (Synth Bass), Aaron \"A-Drape\" Draper (Percussion)\n\nCredits\nProducers: Abby O'Neill, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern, Bronson Arcuri, Kaylee Domzalski; Production Assistant: Brie Martin; Photo: Cameron Pollack/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlAa0dc-E4w", "date_published": "2018-10-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "www.theguardian.com", "title": "'City of surveillance': privacy expert quits Toronto's smart-city project", "description": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/23/toronto-smart-city-surveillance-ann-cavoukian-resigns-privacy", "date_published": "2018-10-23 12:04:50+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en", "tags": ["smart city", "surveillance", "privacy"]}, {"source": "https://www.npr.org", "title": "Thousands Of Swedes Are Inserting Microchips Under Their Skin", "description": "Thousands Of Swedes Are Inserting Microchips Under Their Skin", "link": "https://www.npr.org/2018/10/22/658808705/thousands-of-swedes-are-inserting-microchips-under-their-skin", "date_published": "2018-10-22 19:59:32+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["microchips", "chip", "sweden"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Florence + the Machine: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert", "description": "Oct. 16, 2018 | Josh Rogosin -- Her nervousness was palpable and stood in stark contrast to her fully produced stage show. \"I'm sorry I'm shy,\" Florence Welch told the crowd of NPR family and friends gathered for her Tiny Desk performance. \"If this was a big gig, I'd probably be climbing all over here and running around.\"\n\nOpening with the song \"June,\" from Florence + the Machine's 2018 album High As Hope, Florence performed with her eyes closed. By the end of the three-song set, she fully embraced the experience and gave in to the rapturous audience. Within seconds of hearing her first note, the raw power of her un-amplified voice was chilling.\n\nIt's impossible to talk about Florence without her backing band. Tom Monger adds exquisite ethereal textures to the songs with his stunning mastery of the pedal harp. Hazel Mill's backing vocals and anthemic power chords on the keys accentuate the poignancy of the lyrics at just the right moments. And Robert Ackroyd's rhythmic, steady acoustic guitar drives the music forward.\n\nBut the intensity of the musicality is almost secondary to the message in her lyrics. Ear-worm melodies coupled with repetitive phrases create universal, awe-inspiring anthems. At the end of her first song, Florence implored the crowd to hold on to each other. In \"Patricia,\" she insisted it's such a wonderful thing to love. After 14 enchanting minutes, it's impossible to disagree.\n\nSet List\n\"June\"\n\"Patricia\"\n\"Ship to Wreck\"\n\nMusicians\nFlorence Welch (Vocals), Tom Monger (Pedal Harp), Hazel Mills (Keyboard and Vocals), Robert Ackroyd (Guitar)\n\nCredits\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Josh Rogosin, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, CJ Riculan, Maia Stern, Kaylee Domzalski; Production Assistant: Brie Martin; Photo: Heather Kim/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkPrXL-H5Qc", "date_published": "2018-10-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Caf\u00e9 Tacvba: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert", "description": "Oct. 12, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- It's appropriate that the pioneering Mexican band Caf\u00e9 Tacvba (Tacuba) start its set with \"Olita del Altamar\" (\"Waves from the High Seas\") from the group's 2012 album El Objeto Antes Llamado Disco. It's essentially an incantation of the magic that transpired during their performance behind Bob Boilen's desk. The lyrics sing of the comings and goings of waves, symbolic of the passage of time and fueled by the Mexican folk rhythm son jarocho, a favorite of the band's since their start almost 30 years ago.\n\nThey then fast forward to \"Diente de Le\u00f3n\" (\"Dandelion\"), from their 2017 album Jei Beibi. It's a majestic, stripped-down version that puts the emphasis back on the lyric, a plea for existential and environmental harmony using the metaphor of the weedy flower. \n\nAs usual, lead vocalist Rub\u00e9n Albarr\u00e1n is a captivating central presence, evoking a sense of down-home camaraderie with his ever friendly smile that has become the band's most outward image. Having seen the band play in front of dedicated fans in massive stadiums in Mexico City, it's striking to see his movements limited to a few careful spins and dance steps while still managing to embody the intense energy of their music.\n\nTheir song \"Las Flores,\" from their 1994 album Re, slips into the ska groove that attracted fans to rock en Espa\u00f1ol in general and to Los Tacvbas in particular, a beat that captures the adventurous musical energy that swept all of Latin America in the early 1990s.\n\nNot all bands would end their set with a power ballad, though very few bands hold their audience's attention and dedication like Caf\u00e9 Tacvba. But that's just how they close their set, the four principal members together for almost 30 years, casting a musical spell that still captivates after all this time.\n\nSet List\n\"Olita del Altamar\"\n\"Diente de Le\u00f3n\"\n\"Las Flores\"\n\"Que No\"\n\nCredits\nProducers: Felix Contreras, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Kara Frame, Kaylee Domzalski, CJ Riculan; Production Assistant: Brie Martin; Photo: Cameron Pollack/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O70s9aV_9_Q", "date_published": "2018-10-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCM1MpcmO5B2Kj-XS9S-XwRg", "title": "A Clockwork Orange - Film Analysis & Meaning [Full HD]", "description": "A Clockwork Orange - Film Analysis & Meaning [Full HD]", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOvP58ioBRc", "date_published": "2018-10-13 20:37:55+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-EN", "tags": ["clockwork orange", "movies"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCjr2bPAyPV7t35MvcgT3W8Q", "title": "Google vs DuckDuckGo | Search engine manipulation, censorship and why you should switch", "description": "Google vs DuckDuckGo | Search engine manipulation, censorship and why you should switch", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrsCEbi5N7Y", "date_published": "2018-10-13 13:51:29+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["search engines", "duckduckgo", "dead internet", "algorithms"]}, {"source": "https://notrelated.xyz/rss", "title": "The Agricultural Revolution Has Been A Disaster for the Human Race.", "description": "<p>Whig History is one hell of a drug.

If you look closely at the piano innards during \"Bardo,\" you can see a strip of black tape stretched over a few strings, opposite Illingworth's bobbing head. It mutes a group of strings, turning them into percussive jabs and dividing the instrument into more explicit rhythmic and melodic sections. What you can't see: GoGo Penguin's audio engineer a few feet to the left of frame, dialing-in reverb effects on the piano, which we heard in the room. These two elements, in tandem with bassist Nick Blacka's precise canvasing and drummer Rob Turner's charged and delicate pulse, have heavily contributed to the sonic identity of this trio - a signal to jazz jukebox listeners that, \"Ah yes, that's a GoGo Penguin tune.\"\n\nGoGo Penguin models closely the leaderless jazz power trio set in motion by forbearers in The Bad Plus, but you can also hear the drippings of electronica groups like Bonobo, and drum-and-bass foundations akin to Roni Size with a bit more acoustic rattle (Turner even fashions his own prepared drum accessories from rope, duct tape, and metal rings, which you can see resting atop his ride cymbal and snare. He tells me he usually has more, but he hasn't made new ones in a while).\n\nBut dissecting this music belabors what's certain: this trio has become a reference point of their own for new school instrumentalists, a coveted achievement for any jazz group, though their appeal stretches far outside the jazz ecosystem. In fact, in 2018 alone, the band played some of the world's most notable pop festivals like Bonnaroo and Outside Lands and top-tier international jazz festivals: Montreal and North Sea. This trio found a way to wedge themselves in the middle of the Venn diagram that overlaps musicians and music heads. Among my colleagues at NPR, I witnessed expressions ranging from studious squints to closed-eye meditation, those in the room experiencing GoGo Penguin's tunes like they would a collage: the fine details as valuable as the larger shape.\n\nSet List\n\"Raven\"\n\"Bardo\"\n\"Window\"\n\nCredits\nProducers: Colin Marshall Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Khun Minn Ohn, CJ Riculan; Production Assistant: Catherine Zhang; Photo: Samantha Clark", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47XlUL6sRow", "date_published": "2018-09-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://notrelated.xyz/rss", "title": "Democracy: Rule of the NPCs", "description": "<p>Does anyone even pretend to believe in democracy anymore?</p><p>As the veil of perfection of liberal democracy is now generally acknowledged to be in tatters, it's about time for normal people to start looking mechanically at what democracy really is.</p><p>In this episode, we explore the structure of a party system in democracy, Bryan Caplan (in <em>Myth of the Rational Voter</em>) argues that people are not randomly stupid, but <em>systematically</em> stupid, James Burham (in <em>The Machiavellians: The Defenders of Freedom</em>) tells us about Dante and the <em>real meaning</em> of political ideology, and SJWs absolutely annihilate Ben Shapiro and bulldoze his house down.</p><details>\ud83d\udcda See readings and other media.<p><em>Note that pay-walled academic articles may be obtained by feeding their URLs to sites like Sci-Hub.</em></p><ul><li><em>The Myth of the Rational Voter</em> (Bryan Caplan)</li><li><em>Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy</em> (Joseph Schumpeter)</li><li><em>What's Wrong with Democracy?</em> (Loren J.

They made a simple backyard video - a single camera shoot - that's now been seen almost 10 million times on YouTube. And the song they played, \"Peach Scone,\" has unlocked a door to a dream - to play a Tiny Desk Concert and be heard. The song is a tale of one-sided love - a tale of kindness in the face of loneliness and depression. Now, \"a couple of kids - five I guess\" as its lyrics go, get to bring their creative, urgent and somewhat nervous energy from Sacramento, Calif. to play \"Peach Scone\" and more to millions of other listeners.\n\nThis is a band always on the verge of emotional explosions, all while Frank Lopes, aka Hobo Johnson, is quoting Shakespeare and making references to Jay-Z, The Front Bottoms song \"Twin Size Mattress\" and so much more.\n\nThe directness in their music, with its chorus shouts (\"Damn I love those sandwiches!\") and the little asides (\"I got a duvet the other day - how do you wash a blanket? In a washer? That's what I found out\") make for a remarkably personal performance. At times it's as much a storytelling session or personal confession than a musical performance, and for me it conjures feelings of empathy and understanding and compassion.\n\nSet List\n\"Romeo & Juliet\"\n\"Sex in the City\"\n\"Peach Scone\"\n\"Creve Coeur 1\"\n\nCredits\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Bronson Arcuri, CJ Riculan; Editor: Production Assistant: Ema Sagner; Photo: John Poole", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8a2EosJIbM", "date_published": "2018-09-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCxcrzzhQDj5zKJbXfIscCtg", "title": "Are looks important to women?

Her lyrical prowess and storytelling were so moving, I immediately reached out to her on Instagram and asked if she would like to perform a Tiny Desk. \"Please don't make me cry right now. Tiny Desk!?!? You don't understand. I've been praying on this\", she replied. \"This (message) made my year and my band is ready!\"\n\nIll Camille strays a bit from the hip-hop zeitgeist. She raps about love and family serving as the source of her strength, the importance of self-worth as a woman, and the necessity to nurture oneself from within. That core keeps her secure even when confronted by the despair of poverty and the difficult grind of a young artist. And you can hear all that front and center in her music.\n\nHer voice is like a cool drink on a summer's day: smooth, clear and replenishing. Her refreshing self-awareness and raw honesty are inherent in each song, pairing nicely with the jazzy, melodic rhythms provided by her close knit crew of musicians. The first two songs, \"Spider's Jam\" and \"Live it Up,\" feature long time collaborators of Camille's, Iman Omari and drummer Greg Paul of Inglewood collective The Katalyst. Aneesa Strings, a bassist from the Bay Area, provided the low end foundation while also lending her rich vocals to \"Fight On.\" Also, guesting on this song is fellow L.A. native and emcee Damani Nkosi, who's been rocking with Camille since her debut album, The Pre-Write. The four-song set concluded with the upbeat \"Again,\" an ode to happiness and self-actualization.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Spider's Jam\"\n\"Live It Up\"\n\"Fight On\"\n\"Again\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nCamille Davis (vocals), Iman Omari (keys), Greg Paul (drums), Aneesa Strings (bass), Damani Nkosi (vocals)\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Abby O'Neill, Dani Lyman; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineers: Josh Rogosin, J.

She sang the break-up story with a smirk that belied the heartache hiding in her poignant lyrics. Then, after a short set break starring the Tiny Desk engineer Josh Rogosin, Juanes joined her to perform the duo's sultry single, \"Am\u00e1rrame\" (Tie Me Up).\n\nIt's rare to see Juanes in such an intimate setting. After almost two decades of performing solo, the Latin pop star is more of a stadium and arena kind of guy. It's a treat to hear his voice unencumbered by loud speakers or crowd noise, and to see his facial expressions as he sings lyrics that many of us know by heart. This marked a return to the intimacy that fueled his earliest days and that's still present in the personal lyrics that have sold millions of records.\n\nThat intimacy was heightened by the presence of Laferte. The duo performed a PG-13 version of \"Am\u00e1rrame,\" a passionate pop song with lyrics reminiscent of 50 Shades Of Grey. You can sense an obvious chemistry between the two during that song, as well as on the Juanes classic \"Fotografia\" (which originally featured Nelly Furtado).\n\nJuanes closed out the concert solo with a stripped-down version of \"Es Tarde\" from his last album, Mis Planes Son Amarte. The performance demonstrates why Juanes and Laferte's duet tour sold out across the U.S. this year. There is a magic here that makes for repeated viewing.

He performed a short set of classics, including \"Smooth Operator,\" \"Ain't No Half Steppin',\" \"Raw\" and a bonus freestyle. Through his warm, engaging and devilishly self-effacing style, the pioneer used an interlude between songs to address the intergenerational divisiveness defining rap today and the importance of fans of all ages supporting whatever they like, while \"focusing on what's positive and keeping that in the spotlight.\"\n\nKane, aka Dark Gable, was a breakout member of the seminal Juice Crew in hip-hop's golden era during the latter part of the 1980s. He popularized quick-cadence flows and multisyllabic rhyme schemes before passing the torch to early mentees like Jay-Z. Many a night during my adolescence was spent trying to memorize the baritone MC's lyrics. During those sessions, I could only feel sympathy for the subpar MCs who fell victim to the \"Wrath of Kane.\"\n\nThe smooth operator, Big Daddy Kane, still emits that same palpable swag he did as a lyrical heartthrob during his heyday. He strides into the room and fully commands it with his presence. And now that hip-hop is the most popular genre, with its biggest stars wielding global influence, it's important to us here at Tiny Desk to continue to make room for the legends who laid the foundation before the whole world became hip. Long live the Kane.\n\nSET LIST\n\u2022 \"Raw\"\n\n\u2022 \"Smooth Operator\"\n\n\u2022 \"Ain't No Half Steppin\"\n\n\u2022 \"Freestyle\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAntonio Hardy, Matt Lambert, Benjamin Geis, Judson Nelson, John Williams\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Abby O'Neill, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern, Alyse Young; Assistant Editor: Dani Lyman; Production Assistant: CJ Riculan; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8Uw1cl4xjg", "date_published": "2018-02-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://www.marketwatch.com", "title": "This is what happened when Norway mandated that women make up 40% of the boardroom - MarketWatch", "description": "This is what happened when Norway mandated that women make up 40% of the boardroom - MarketWatch", "link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-what-happened-when-norway-mandated-that-women-make-up-40-of-the-boardroom-2018-02-20-1088264", "date_published": "2018-02-20 20:58:03+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["feminism", "norway", "sexism"]}, {"source": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss", "title": "White House blasts Russia for NotPetya cyberattack", "description": "The White House lambasted Russia in a statement Thursday for \"the most destructive and costly cyber-attack in history\" and said it \"will be met with international consequences.\"", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/15/politics/white-house-russia-notpetya/index.html", "date_published": "2018-02-15 22:28:54+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["vulnerability", "virus", "notpetya"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Ibeyi: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert", "description": "Feb. 7, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- The twin sisters in Ibeyi started their turn behind the Tiny Desk by singing an invocation of a West African Yoruba deity.\n\nThey come by their connection to the Afro-Cuban culture by way of their late father, Miguel \"Anga\" Diaz, an in-demand Cuban percussionist who was part of a vanguard musicians who reinvigorated Cuban music before he died prematurely at age 45 in 2006. The sisters, Lisa-Kaind\u00e9 and Naomi D\u00edaz, carry that calling in their DNA, and how they've manifested it into their own art is nothing short of amazing.\n\nAs you see in this video, the twins (Ibeyi means 'twins\" in Yoruban) perform their music with the bat\u00e1 drums associated with Yoruban sacred music and their elaborate vocal arrangements channel the call-and-response of traditional African music. The melding of their voices when they harmonize can be breathtaking, but the same can be said about the messages behind their songs, themes that inspire both inward introspection and celebrations of life.\n\nThe sisters truly have a magic that transcends cultures and languages. I watched them lead a sold-out crowd at Washington D.C.'s 9:30 Club through a Yoruban chant, and it was mind-blowing. Imagine that magical intensity in the small confines of NPR Music's offices and you get an idea of how transfixed we were.\n\nAnd now you can experience that yourself.
