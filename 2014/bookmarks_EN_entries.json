It is an unprecedented fly-on-the-wall account of one of the most groundbreaking moments in recent history.\n\nIn January 2013, Poitras (recipient of the 2012 MacArthur Genius Fellowship and co-recipient of the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service) was several years into making a film about surveillance in the post-9/11 era when she started receiving encrypted e-mails from someone identifying himself as \"citizen four,\" who was ready to blow the whistle on the massive covert surveillance programs run by the NSA and other intelligence agencies.  In June 2013, she and Greenwald flew to Hong Kong for the first of many meetings with the man who turned out to be Snowden. She brought her camera with her. The film that resulted from this series of tense encounters is absolutely sui generis in the history of cinema: a 100% real-life thriller unfolding minute by minute before our eyes.  \n \nExecutive Produced by Steven Soderbergh.", "permanent": false, "artist": null, "bookmarked": true, "title": "Citizenfour Official Trailer 1 (2014) - Edward Snowden Documentary HD", "page_rating_votes": 0, "age": 0, "date_published": "2014-10-10T00:00:00+00:00", "language": "en-EN", "dead": false, "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 0}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/09/crypto-wars-redux-why-the-fbis-desire-to-unlock-your-private-life-must-be-resisted", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "album": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "comments": [], "thumbnail": null, "tags": ["privacy", "surveillance", "big brother", "encryption", "crypto wars"], "page_rating": 0, "vote": 0, "description": "Crypto wars redux: why the FBI's desire to unlock your private life must be resisted | Cory Doctorow | The Guardian", "permanent": false, "artist": null, "bookmarked": true, "title": "Crypto wars redux: why the FBI's desire to unlock your private life must be resisted | Cory Doctorow | The Guardian", "page_rating_votes": 0, "age": 0, "date_published": "2014-10-09T07:34:15+00:00", "language": "en", "dead": false, "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 0}, {"link": "https://www.techdirt.com/2014/10/06/washington-posts-braindead-editorial-phone-encryption-no-backdoors-how-about-magical-golden-key/", "source": "https://www.techdirt.com", "album": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "comments": [], "thumbnail": null, "tags": ["privacy", "encryption", "crypto wars", "surveillance"], "page_rating": 0, "vote": 0, "description": "Washington Post's Clueless Editorial On Phone Encryption: No Backdoors, But How About A Magical 'Golden Key'? | Techdirt", "permanent": false, "artist": null, "bookmarked": true, "title": "Washington Post's Clueless Editorial On Phone Encryption: No Backdoors, But How About A Magical 'Golden Key'? | Techdirt", "page_rating_votes": 0, "age": 0, "date_published": "2014-10-06T07:28:52+00:00", "language": "en-US", "dead": false, "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 0}, {"link": "https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/10/04/why-cant-apple-decrypt-your-iphone/", "source": "https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com", "album": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "comments": [], "thumbnail": null, "tags": ["privacy", "encryption", "apple", "iphone"], "page_rating": 0, "vote": 0, "description": "Why can\u2019t Apple decrypt your iPhone? \u2013 A Few Thoughts on Cryptographic Engineering", "permanent": false, "artist": null, "bookmarked": true, "title": "Why can\u2019t Apple decrypt your iPhone? \u2013 A Few Thoughts on Cryptographic Engineering", "page_rating_votes": 0, "age": 0, "date_published": "2014-10-04T07:28:52+00:00", "language": "en", "dead": false, "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_visits": 0}, {"link": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/10/internet-slowdown-protest-net-neutrality-fcc-regulators", "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "album": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "source_obj__id": 167, "comments": [], "thumbnail": null, "tags": ["net neutrality", "power", "politics", "big tech"], "page_rating": 0, "vote": 0, "description": "<p>Websites are loading slowly today to show what a future without net neutrality looks like.
