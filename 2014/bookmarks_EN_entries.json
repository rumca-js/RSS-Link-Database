It opens with audio of a spaceship about to take off. From that moment I have mixed feelings about the track. For one, the trend \u201c3-2-1-Blast-off!\u201d and its variants in even remotely spacey or astral sounding electronic tracks is just very overdone. The drums start out basic, though they work within context.

Bach: Prelude in C Minor \"pour le luth\" BWV 999;  David Tayler, archlute 4K UHD video", "description": "The prelude in C Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach, performed on the archlute by David Tayler.\nPlease subscribe to our channel https://www.youtube.com/VoicesofMusic/?sub_confirmation=1\nBach's prelude BWV 999 features a dialogue of two textures. The more present texture, which consists of an endless arpeggio in the treble range, is accompanied by a flat-footed bass line that is almost invariably composed of two melodic skips downwards. This bass pattern is varied only once, in the thirty-third bar  (Bach loved to construct pattern in threes), where the work stabilizes in G Major before the final coda. In the arpeggiated part, long lines of counterpoint are carefully woven into the chordal texture, also resolving in the thirty-third bar with the bass line. In the middle section of the work, the stepwise motion of the bass settles on a long pedal point on D which oscillates briefly with the E Flat a half step higher; the E Flat is the pivot point between the two keys of C Minor and G Major.\nTo use Richard Crocker's term, the arpeggios \"ruffle\" the homophony, and Bach uses his genius to create a small gem of a prelude from the different textures and harmonies.\nThe original manuscript for the prelude includes the rubric \"pour le luth\" (for the lute), and the work can be performed on different types of lutes or keyboards including the lute harpsichord, and sounds well on all of these. On the lute, the performer can use dynamics to accentuate some of the contrapuntal lines, but the work is equally persuasive on the keyboard.\nPitch A=415; temperament: Neidhardt-Doodle\nVisit us on the web at\nhttp://voicesofmusic.org/\nArchlute by Andreas von Holst\n#Bach #Prelude #LuteSuite", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnpaMm_2QYc", "date_published": "2014-10-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["music"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCn-K7GIs62ENvdQe6ZZk9-w", "title": "Hermione Mix", "description": "Remix of Hermione from Harry Potter.

Basically, it's a roughly 2'x2' plywood floorboard meant for pounding the beat. At a show just before this Tiny Desk Concert, craftily bearded singer Zac Little put his boot right through that floorboard.Saintseneca had its beginnings in the heart of a small Appalachian town in Ohio, and the band grew up at college in Columbus. This year's Dark Arc is a pastiche of gentle lyrical moments and punk anthems, often within the same tune and often with that aforementioned stomp, straight from a small wooden porch.After Saintseneca left the Tiny Desk, I pointed the band to a hardware store to replace its broken floorboard \u2014 only to get a note a while later telling me that the new board had been destroyed within weeks. Here's a good sampling of what the group does best, though you should be sure to see Saintseneca in concert, where its fierceness is afoot. --BOB BOILEN\n\nSet List:\n\"Happy Alone\"\n\"Fed Up With Hunger\"\n\"Blood Bath\"\n\nCredits:\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Denise DeBelius; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Olivia Merrion, Nick Michael; photo by Olivia Merrion/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8hnp9M4JCo", "date_published": "2014-07-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCfkp6AUuCwbVCyqQiefja9g", "title": "Amiga Lotus Turbo Challenge 2 Intro OST High Quality", "description": "Composed by Barry Leitch\n\nRecorded straight from game with Audacity on ASUS Xonar DGX sound card using WinUAE to emulate Amiga Paula OCS (MOS8364, 4 channels 8-bit PCM chip) sound.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vETonlaTZ4c", "date_published": "2014-06-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["chiptune", "music"]}, {"source": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss", "title": "U.S rules on cell phone privacy", "description": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday unanimously ruled that police may not search the cell phones of criminal suspects upon arrest without a warrant -- a sweeping endorsement for privacy rights.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/25/justice/supreme-court-cell-phones/index.html?eref=edition", "date_published": "2014-06-26 00:27:38+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["law", "freedom", "privacy"]}, {"source": "https://mashable.com", "title": "The 10 Biggest Revelations From Edward Snowden's Leaks | Mashable", "description": "The 10 Biggest Revelations From Edward Snowden's Leaks | Mashable", "link": "https://mashable.com/archive/edward-snowden-revelations#EX._mWvT8kq3", "date_published": "2014-06-05 14:55:15+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["surveillance", "big brother", "prism", "edward snowden"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCYbtgrJ7_ftpe9kwENAqxdg", "title": "Erik Satie - Gnossiennes 1,2,3 [HQ]", "description": "Gnossienne #1, #2, #3 pour piano\nPianist: Jo\u00e3o Paulo Santos", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTi9czvLa-4", "date_published": "2014-06-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["music"]}, {"source": "https://newrepublic.com", "title": "Facebook Could Decide an Election Without Anyone Ever Finding Out", "description": "Facebook Could Decide an Election Without Anyone Ever Finding Out", "link": "https://newrepublic.com/article/117878/information-fiduciary-solution-facebook-digital-gerrymandering", "date_published": "2014-06-02 11:14:27+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["corporatocracy", "election", "privacy", "facebook"]}, {"source": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz", "title": "John Minto: GCSB holding doors open while US buddies invade our privacy - NZ Herald", "description": "John Minto: GCSB holding doors open while US buddies invade our privacy - NZ Herald", "link": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/john-minto-gcsb-holding-doors-open-while-us-buddies-invade-our-privacy/JHCIWLWLUM5DSZRFKSYOAEX4CE/?c_id=1&objectid=11222413", "date_published": "2014-05-19 08:29:08+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["privacy", "edward snowden", "new zealand", "surveillance", "usa", "big brother"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCYVb99H41VIb3n8U1-cHhvw", "title": "University of Texas at Austin 2014 Commencement Address - Admiral William H.
