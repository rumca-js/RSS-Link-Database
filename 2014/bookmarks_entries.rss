My first vid on the problem with Facebook: http://bit.ly/1dXudqY
I know first-hand that Facebook's advertising model is deeply flawed. When I paid to promote my page I gained 80,000 followers in developing countries who didn't care about Veritasium (but I wasn't aware of this at the time). They drove my reach and engagement numbers down, basically rendering the page useless. I am not the only one who has experienced this. Rory Cellan-Jones had the same luck with Virtual Bagel: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18819338

The US Department of State spent $630,000 to acquire 2 million page likes and then realized only 2% were engaged. http://wapo.st/1glcyZo

Linus Torvalds: “I don't respect people unless I think they deserve the respect. There are people who think that respect is something that should be given, and I happen to be one of the people who is perfectly happy saying no respect should be earned. And without being earned, you don't get it. It's really that simple.”]]</description><pubDate>2014-09-04T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ017D_JOPY</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ017D_JOPY</guid>

Citizenfour Official Trailer 1 (2014) - Edward Snowden Documentary HD

CITIZENFOUR is the never before seen, utterly riveting first-person look at how director Laura Poitras and journalist Glenn Greenwald first met with whistleblower Edward Snowden in Hong Kong where he gave them documents showing widespread abuses of power by the National Security Administration.  It is an unprecedented fly-on-the-wall account of one of the most groundbreaking moments in recent history.

In January 2013, Poitras (recipient of the 2012 MacArthur Genius Fellowship and co-recipient of the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service) was several years into making a film about surveillance in the post-9/11 era when she started receiving encrypted e-mails from someone identifying ]]</description><pubDate>2014-10-10T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiGwAvd5mvM</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiGwAvd5mvM</guid>
