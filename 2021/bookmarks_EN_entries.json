Plato has also often been cited as one of the founders of Western religion and spirituality. The so-called neoplatonism of philosophers such as Plotinus and Porphyry greatly influenced Christianity through Church Fathers such as Augustine. Alfred North Whitehead once noted: \"the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.\" \nPlato was an innovator of the written dialogue and dialectic forms in philosophy. Plato is also considered the founder of Western political philosophy. His most famous contribution is the theory of Forms known by pure reason, in which Plato presents a solution to the problem of universals known as Platonism (also ambiguously called either Platonic realism or Platonic idealism). \nThis video highlights the best quotes and saying by Plato.

Driving around town, there\u2019s homeless encampments all over the place. They\u2019re on the side of the roads in dirt lots. There\u2019s long stretches of them on sidewalks. Some of em are tents, some are RVs, some are actual encampments with makeshift structures where hundreds of people gather in communities.\n \nIt\u2019s estimated there\u2019s around 5,000 homeless individuals throughout the city of Oakland, but no one really knows the exact number. And the number of people on the streets in Oakland has nearly doubled in the last two years alone. \n \nA lot of that has to do with the high cost of living in the Bay Area. Apartments that were once $1,000 a month now cost closer to $3,000 a month. A lot of the homeless are addicts. But there\u2019s no real one reason homelessness is so high in Oakland. You ask 10 homeless people why they live on the streets and you\u2019ll get 10 different answers. \n \nLook at this one in West Oakland. This one is sort of sanctioned by the city - meaning they don\u2019t run them off. Sometimes, it\u2019s easier to keep them in one place so they can monitor them and provide support. But this problem is impacting the community in a big way. \n \nLocal businesses complain about losing customers. I mean would you want to park near here to shop? Residents complain about homeless people stealing from them. Neighbors complain about loud noise and trash. Some say helping the homeless is backfiring.\n \nAnd the Oakland police are already stretched thin because of low numbers. There\u2019s many reasons for that - you know, vaccine mandates, early retirements and being defunded. \n \nI spent two days driving around Oakland, looking at how run down this once proud city has become. And along the way, I recorded all the homeless camps I saw.

Less profit for those companies means less money for retirement.\n\nThis might seem like common sense but it's becoming less common, thanks to a new investment strategy called ESG. ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. If you're wondering what that means, you're not alone.\n\nGenerally, it means that a company's first concern should no longer be how much money it makes, but rather how much social good it does. In other words, get woke, or get shamed.\n\nIf you're an oil company, for example, you're out of luck because, by the nature of your business, it's assumed you're destroying the planet. Never mind that you're powering homes and hospitals. That doesn't count.\n\nIn fact, if you're a company just trying to make a profit, you're the problem.\n\nESG proponent Klaus Schwab, chairman of the World Economic Forum, puts it this way: \"We can't continue with an economic system driven by selfish values, such as short-term profit...\"\n\nThe message is clear: we need ESG to save us from ourselves.\n\nReally?\n\nThe pursuit of profits has fueled many of mankind's greatest innovations and greatest companies.\n\nIt led Elon Musk to build electric cars, Andy Grove to design computer chips, and Reed Hastings to develop the world's most popular streaming service.\n\nEverything from aspirin to commercial airplanes, to yes, solar panels and wind turbines came about because of the desire for profit.\n\nProfit is why you have a job, clothes, a house, food, and every other necessity, not to mention luxuries.\n\nIt's the reason why you can live in Phoenix and stay cool, or live in Buffalo and stay warm.\n\nThe genius of capitalism is that it requires businesses to do good things for society to make a profit.\n\nThink about it:\n\nIf you want to start a business\u2014whether it's a dog hotel or a shoe factory\u2014you'll have to create a product or service that helps others\u2014at a price they can afford.\n\nIf you want to hire employees, you'll have to offer attractive wages and safe working conditions. Otherwise, nobody will work for you.\n\nIf you want customers, not only will you have to make a good product, but you'll need to cultivate a good reputation. That means treating those customers well and offering competitive prices.\n\nIn a free enterprise system, you can't make money without providing a social good. Capitalism is, by its very nature, conscientious.\n\nIt turns out, then, that profit isn't selfish\u2014it motivates us to contribute our talents to help others.\n\nESG threatens this system. By denigrating profit, it lessens the incentive and the means to do good. Without profits, companies won't have the capital to provide jobs, pay investors, or fund innovation.\n\nBut that's the world ESG wants you to live in: a world where profit takes second place to a preoccupation with income inequality, race and gender sensitivity, and climate alarmism.\n\nBut even if you wanted to address those concerns, how would ESG help you do it?\n\nThat's a fair question because there's no consensus on ESG standards.\n\nHere's a good example:\n\nThree self-proclaimed ESG watchdogs have given Tesla three completely different ratings: best, worst, and middling.\n\nIn capitalism, there is a simple metric to determine success: how much money you're making.\n\nUnder ESG, there is no such thing. It's a judgment call.\n\nTo make ESG investment strategies even more problematic, according to Meir Statman, professor of finance at Santa Clara University, \"in the long run, ESG investors are likely to earn lower after-fee returns than non-ESG investors.\" Over a period of say, 30 years, those fees alone could cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nSo, if ESG endangers profits, offers no clear metric for success, and is a mediocre investment, why is it even a \"thing?\"\n\nFor the complete script as well as FACTS & SOURCES, visit https://www.prageru.com/video/esg-woke-to-broke", "age": 0, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-tJNuHqHW8", "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "rumpel", "title": "ESG: Woke to Broke", "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "language": "en-US", "dead": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCZWlSUNDvCCS1hBiXV0zKcA", "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2021-10-18T00:00:00+00:00", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O-tJNuHqHW8/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"tags": ["programming", "javascript"], "bookmarked": true, "description": "Developer / Tinkerer / Absurdist", "age": 0, "link": "https://nadh.in/blog/javascript-ecosystem-software-development-are-a-hot-mess/", "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "Thomas Pain", "title": "The Javascript \"ecosystem\" is a hot mess and so is software development in general - nadh.in", "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "language": "en", "dead": false, "source": "https://nadh.in", "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2021-10-17T10:31:15+00:00", "thumbnail": null}, {"tags": [], "bookmarked": true, "description": "Canon USA is being sued for not allowing owners of certain printers to use the scanner or faxing functions if they run out of ink.", "age": 0, "link": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/legal/canon-sued-for-disabling-scanner-when-printers-run-out-of-ink/", "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "Thomas Pain", "title": "Canon sued for disabling scanner when printers run out of ink", "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "language": "en-us", "dead": false, "source": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com", "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2021-10-17T07:59:04.789371+00:00", "thumbnail": null}, {"tags": ["privacy", "facebook"], "bookmarked": true, "description": "Again, Elon Musk is against social media.

Leaders from 44 countries met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to decide how the new global economy would run and what it\u2019s financial bedrock would be. The Conference settled on the US Dollar as the de facto global currency. This meant that the paper money printed by one nation was used everywhere.\n\nAfter JFK, the US chose a radically different economic path filled with expensive spending. The one nation the world trusted to uphold the entire financial system was drowning in debt. \n\nNixon changed the very foundation of the global financial system in a total of 16 seconds. By giving the middle finger to countries wanting their gold back, as a \u201ctemporary\u201d measure. \n\nFor the first time in modern history, the world moved from the gold standard, to a global reserve currency not backed by anything at all, just the blind faith that the US dollar was worth something - fiat money. \n\nOPEC, the cartel of Arabic petroleum exporters, announced an embargo on oil sales to the US and the quadrupling of global oil prices.\n\nWhy was this so devastating? Because oil dominated every aspect of Americans\u2019 daily lives. When OPEC exposed this giant weakness in America by restricting their oil supply, the US had to make sure something like this would never happen again.

You might actually be able to find recordings of me\ncursing four or five years ago, but as of now, I really stand by my\ndecision.</p>\n<p>Obscenities are the linguistic equivalent of an trashy emaciated person\nentirely decked in tattoos, smoking cigarettes and wearing a shirt with\nnudity on it. They'll defend what they do on the idea that it's\nsomeone &quot;their right,&quot; or &quot;expression,&quot; as if they do what they do\nfor some lofty philosophical reason. What everyone else sees is a person\nwho is not in control of themselves or their vices, in fact, someone who\nviews their vices as a good thing.</p>\n<p>There's the atomistic and nihilistic tendency to give an\n&quot;intellectual&quot; argument for obscenities: &quot;What's so special,&quot; the\nargument goes, &quot;about obscenities in English? They're just a\ncombination of arbitrary sounds! They don't have some objective magical\nharm in them.&quot;</p>\n<p>But the &quot;arbitrary sounds&quot; in an obscenity do indeed have a special\nplace in human psychology. Obscenities are produced and processed in the\nbrain quite differently from non-obscene language, involving the more\nanimalistic/reptilian parts of the brain. When assembling a well-thought\nout case, there is really never a temptation to litter it with curses.</p>\n<p><strong>When a person curses, it's a direct indication that they are thinking\non a lower, more reactive, more emotional level.</strong></p>\n<p>I get a lot of email every day and most I don't answer for time\nconstraints. I've gotten good at filtering out emails, and I have\nrealized that obscenities are one of the best indications of a low\nquality content. I haven't gone so far as to totally block curse words\nwith Spam Assassin, but it is genuinely rare that I receive an email of\nany quality with obscenities.</p>\n<p>All of this is to say that obscenities are a great indication of\nreactive thinking. When someone is cursing, he is thinking at least in\npart like an animal. In deciding not to curse, I have decided to be\nquiet first, then only evaluate things calmly afterwards.</p>\n<p>For me, there is extra reason not to curse because I am in a position of\nan exemplar for many people on the internet. The internet is full of\n&quot;snarky&quot; people cursing profusely and creating the idea that all\n&quot;famous&quot; people should be highly arrogant and emotional.</p>\n<p>There might be times when it's proper for someone to react in righteous\nanger, but those are in reality so rare as to only happen in\nlife-and-death situations.

And I\nwill <em>still</em> not give you analytics because I don't let my file\nmanager, email client, music player, video player, text editor or any\nother random program monitor me for no reason, least of all will I allow\na browser, which often handles the most sensitive information.</p>\n<p>It's a statement of just how bad the browser market is that this is\neven something we're talking about.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ad-blocking-must-come-with-the-browser\">Ad-blocking must come with the browser.</h3>\n<p>No one opens up a browser to view ads.

HTTPS everywhere is a sensible universal browser\nfeature as well. There are no places where using HTTP is preferrable to\nusing HTTPS if available. If there are reasons to ever use HTTP only or\nto view ads, they are so rare as to hide them away in the Settings Menu.</p>\n<p>Brave (Le Shill Lion) has at least done us the favor of blocking ads by\ndefault (it also has HTTPS everywhere). Qutebrowser has a notional hosts\nad-blocker that allegedly blocks I guess some things, but you will still\nget an add-full browsing experience.

Lol.</p>\n<p>I complimented Brave for adding ad-blockers to their browser by default.\nThe issue is that they also continually add more and more and more stuff\nto their browser of extremely niche orientation in every single update.</p>\n<p>Update Brave and there'll be some new Crypto gadget on the main screen\nwhich is probably making some kind of unsolicited connections to\nsomething or another. Brave has been dutiful enough to allow everything\nto be disabled, but none of this is browsing related. I want a browser.\nStop giving me stuff that's not a browser. That's why I liked the idea\nof the ad-block, but it looks like Brave will need a feature-block as\nwell.</p>\n<p>Aside from Brave, about <em>every browser</em> from Pale Meme to unJewgled\nChromium has a distracting stupid start page that advertises your\nhistory or suggests inane sites. When I open a fresh browser window,\nunless I have specifically created an HTML page which I have set as my\nhomepage, I want to see a clean virgin page. I don't want to see giant\nsoy blocks that show a links to my bank account or the Bitchute\ndocumentaries I was just watching. If I want to get there quick, I'll\nbookmark it, thank you.</p>\n<p>I want a browser to be <strong>neutral</strong>, not personalized. Or at least\n<strong>neutral by default</strong>. I don't want it to advertise new features and\nsoftware. I don't want it to change when I visit a site.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-not-clutter-home\">Do not clutter home!</h3>\n<p>Browsers routinely make messes in home directories. XDG Compliance. Know\nthese directories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>~/.config/</code> &ndash; for configuration files</li>\n<li><code>~/.cache/</code> &ndash; for your cache</li>\n<li><code>~/.local/share</code> &ndash; for share files</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is where stuff goes so 100 useless folders don't clog up your home\nwhen you <code>ls -a</code>. No one seems to have told this to browser developers.</p>\n<p>Chromium browsers give you this useless <code>~/.pki/</code> directory. If you're\nusing a Furryfox clone, they are going to force at least <code>~/.mozilla/</code>\non you, but you'll also get something else. Installed Librewolf?\nYou'll get <code>~/.librewolf/</code> too.</p>\n<p>I don't know how hardcoded Google and Mozilla made this annoyance, but\nif you can deGoogle Chrome, you can use the proper XDG directories.</p>\n<p>Dishonorable mention <em>definitely</em> goes to Pale Moon. Being an\nindependent browser, you would <em>think</em> they would jump at being less\nannoying. Nope: <code>~/.Moonchild Productions</code> right in your home directory.\nCapital letters and whitespace: a big eff-yew to Unix-based operating\nsystems. (I think they made this lower-case now?)</p>\n<h3 id=\"must-be-written-in-a-sensible-language\">Must be written in a sensible language.</h3>\n<p>Aw, Dang!</p>\n<p>Sorry, Qutebrowser, you thought you could make it all the way right?</p>\n<p>Hey, that's okay, there are a lot of great aspects to being written in\nPython: it's easier for people to play around with your config file and\nscript things into it, but let's be real: you're slow and buggy and\ntake way more system resources than a browser written in C or C++.\nThat's just not going to cut it for a mainstream browser that old\nboomers are going to be watching YouTube and Netflix in with 250 other\nopen tabs.</p>\n<p>Maybe if you were written in Go? Or maybe you could get compiled in\nCython or something? Idk, but as it is, it ain't cutting it.</p>\n<p>Of course I realize that Qutebrowser does basically everything else\nwell. If I had a computer with more CPU power and RAM, I might use\nQutebrowser. It has gotten a lot better over the years.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"features-a-good-browser-must-have\">Features a <strong>Good</strong> Browser must have.</h2>\n<p>Now that we've ascended past the summits of the bare minimum, we might\nas well discuss what additional features every browser should have.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-config-file\">A config file.</h3>\n<p>I don't care if only 2% of people know what a configuration file is,\nyou need one. You can keep your Settings menu for normies, but it's\nnuts that browsers think it's okay to get by without a configuration\nfile.</p>\n<p>Once someone has their browser configured, all they have to do if they\nchange computers or want to replicate their settings is to move one\nfile. Or for someone like me, who has <a href=\"https://larbs.xyz\">people wanting to install my\nsystem configuration a lot</a>, it would be convenient\nto be able to have a single text message that assembles a browser with\nsensible settings. You just can do that though. You can sorta-kinda do\nthat with some Furryfox settings, but for a Chromium browser, forget\nabout it.</p>\n<p>Either way, there needs to be a simple text file that can handle setting\nsettings, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add-on lists including links to the source (similar to a vim plugin\nmanager)</li>\n<li>Key bindings and custom shortcuts</li>\n<li>Bookmarks</li>\n<li>Search engine prefixes (combination of the two above).</li>\n<li>Graphical settings, color appearance, organization of tabs and\nbuttons</li>\n<li>Font, language</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Config files, even if 2% of people are going to use them now open up a\nnew world of sharable and editable settings. This will solve a lot of\ntech support issues as well, frankly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"actually\">Actually...</h3>\n<p>After the configuration file, every other feature a browser should have\ncomes for free. For example, it would be nice to get vim-like\nkey-bindings for mouseless browsing, but that is really dealt with\ncustom key-binds (and I suppose a link hint feature).</p>\n<p>In general, I feel that once you have the sensible defaults above and\nconfiguration file, you really have everything. Browsers suddenly become\nprograms with the same level of usability and customizability and\nnon-egregiousness of every other program on the computer.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>A browser...</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Must actually work.</li>\n<li>Must be free and open source software.</li>\n<li>Must make no unsollicited connections.</li>\n<li>Must block unsollicited ads and other sensible defaults.</li>\n<li>Must have sensible options for history and cookies.</li>\n<li>Must not be cluttered by features irrelevant to browsing.</li>\n<li>Must not clutter the filesystem.</li>\n<li>Must be written in a fast language light on system resources.</li>\n<li>Must have a configuration file.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Tell me when a browser finally meets these requirements.</p>", "age": 0, "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/every-web-browser-absolutely-sucks/", "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "title": "Every Web Browser Absolutely Sucks.", "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "language": "en-US", "dead": false, "source": "https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml", "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2021-08-28T00:00:00+00:00", "thumbnail": null}, {"tags": [], "bookmarked": true, "description": "sync.Once is pretty underrated", "age": 0, "link": "https://blog.chuie.io/posts/synconce/", "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "Thomas Pain", "title": "The underutilized usefulness of sync.Once | ramblings of 1lann", "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "language": "en-US", "dead": false, "source": "https://blog.chuie.io", "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2021-08-27T21:43:53+00:00", "thumbnail": null}, {"tags": [], "bookmarked": true, "description": "A hacker has claimed partial responsibility for T-Mobile data breach and he describes their security as ", "age": 0, "link": "https://www.vpnranks.com/blog/hacker-claims-responsibility-for-t-mobile-attack-says-their-security-is-awful/", "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "Thomas Pain", "title": "Hacker Claims Responsibility for T-Mobile Attack - Says: \"Their Security is Awful\"", "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "language": "en", "dead": false, "source": "https://www.vpnranks.com", "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2021-08-27T17:35:51.438438+00:00", "thumbnail": null}, {"tags": [], "bookmarked": true, "description": "Frank\u2019s views were disturbing, a brazen assertion of white privilege.

(Basically, they were bailing out corporations that had too much debt or needed to borrow money)\nYou guessed it, they went right back to BlackRock.\nEven though again, the same corporations BlackRock was helping to bailing out, were the same corporations they owned some of the biggest stakes in\n\nAnd yet, despite all his considerable power, the general public has practically never heard of Larry Fink\nWith BlackRock barely coming into the public eye during the recent claims that they\u2019re buying up single-family homes\nThat\u2019s because Larry is smart - he\u2019s intentionally kept it that way\nHe\u2019s spent the last 33 years building BlackRock into the biggest asset manager in the world, with over $9 trillion dollars under their management\nToday, BlackRock\u2019s clients include the retirement accounts of average everyday people in the form of pension funds, they also have sovereign wealth funds as their clients, other central banks, college endowments, \u201cFortune 500 companies\u201d, and millions of individual investors\n\nThis is BlackRock\nWhat some call \"the most influential financial institution in the world,\"\nThe world's largest shadow bank,\nAnd perhaps\u2026 the company that owns the world\u2026 \nWhen Larry Fink was asked by Bloomberg if it\u2019s true that he\u2019s the most powerful man in finance - the man responsible for $9 trillion dollars tried to convince you otherwise - that \u201cI don\u2019t think of myself as powerful\u201d\nIs that true? Does BlackRock own the world? Well, it\u2019s a little complicated\n-----------------------\nJuan Rios - Caba\u00f1a https://chll.to/3c57d08c\nMisha, Jussi Halme - Lullaby https://chll.to/7a8c0040\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.

The city\u2019s violent crime rate is higher than the national average and other similarly sized metropolitan areas.1 Also alarming is Philadelphia\u2019s drug overdose rate. The number of drug overdose deaths in the city increased by 50% from 2013 to 2015, with more than twice as many deaths from drug overdoses as deaths from homicides in 2015.2 A big part of Philadelphia\u2019s problems stem from the crime rate and drug abuse in Kensington. \n\nBecause of the high number of drugs in Kensington, the neighborhood has a drug crime rate of 3.57, the third-highest rate by neighborhood in Philadelphia.3 Like a lot of the country, a big part of this issue is a result of the opioid epidemic. Opioid abuse has skyrocketed over the last two decades in the United States and Philadelphia is no exception.  Along with having a high rate of drug overdose deaths, 80% percent of Philadelphia\u2019s overdose deaths involved opioids2 and Kensington is a big contributor to this number. This Philly neighborhood is purportedly the largest open-air narcotics market for heroin on the East Coast with many neighboring residents flocking to the area for heroin and other opioids.4 With such a high number of drugs in Kensington, many state and local officials have zoned in on this area to try and tackle Philadelphia\u2019s problem.", "age": 0, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB6gwOBClwE", "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "rumpel", "title": "Streets of Philadelphia, Kensington Avenue, What\u2019s going on Monday, July 26 2021.", "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "language": "en-US", "dead": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCOuf_kStlWnhuauw4ce8l-w", "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2021-07-29T00:00:00+00:00", "thumbnail": null}, {"tags": [], "bookmarked": true, "description": "More than ten million of us have downloaded it, despite the government saying vaccine passports aren\u2019t a thing.

In the modern view of freedom, freedom\nmeans the ability to do what you want without the government or society\ntelling you what to do, so (1), the drug addict, should be more\n&quot;free.&quot;</p>\n<p>But at the same time, this feels wrong. (2) probably lives a better\nlife. He is more suited to make more and better decisions. Someone\naddicted to drugs is highly constrained in the kind of life they have to\nlive to fulfill their addiction.</p>\n<p>Even extreme libertarians will probably say (2) is in a better place,\nbut might chalk things up to (1) needing to have more discipline and\nthey'll make up some just-so story as for why unambiguously bad drugs,\nor pornography, or dangerous things should be allowed anyway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"classical-freedom\">Classical freedom</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"resright\"><img src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/paul.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n<p>In reality, since the Enlightenment, we have had a hobbled understanding\nof what &quot;freedom&quot; is. Enlightenment &quot;freedom&quot; is only the freedom to\nperfectly follow the whims of impulses and vices indiscriminately.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-christian-tradition\">The Christian tradition</h3>\n<p>Christians stated the classical view of freedom very clearly. Paul\nwrites that all men are either &quot;slaves to Christ&quot; or &quot;slaves to\nsin.&quot; The modern man wants to retort that he doesn't want to be a\nslave to anything, but wants to be his own master, but there is really\nno such thing.</p>\n<p>One can be guided by Christ, or more generally, by consistent moral\nprinciples, restraint and forethought. Or one can abandon the pretense\nof morality and by definition follow his impulses to fornication,\nsubstance-abuse, and general reckless living.</p>\n<p>These masters aren't equivalent either. Being a slave to one is nothing\nlike being a slave to another. Slaves to sin are wrapped up into\nincoherent and uncontrollable behavior. Following one's sexual whims\nmight be inconsistent and thoughtless behavior that one likes one second\nand is disgusted by the next. It might mean someone exploding in rage\nand emotion.</p>\n<p>This &quot;free&quot; man, a slave to sin, is only bound by the practical\nconsideration that he might get caught or shamed by &quot;prudes&quot; and that\nmight dampen his ability to follow his inpulses more.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impulses-are-not-the-man\">Impulses are not the man</h3>\n\n<figure class=\"titleimg\"><img src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/nihilism.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n<p>If we look at the modern world as if it has desires and goals for us, it\ncertainly seems like it is trying to induce as many people as possible\ninto being slave to sin. People no long have identity in who they\nactually are, but in accidental preferences formed over years of\nimpulse-seeking: their sexual fetishes, drugs of choice, their favorite\nTV show to consoom or their favorite music they constantly pump in their\nhead to dampen the possibility that an original reflective thought might\noccur to them.</p>\n<p>More than that, these people often can't even fathom of life without\ntheir master sins, and retort in rage when someone dares to direct them\notherwise or &quot;judge&quot; them. They don't just have a kind of Stockholm\nSyndrome with sin, but they can't comprehend the fact the people are\nsomething deeper than their pleasure habits.</p>\n<h3 id=\"control-of-impulses-leads-to-freedom\">Control of Impulses Leads to Freedom</h3>\n<p>However if one can constrain his impulses, he will be free to truly sit\ndown and deliberate and make free decisions on what is best to do.</p>\n<p>This is where true freedom begins. The concept is totally alien to the\ncoomer, the slave to sin, because he can't even afford the mental space\nto think further than his constant service to sin.</p>\n<p>To him, it is merely &quot;me having fun,&quot; versus &quot;some haters who are\nagainst fun.&quot;</p>\n<h2 id=\"slaves-to-vices-are-slaves-in-general\">Slaves to Vices are Slaves in General</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"titleimg\"><img src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/fedora_consoomer.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n<p>If you indentify with your impulses, it's very easy to get you\nmotivated to defend them with the same impulsivity if you are told that\nthey are &quot;under attack.&quot; While impulsive people might be hard to be\naround as individuals, they are easy to control as groups and can be\nherded around like unthinking sheep.</p>\n<p>People who are reactive in politics are always the losers, and what is\nan impulsive life but one that is entirely reactive and therefore\ncontrollable?</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-kingly-state\">The Kingly State</h2>\n<p>With the classical understanding of freedom, the goal of social\nconventions, traditional morality and the good government is to increase\ntrue liberty by minimizing one's temptation to vice. People are born\nwith some tendency to vice (original sin to Chrisitians) that can be\neasily made worse. The goal of normal society is to lead people away\nfrom lasciviousness and impulsive behavior. (That is clearly not the\ngoal of the modern West, however.)</p>\n<p>A drug addict is not free. A teenager who gets home from school\neveryday, closes his door and watches internet pornography is not free.\nA person who compulsively checks their social media feed when they wake\nup or are minorly bored is not free. A woman who sleeps around\nthroughout her twenties and is left with nothing is not free. A boy who\nstays up late because he has to &quot;grind&quot; on a video game is not free.</p>\n<p>No one can say that these people truly want what they do: no one <em>fully</em>\nconsents to any impulsive behavior. This is actually why in the Catholic\ntradition, sins of incontinence are not as grave as deliberate sins.\nIt's not a fair game.</p>\n<p>Either way, the goal of the church, or a moral society and moral\ngovernment generally, is to increase freedom by being a countervailing\npower to inborn vices.</p>\n<p>The point of moral instruction is not to restrain man, but to make him\nmore free by eliminating the true causes of his enslavement: his vices,\nhis bad habits, his sexual paraphilias, his gluttony and greed.</p>", "age": 0, "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/modern-freedom-means-being-a-slave-to-impulses/", "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "title": "Modern \"Freedom\" Means Being a Slave to Impulses", "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "language": "en-US", "dead": false, "source": "https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml", "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2021-05-06T00:00:00+00:00", "thumbnail": null}, {"tags": ["censorship", "facebook", "january 6"], "bookmarked": true, "description": "", "age": 0, "link": "https://www.grunge.com/401335/what-a-facebook-ban-really-means-for-trump/", "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "title": "What A Facebook Ban Really Means For Trump", "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "language": "en-US", "dead": false, "source": "www.grunge.com", "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2021-05-05T12:04:50+00:00", "thumbnail": null}, {"source_obj__id": 18, "tags": ["conspiracy theory"], "bookmarked": true, "description": "<h2 id=\"how-to-do-magic-tricks\">How to do magic tricks...</h2>\n<p>Magicians have this concept called &quot;Multiple Outs.&quot; It's actually how\nyou can do simple magic tricks. Suppose you have a person pick a card\nand say you will guess the suit of their card.</p>\n<p>They pick a diamond card and announce it, and you tell them to check\nunderneath their chair to reveal a slip of paper that says, &quot;You will\npick a diamond card.&quot;</p>\n<p>That might sound like a nice trick, but if they had picked a spade, you\nhave another piece of paper under the fruitbowl that says, &quot;You will\npick a spade.&quot; If they pick a club, you unbutton your shirt to reveal a\ngiant club written on your undershirt, etc.</p>\n<p>In essence, for any possible outcomes, you have a response planned that\nseems natural and predictive. This is one of the ways that magicians do\nwhat they do, often with more complicated mechanisms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"applications\">Applications</h2>\n<p>Multiple outs are actually real magic.</p>\n<p>You've heard the expression &quot;hope for the best and plan for the\nworst,&quot; but the concept of multiple outs is that one should be planning\nfor <em>all possible</em> outcomes, including those that you yourself might not\neven anticipate now.</p>\n<p>Every business plan should have multiple outs. Your major life decisions\nshould be planned with multiple outs. You should even tacitly plan dates\nwith multiple outs, so that unexpected events can be met with a\nconfident, perhaps even better replacements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"multiple-outs-in-political-power\">Multiple outs in political power</h2>\n<p>Any longstanding group in political power is by the mere fact of their\nsurvival sure to have mastered the sleight of hand of &quot;multiple outs.&quot;</p>\n<p>This serves not only to continue in political power, but to cement their\npower further by the appearance of inevitability. A ruler or ruling\nclass puts themselves in a position to benefit from any possible\noccurrence: be ready even to use disaster to your benefit, as Obama's\nchief of staff Rahm Emmanuel put it succinctly: &quot;You never let a\nserious crisis go to waste.&quot;</p>\n<h3 id=\"conspiracy\">Conspiracy?</h3>\n<p>People skeptical of the state sometimes devolve into thinking that every\nmajor political event is in one way or another is planned in advance.\nThis is because they don't understand and apply the concept of multiple\nouts. They see that their rulers are good at benefiting from any chaos\nor unforeseen events, so assume these events must've been engineered.</p>\n<p>Look at the corona virus: it's a great example of an event that has\nhugely benefited a small elite: it has bankrupted small businesses in\nfavor of Amazon, destroyed churches and mom and pop stores in favor of\npassively consooming digital infotainment from curated social media\nsites and more. It is a rationalization of state location and contact\nmonitoring and things far beyond what anyone dreamed of. It was a\nrationalization for sending out unsolicited ballots to unverified voter\nrolls which had very obvious beneficiaries. It has produced a cult of\ndoomsday believers crying for the state to lock them in their houses and\nmake them wear fetishistic masks.</p>\n<p>Seeing all this and asking who benefits, &quot;Cui bono?&quot; might lead you to\nthink that the whole thing was planned: perhaps the disease itself is\nfake, or maybe it was real, but spread on purpose, or perhaps it was\nengineered. You've probably seen stuff like this, and while I won't\ndismiss this kind of thinking out of hand, it's unnecessary.</p>\n<p>In reality, the ruling classes of the West have openly prepared to\nbenefit from a pandemic scenario. COVID19 was deemed &quot;closed enough&quot;\nto a pandemic, and the momentum of the system took over. It's not even\nthat they <em>wanted it to happen</em>, but they were prepped to benefit from\nit as a contingency plan if it might occur.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-conspiracy-rabbit-hole-and-the-omnipotent-cathedral\">The Conspiracy Rabbit Hole and the Omnipotent Cathedral</h3>\n<p>There are some people who see how the ruling class is in a position to\nbenefit from every school-shooting, police encounter, foreign\nentanglement, dissident politician and everything else and thus assume\nthat everything they see must be arranged in advance. There is a logic\nbehind believing this: it does seem <em>way</em> to convenient for all of this\nto happen at what retroactively seems to the best time, but this leads\npeople to the much more uneconomical idea that the System is so\nomnipotent that it controls every event and every reaction to every\nevent.</p>\n<p>In reality, our rulers just know how to use multiple outs. When you know\nhow to do that, it seems like you are always in control, and by nature,\npeople attribute a kind of magical power to you. All you have to do is\nstay cool and play it off like you predicted it all.</p>\n<h3 id=\"this-is-why-the-system-always-seem-to-win\">This is why &quot;the System&quot; always seem to win.</h3>\n<p><strong>The system knows how to play with multiple outs.</strong></p>\n<p>There is a canned response, or at least a reasonably ad-libbed response,\nfor every event and every possible event. They are in a position of\nantifragility and can gain from nearly any possible event. When they\ncan't, the media can at least throw enough mud on public perception to\ninspire apathy or confusion.</p>\n<p>There are certainly portions of the System which are &quot;conspiratorial.&quot;\nMajor news organizations usually coordinate on what editorial line to\npublish, but in general, their entrenched power comes from a detached\nability to be flexible in new events.</p>\n<p>The omnipotence and permanence of the Soystem is illusory. It comes from\nthat flexibility.</p>\n<h2 id=\"multiple-outs-in-your-life\">Multiple outs in your life</h2>\n<p>Even aside from politics, it's important to behave yourself in a way\nthat allow yourself to have multiple outs.

I've changed some of it and am re-adding it here. I\ntalk about the issues with Utilitarianism and a bad book by Sam Harris.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"utilitarianism\">Utilitarianism</h2>\n<p>At a dumb intuitive level, the &quot;ethical&quot; idea of\n[Utilitarianism]{.dfn} in principle gets pretty close to what most\npeople reflexively want from social-political affairs: the greatest good\nfor the greatest number of people&mdash;who doesn't want that?</p>\n<p>The problem is that that intuitive idea is <em>incoherent</em>. It sounds good,\nbut there's not really such a thing as &quot;the greatest good for the\ngreatest number of people.&quot; If there were, it wouldn't even be\nactionable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"maximizing\">&quot;Maximizing&quot;</h2>\n<p>So the first problem is one any mathematician will realize right off the\nbat: it's rarely possible to maximize a function for two variables.</p>\n<p>If we had the means, we could maximize (1) the amount of good in society\nor (2) the number of people who feel that good, but nearly certainly not\nboth (if we can it's a bizarre coincidence).</p>\n<p>It's sort of like saying you want to find a house with the highest\navailable altitude and the lowest available price; the highest house\nmight not have the lowest price and vice versa, the same way the way of\nrunning society which maximizes happiness is nearly certainly not be the\nway which maximizes all individuals' happiness.</p>\n<p>There are some classic moral puzzles that bring this out: Let's say\nthere's a city where basically everyone is in absolute ecstasy, but\ntheir ecstasy can only take place if one particular person in the city\nis in intense and indescribable pain. Or to put it another way, to\nmaximize <em>my</em> happiness, we might need to make everyone in the world my\nslave and allow me to rule as I please. Although this might maximize my\nhappiness, it might not maximize anyone else's (if it does however, we\nmight want to consider it).</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-well-being-of-conscious-creatures\">The Well-being of Conscious Creatures</h2>\n<p>So I recently read Sam Harris's <em>The Moral Landscape</em> which is either a\nfailed attempt to bring Utilitarianism back to life or a misguided book\nsimply ignorant of what the problems with it were. I don't actually\nrecall Harris using the term &quot;utilitarianism,&quot; although that is really\njust what he's arguing for.</p>\n<p>Harris repeats one mantra basically every paragraph of the book: &quot;the\nwell-being of conscious creatures&mdash;the well-being of conscious\ncreatures&mdash;the well-being of conscious creatures.&quot; In addition to\nbeing repetitive, the term is problematic for important reasons. So\nHarris wants our Utilitarian engineers to maximize &quot;the well-being of\nconscious creatures,&quot; but the problem is we can't <em>just add up</em>\nenjoyment in the first place. There's no way of taking my enjoyment of\ncandy, subtracting the pain of a broken nose and adding/subtracting an\nexistential crisis or two.</p>\n<p>Now his hope is eventually we'll understand the neurology of the brain\nenough to do just that. I don't take Harris for a fool, and he <em>does</em>\nhave a Ph.D. in neuroscience (obviously I am being sarcastic), but I\nthink he's ignoring all the important problems either to appeal to a\npublic audience or just to convince himself. We <em>can</em> study the\nneurology of feelings and get readings of neural activity, but objective\nneural activity is certainly not subjective experience. Twice as much\nneural activity doesn't mean &quot;twice&quot; the subjective experience.</p>\n<p>We can no better look at brain activation to understand subjective\nexperience any better than we can look at the hot parts of a computer to\nsee what it's doing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"you-cant-do-math-with-feelings\">You can't do math with feelings</h3>\n<p>Of course one of the problems of qualia/subjective experience is that\nthey are necessarily unquantifiable: imagine how you felt the last time\nyou got a present you really enjoyed&mdash;now imagine yourself feeling\nexactly <em>twice</em> as happy&mdash;now <em>1.5</em> times as happy&mdash;now <em>100</em> times as\nhappy.</p>\n<p>You can't do it, and even if you could, you couldn't compare that\nexperience with other experiences&mdash;you can't really understand what it\nmeans to be as happy as you were sad a month ago, and that prevents us\nfrom actually adding up your experiences into one number to be\nmaximized.</p>\n<p>But again <em>even if we could</em> it would be impossible to add that number\nup with someone else's experience. Humans have different subjective\nexperiences: caffeine affects me demonstrably different than other\npeople, but I can't quantify that; some people are more affected by\npain (to my understanding, women seem to have a neurology more\npain-prone than men), but how can we precisely relate the precise ratios\nof every individual person?</p>\n<p>And of course, although Harris wants to maximize &quot;the well-being of\n<em>conscious creatures</em>,&quot; we have no <em>clue</em> what kinds of conscious\nexperiences define animal life, or how many animals are &quot;conscious&quot; in\nany recognizable sense. As Thomas Nagel noted, we can't even begin to\nimagine what it's like to be a bat, but to quantify their experiences\nand compare them to our own? Forget about it!</p>\n<p>Douglas Adams in his <em>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em> presented the\nidea of a genetically engineered cow which not only was made to be able\nto speak, but to enjoy the prospect of being eaten and encourage others\nto kill and eat him. Experience itself is not some kind of thing arbiter\nof morality. Pain, in fact, might be a negligible or incomplete guide to\nwhat is not good. Children have to put up with being drug around to do\nmany things they don't enjoy. That doesn't mean some immorality in\nanything.</p>\n<p>The philosophical problems here are so endless as to make any kind of\nobjective application of Utilitarianism based on neuroscience far beyond\neven fancy. I will be so bold as to say that this will simply never be\npossible, regardless of what chips Elon Musk wants to put in your brain.</p>\n<h3 id=\"to-repeat\">To repeat:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We cannot quantify any particular feeling.</li>\n<li>On top of that, we cannot compare the values of different feelings.</li>\n<li>On top of that, we certainly not weigh the subjective feelings of\nall humans or beasts against other humans' feelings.</li>\n<li>On top of that, even if we could do that, we can't maximize for\nutility in such a way to maximize all individual happiness and\ncollective happiness simultaneously.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Utilitarianism isn't just impossible, it's impossible every step of\nthe way.</p>\n<p>To be clear, these are not technological problems that a future\ntotalitarian government might be able to &quot;solve.&quot; There really is no\ncoherent sense in which we can put a number to a certain feeling of\nhappiness and subtract from that another person's feeling of\nunhappiness. Qualia are qualia. It's like subtracting the sound of an\nairplane from the color blue.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-utilitarianism-really-is\">What Utilitarianism really is</h2>\n<p>Anyway, the tradition of Utilitarianism was always a failure, but it's\nan interesting sign of the times. The Enlightenment was a time of some\n(less than usually thought) scientific advancement and the idea was that\nas we began to understand the nature of the body and the stars and\neverything else, we could fully understand too human society.</p>\n<p>Eventually we could engineer and control them all. But as fast as we\nlearn things about the world, even faster do complications arise and we\nend up &quot;[restoring nature's] ultimate secrets to that obscurity, in\nwhich they ever did and ever will remain&quot; in Hume's words.</p>\n<p>The only really unfortunate thing is that the ruling class of the West\neither doesn't know or does care. There's a cynical sense in which\nthey are attempting to re-engineer or &quot;Build Back Better\u00ae\ufe0f&quot; the world\non Utilitarian principles where every decision is determined to be\nacceptable by some centralized utilitarian calculus.</p>", "age": 0, "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/the-problems-with-utilitarianism/", "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "title": "The Problems with Utilitarianism", "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "language": "en-US", "dead": false, "source": "https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml", "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2021-05-05T00:00:00+00:00", "thumbnail": null}, {"source_obj__id": 18, "tags": [], "bookmarked": true, "description": "<p>As I said <a href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/posts/monero-maximalism-or-how-bitcoin-is-a-coin\">in other writings</a> and\n<a href=\"https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/videos/watch/8ba38c94-e8c2-421f-bb5f-47f4169fa804\">videos</a>,\nno serious cryptocurrency can function <strong>in real life</strong> which is not\nalso a <em>truly private</em> cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>By far, the most popular of all these is Monero, which has already\nbecome the <em>de facto</em> currency of the dark web, but also of <em>all</em>\ncryptocurrency users <em>who actually use cryptocurrency for purposes other\nthan a mere investment</em>.</p>\n<p>Monero, however, is not actually the only private or pseudo-private\ncrypto-currency, and while I talked about its competitors in a recent\nstream, I think it's worth putting in words for a reference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"moneros-competitors\">Monero's Competitors</h2>\n<h3 id=\"zcash-is-trash\">Zcash is Trash</h3>\n\n<figure class=\"resright\"><a href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/zcashy_owned.png\"><img src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/zcashy_owned_small.png\" /></a></figure>\n\n<p><strong>Optional privacy is no privacy at all.</strong></p>\n<p>Zcash (ZEC) is often shilled as a Monero replacement. On the surface it\nactually sounds great and unambiguously better: it has a clever a\nzero-knowledge proof technology called zk-SNARKs which can store and\nprove transactions in the blockchain in a private way. zk-SNARKs are\ngenerally superior to Monero's somewhat ragtag triad of ring\nsignatures + stealth addresses + ring CT to anonymize transactions and\nthey are more scalable.</p>\n<p>zk-SNARK is short for &quot;Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument\nof Knowledge.&quot;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zero Knowledge &ndash; It is private.</li>\n<li>Succinct &ndash; Referring to computation time.</li>\n<li>Non-interactive &ndash; In some earlier implementations of the\ntechnology, the interacting parties must exchange information and\nnegotiate in turns, while zk-SNARKs can occur instantaneously.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Zcash, however, has two major problems, one substantial and one\naccidental (in the Aristotelean sense).</p>\n<p>The substantial problem is that zk-SNARKs <em>are not fully trustless</em>:\nthey require a trusted setup where public parameters are generated and\nif not properly disposed of, the initial developers could use that\nknowledge to produce infinite money without anyone knowing. This sort of\ndefeats the purpose of having a decentralized cryptocurrency and while\nthe rest of the currency is decentralized, that gaping hole certainly\nisn't.</p>\n<p>The accidental problem (or maybe <em>incidental</em> problem in modern English)\nis that Zcash is only <em>optionally private</em>. The vast majority of ZEC\ntransactions are not &quot;shielded&quot; with the zk-SNARK technology, but are\nas public as a Bitcoin transaction. <strong>This allows a third-party to\nuncover the &quot;private&quot; transactions by a process of automatic process\nof elimination.</strong></p>\n<p>Zcash, while is created valuable technology, is simply not a private\ncurrency and is not a valid competitor to Monero.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pirate-chain\">Pirate Chain</h3>\n<p>Pirate Chain (ARRR) is a minor privacy coin that has mooned\nsignificantly recently popping up from 30 cents to 14 dollars or so\n(it's halved since I started writing this article though). Pirate Chain\nuses the zk-SNARK technology, but unlike Zcash, uses it mandatorily\n(with optional transparent transactions like Monero via the private view\nkey).</p>\n<p>Pirate Chain has two big issues though. The first is what I mentioned\nbefore: zk-SNARKs as they have been implemented in ZEC and ARRR are\n<strong>not trustless</strong>. They require a setup in which theoretically, if the\npublic parameters of the system were known to some inside party, they\ncould print an infinite amount of the currency with absolutely no way\nthat any other people could know.</p>\n<p>Even if you <em>trust</em> the Pirate Chain developers, Pirate has another\npretty undeniable problem: <strong>90% of ARRR has already been mined and is\nin circulation!</strong> Yep, you heard that right: A minor niche alt-coin\nwhich has existed for only three years was put together in such away\nthat now as big of a proportion of it has been mined as has been mined\nof Bitcoin in over ten years!</p>\n<p>That means that that 90% is highly aggregated in the wallets of the two\nand a half people who knew of ARRR in this period, and anyone adding to\nthe market cap is mostly just contributing to these people's bags. Even\nif Pirate Chain had great trustless technology (which is doesn't) it\nhas not been set up equitably, but in a way that enriches early adopters\nto an extreme degree. Expect to get dumped on if you buy this stuff.</p>\n<p>Honestly, if you want a better, more honest cryptocurrency, you could\njust take the Pirate setup and give it a slower and more sane emission.\nThat would be a better choice than ARRR itself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"monero--dogecoin--bitcoin--wownero\">Monero + Dogecoin + Bitcoin = Wownero</h3>\n\n<figure class=\"resright\"><img src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/nowow.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wownero.org\">website</a> &ndash; <a href=\"https://suchwow.xyz\">meme site</a></p>\n<p>Wownero is a joke currency. It's literally a fork of Monero with\nDogecoin aesthetics and some minor additions. Like Pirate Chain, it also\nhas surged significantly recently (from 2 or 3 cents to more than a\ndollar&mdash;beating out Dogecoin as a pump-and-dump for sure).</p>\n<p>Weirdly enough, Wownero is probably the best of the alternative privacy\ncoins that I've mentioned so far. It's trustless, unlike the zk-SNARK\ncoins, but also has some nice features.</p>\n<p>It was created somewhat as a satirical response for another privacy\n\ud83d\udca9coin, MoneroV, which was just Monero with an initial coin offering and\nforked from the same blockchain (which ruins the privacy of users on\nboth chains because it becomes easier to triangulate on when outputs are\nactually spent).</p>\n<p>Since Wownero is a &quot;joke,&quot; it actually has integrated new technology\nand helpful additions <em>before</em> Monero has, since the Wownero developers\nare doing it all fast and loose. Ironically, that can be good.</p>\n<p>One principle division between Monero and Wownero is that Wownero is\nmore like Bitcoin in that it has a totally fixed supply, while Monero\nhas tail emission. Some people have criticized Monero for tail emission,\narguing that it is unnecessary and inflationary. I am not sold on either\nside: the game theoretics of this has never truly played out, but\nWownero might actually be something to look into if you like Monero, but\nthink it's &quot;inflationary.&quot; Regardless, Wownero's whitepaper and\nroadmap on their website are something that everyone should read and\ntake seriously.</p>\n<p>Again, the currency is sort of a meme, but it is what it is. I decided\nto start taking <a href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/crypto.html\">Wownero donations</a> on my site a while\nago, just for fun.</p>\n<h3 id=\"suterusu-and-the-suter-token\">Suterusu and the Suter Token</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://suterusu.io/\">website</a></p>\n<p>Now the ideal private currency would have the simple and scalable\nzk-SNARK technology implemented in a fair way and hopefully started in\nsome novel manner that is truly trustless. Suterusu is one potential\ncandidate for this kind of system. Behind it is a novel idea of\nzk-conSNARKs which can be read about in their\n<a href=\"https://github.com/suterusu-team/suterusu-documents/raw/master/Suterusu_whitepaper.pdf\">whitepaper</a>,\ntheir\n<a href=\"https://github.com/suterusu-team/suterusu-documents/raw/master/Suterusu_yellowpaper%20V%200.2.pdf\">yellowpaper</a>\nand a document on <a href=\"https://github.com/suterusu-team/suterusu-documents/raw/master/Suterusu_architecture.pdf\">Suterusu\narchitecture</a></p>\n<p>This technology hasn't been extensively vetted, but it has the\npotential to solve all the issues in privacy coins.</p>\n<p>Suterusu isn't quite meant to be an analog of Monero. The token itself\nis actually just an Ethereum token. In fact, this might be the\ninteresting part: Part of its system is that it can provide zk-conSNARK\nshielding <em>to other currencies</em> that support smart contracts. You can\nuse Suter to transact with Ethereum privately, for example.</p>\n<p>The Suterusu system, however is not perfect as far as I'm concerned. It\nisn't a self-propelling decentralized system in the way that Bitcoin or\nMonero is. That makes is regulatable and subject to human whim in a way\na cryptocurrency should not be. It is a designed system with dev taxes\nand even <a href=\"https://medium.com/suterusu/regulation-compliance-of-suterusu-625abc752eb9\">regulatory compliance that includes\nblacklisting</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"zk-snarks-vs-zk-starks\">zk-SNARKs vs. zk-STARKs</h2>\n<p>In addition to the zk-S<strong>N</strong>ARK system used in Zcash and Pirate, there\nalso exists zk-S<strong>T</strong>ARKs, which like zk-conSNARKs allow for a trustless\nsetup. <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046.pdf\">Whitepaper</a>.</p>\n<p>To repeat, zk-SNARK stands for &quot;Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive\nARguments of Knowledge.&quot; zk-S<strong>T</strong>ARK stands for &quot;Zero Knowledge\n<strong>Scalable Transparent</strong> ARguments of Knowledge.&quot; [Scalable]{.dfn}\nbecause it scales better than zk-SNARKs and [transparent]{.dfn} because\nit has a trustless setup.</p>\n<p>I do not know of a currency project that uses this technology now. Like\nzk-conSNARKs, it's only a couple years old.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-ideal-privacy-coin\">The ideal privacy coin</h2>\n<p>Would be one that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is actually private.</li>\n<li>Is trustless.</li>\n<li>Is highly scalable.</li>\n<li>Is truly decentralized and unmanaged by a singular entity.</li>\n<li>Has reasonably fair emission/mining schedule.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Monero gets only half credit on 3, but full points on the rest. Wownero\nis the same, although perhaps it should be taken less seriously as a\nDoge-tier joke. Zcash fails on 1 and 2. Pirate Chain fails on 2 and 5.\nSuterusu has great tech, but flounders on 4.</p>\n<p>So the recipe for an ideal currency is here. It is one that implements\nthe zk-conSNARK technology of Suterusu or zk-STARKs (provided that such\ntechnology is appropriately vetted), but does so in a way without\ncentralization, dev taxes and other self-refuting silliness.</p>\n<p><strong>This ideal currency might just be Monero itself</strong>, to my understanding\nMonero has contemplated integrating zk-STARKs as they become more\nwell-travelled. Such an addition, if it works, would drastically improve\nthe scalability of Monero even if it might require somewhat of an\noverhaul.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"donate\">Donate</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img

Cars today are being enriched with more and more smartphone-like features as drivers lose more and more control over their vehicles. If you bought a car anywhere in the last decade, you didn\u2019t just pay with your money. You signed up to hand over troves of data from your personal life as well. Automakers today are data companies.\n\nA modern car can generate about 4 TB of data a day. That\u2019s roughly 25 GB every hour. Automakers realize the value of this data and are beginning investing heavily to compete with software companies for ad-driven user attention. Soon, the biggest competitors of GM or BMW won\u2019t be just other car companies, but Facebook and TikTok. \n\nThe trend is irreversible. Selling data is a high-margin business, with 80- to 90-percent profit. Compared with the average profit margins of selling cars that rarely exceed double digits, understanding the drive for data is easy. It\u2019s the new currency.\n\nSources\n\nCar company profit margins: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1186661/car-company-profit-margin/ \n\nToyota Cloud city: https://www.autonews.com/article/20170710/OEM06/170719963/toyota-s-cloud-city\nBMW & Daimler partnership: https://www.seattletimes.com/business/bmw-daimler-launch-car-and-ride-sharing-joint-venture/\nCar data companies: https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/automakers-faced-with-a-choice-become-data-companies-or-become-irrelevant/\nData profit margins: https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/02/no-one-has-a-clue-whats-happening-with-their-connected-cars-data/\nCar data collection: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/03/one-company-wants-to-sell-the-feds-location-data-from-every-car-on-earth/\n- https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7adn9/car-location-data-telematics-us-military-ulysses-group\n- https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/17/what-does-your-car-know-about-you-we-hacked-chevy-find-out/\n- https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/automobiles/wheels/car-data-tracking.html \n- https://www.consumerreports.org/automotive-technology/the-cameras-in-your-car-may-be-harvesting-data-as-you-drive-a3473812015/\n- predicted value: https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/automotive%20and%20assembly/our%20insights/monetizing%20car%20data/monetizing-car-data.ashx\nWho owns your car data: https://www.consumerreports.org/automotive-technology/who-owns-the-data-your-car-collects/\nAutonomous vehicle surveillance: https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/surveillance-and-the-selfdriving-car\nhttps://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_comments/2017/11/00046-141905.pdf\nTelematics: https://www.verizonconnect.com/resources/article/what-is-telematics/\n\nInsurance and your car data: https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/car-insurance/credit-scores-affect-auto-insurance-rates/index.htm\n- https://www.chicagotribune.com/autos/sc-auto-tips-0102-driving-data-collection-20181225-story.html\n- https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/automobiles/wheels/car-data-tracking.html\n\nTesla data collection: https://www.cio.com/article/3433931/tesla-the-data-company.html\n- https://www.axios.com/what-tesla-knows-about-you-1f21d287-a204-4a6e-8b4a-0786b0afac45.html \nGM radio listening experiment: https://eu.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2018/10/01/gm-radio-listening-habits-advertising/1424294002/\nBluetooth and cars: https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/01/30/car-renters-beware-bluetooth-use-can-reveal-your-private-data/1080225001/\nMobility as a Service: https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/maas-transit-the-business-of-mobility-as-a-service/ \nPolice using private camera feeds: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/28/doorbell-camera-firm-ring-has-partnered-with-police-forces-extending-surveillance-reach/ \nSmart Driver Score: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/17/what-does-your-car-know-about-you-we-hacked-chevy-find-out/\nNegative use cases: https://www.rollcall.com/2019/04/09/your-car-is-watching-you-who-owns-the-data/\n\n\nCredits\nMusic by: CO.AG Music https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcavSftXHgxLBWwLDm_bNvA\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/TheHatedOne/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\nhttps://www.minds.com/The_HatedOne\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "age": 0, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX2SWUMt_fk", "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "title": "Your Car Is a Better Spy than Facebook", "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 2, "comments": [], "vote": 80, "page_rating": 132, "page_rating_contents": 52, "language": "en-US", "dead": false, "source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCjr2bPAyPV7t35MvcgT3W8Q", "page_rating_votes": 80, "date_published": "2021-04-09T00:00:00+00:00", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/WX2SWUMt_fk/maxresdefault.webp"}, {"tags": ["epictetus", "motivation"], "bookmarked": true, "description": "Stoicism for Inner Peace (book): https://einzelganger.co/innerpeace\n\nOur very sense of wellbeing is at gunpoint when we cling to the fickle, unreliable outside world. Around two thousand years ago, Stoic philosopher Epictetus observed that people are burdened and dragged down because they tend to care about too many things. His cure, however, is not to stop caring altogether but to care about the right things and stop clinging to anything that doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nWhat matters and doesn\u2019t matter according to Epictetus is bound to the reality of our place as reasonable beings in an ever-changing environment. This reality Epictetus makes clear in the underlying tenet of his work: \u2018the dichotomy of control.\u2019 Some things are in our control, others not. If we manage to concern ourselves with the things in our control, we are in a position of strength.\n\nBut if we neglect these things, and focus on what\u2019s not in our control, we are in a position of weakness. Especially when we cling to what\u2019s not up to us, we set ourselves up for a life of suffering. But what are those things that we cling to? And why is it better to let go of them? This video explores the philosophy of Epictetus, and what we, according to him, should focus on to be happy and content, and what we should let go of, and how we do this.\n\nSupport the channel:\n\u2714\ufe0f PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/einzelgangerco\n\u2714\ufe0f Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/einzelgangster\n\u2714\ufe0f Bitcoin: 3HQnEz1LQ4G6dqN2LdZgzc7qoJjJCyWjTC\n(Donated BTC and want in the credits?

I forget where it comes from,\nprobably a livestream, but I definitely stand by it. Since a lot of\npeople labor under the assumption that my channel is about &quot;Linux,&quot;\nI've accumulated a lot of subscribers that are variously nerds,\nfurries, degenerates, coomers, libertarians, communists, trannies and\namong them are vegans. Some of them (I assume) are good people.</p>\n<p>There's a stereotype about vegans that they are annoying and can't\ntalk about anything but Veganism. This hurtful stereotype comes from the\nfact that it's true.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"resright\"><img src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/grill.gif\" title=\"I just wanna grill!\" /></figure>\n\n<h2 id=\"bugmanism\">Bugmanism</h2>\n<p>Firstly, what is Bugmanism? How do Vegans fit the bill?</p>\n<p>Long story short, a bugman is someone who rejects the purpose and role\nof humans in their natural environment. They reject tradition, religion,\ntheir family, gender roles, the expectation that a person should\ncontribute to their community, etc. They might do this for their\npersonal convenience (usually they just wanna coom outside of marriage)\nor for apparently rational reasons, but the effect is the same.</p>\n<p>If you want to sum up the esoterically evil goals of &quot;modernism&quot; or\nwhatever you want to call it, it is destroying the countervailing power\nof tradition and in its place, new social engineers attempt to dictate\nhuman values top down. If you separate people from their families, their\nraces, their traditions and <em>who they actually are</em>, you can engineer TV\nshows, sports teams, activist movements and a million other things for\nthem to identify with and worship. <strong>Modernism pretends to liberate\npeople from arbitrary traditions and authorities, when in reality is\nsubstitutes natural, emergent morals with controlled authorities.</strong></p>\n<p>Veganism has always been one of the most radical examples of this logic.\nEsoterically, <strong>Veganism forces one to abandon not just their own\ntraditions, but every human dietary tradition</strong> and leaves them at the\nwhims of processed grains and pharmaceutical supplements for a meager\nsurvival.</p>\n<p>That is, Veganism is highly disruptive: You can't have a normal life.\nYou can't have a normal meal. You can't wine and dine with people and\nmust make it an affair. You can't use traditional hand-made leather\nproducts. You can't hunt or trap for food or raise animals, even for\neggs.</p>\n<p>You become a nag at war with your family, the world around you. <strong>You\nare trapped</strong> <em>within</em> urbanite bugman society: you can't even eat in\nmost non-urban places or foreign countries because the insane concept of\nnot cooking with animal fats and eating and using animal products just\ndoesn't exist. You have to survive holding your breath from one hipster\ndowntown area to the next.</p>\n<p>On every point, you become more reliant on macro-society. Vegans try\nvery hard to give off &quot;organic&quot; vibes, but it's just a lie. Even\npeople on the internet who &quot;advertise&quot; their Vegan lifestyle spend\nhours processing a basic meal and of course predigesting indigestible\nplant matter with a blender. Try and find a non-urbanite Vegan in real\nlife. They exist, but they are an aberration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-larp-of-vegan-for-health\">The LARP of &quot;Vegan for Health&quot;</h2>\n<p>Vegans sometimes pretend to advertise Veganism because it's allegedly\nhealthy. This is just public relations; any true Vegan, when you really\npin them down thinks that Veganism at its core is a moralistic belief.\nVegans are Vegans because they believe that not being Vegan is morally\ndeficient: killing/eating animals and using their bodies is bad. That's\nit.</p>\n<p>So you have your moral principle and run with it. What magical force\nthen is making that moral principle necessarily good for your health? If\nVeganism <em>were</em> actually a good diet for humans, that would actually be\na massive coincidence. &quot;Vegans for health&quot; have to grapple with the\nbizarre claim that meat, exactly the food that has been viewed in all\nhuman cultures as superior and more desirable is somehow nutritionally\ndeficient.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-standard-american-diet-sad-is-plant-based\">The Standard American Diet (SAD) is Plant-based.</h3>\n<p>The weirdest thing is when Veganism is held in opposition to the\nStandard American Diet, as if the American diet somehow represents\ntraditional or non-Vegan diets. <strong>The SAD is just Vegan-lite.</strong> SAD is a\npost-Vegan invention of the diet industry take over the past decades has\nbeen leading people into the most harmful parts of vegan diets: unstable\nplant-oils, processed grains as meat substitutes, etc.</p>\n<p>The pop-cultural idea of &quot;health&quot; is simply &quot;being skinny.&quot; Veganism\nis <em>great</em> at making people skinny because it is slow moving starvation\n(I have met some carbo-loading exceptions who fatten up).</p>\n<p>Veganism is just to starvation what waterboarding is to drowning. If you\nstick with it, you <em>will</em> eventually die, but it's so painful in the\nmeantime, you'll probably give up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"veganism-is-rational\">Veganism is rational.</h2>\n<p>Vegans are exceptionally &quot;rational&quot; in that they adopt the moral\nframework of modern society and follow it to its logical conclusion.</p>\n<p>When you're given for your acceptance some inane religious platitudes\nlike &quot;equality&quot; and &quot;rights&quot; along with vaguely Marxist notions of\n&quot;exploitation&quot; and &quot;slavery&quot; and &quot;oppressed classes,&quot; it seems\nperfectly reasonable to expand that language to the relationship between\npredators (humans) and their prey (many animals) (or maybe pets too).</p>\n<p>If you're raised in a time of extreme moral nihilism except for not\nliking the several historical events you're told that matter (usually\nslavery and the Holocaust), obviously you're going to glom on to what\nlooks most like them: chickens in chains and sheep being led to\nslaughter like sheep to slaughter.</p>\n<p>Honestly, Veganism by their own logic might not be far enough. There is\nsome circumstantial research to the effect that plants have nervous\nsystems that might feel pain as well: you could go one step further and\nsimply eat nothing living. The [Ctistae]{.dfn} of ancient Thrace refused\nto eat anything alive, eating only by-products/foodstuffs like milk and\nhoney. The Ctistae also refused to have sex, which might be something to\nconsider since Vegans eventually lose sexual function anyway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"veganism-is-rebellious\">Veganism is rebellious.</h2>\n<p>Veganism has the same kind of &quot;rebellion&quot; that all other forms of\nleftism share. It &quot;rebels&quot; against the system by perfectly\ninternalizing the system's values, extrapolating them to their logical\nconclusions and thus fighting the system when it fails to meet those\nobviously unworkable conclusions.</p>\n<p>Corporations started shilling vegetable oils (which originally were and\nfrankly still are just industrial by-products) as workable replacements\nfor butter and lard. Seventh-Day Adventists lobbied for them because of\ntheir own religion beliefs. Jews lobbied for them because they hate\nunkosher lard. Years later, now we know that vegetable oils are highly\nunstable and have contributed to the massive rise in heart disease.</p>\n<p>Veganism is a leftist phenomenon. The psychological type of a leftist is\nsuch that they will always subordinate their direct experience to\nideology. It doesn't matter if not eating meat or wearing leather or\nusing animal products sounds hard, their suffering is more proof of a\ngreater moral superiority.</p>\n<p>Non-leftists can simply not become Vegans for longer than extremely\nbrief periods. Even if a Vegan wins an argument with them, a normal\nperson is just going to say, &quot;I'm sorry, I like animals and all, but I\ncan't not eat them, that's just crazy.&quot;</p>\n<h2 id=\"veganism-only-makes-sense-in-a-bugman-environment\">Veganism only makes sense in a bugman environment.</h2>\n<p>Ask a vegan why he doesn't eat eggs. He will probably tell you a spooky\nstory about how terrible it must be for a chicken to live in a coop\nlaying eggs all day. That might even bring a tear to a sentimental\nperson's eye.</p>\n<p>Out where I live, people have their chickens wandering in their yards\nand garden pecking scraps. They return to their coops at night to be\nsafe from coyotes. Is there really something &quot;unethical&quot; in the mind\nof a Vegan about picking up an unfertilized egg lain by one of these\nchickens and eating it?</p>\n<p>A lot of the moral logic behind Veganism falls flat outside of bugman\ncapitalism. Fundamentally, it's another manifestation of general angst\nfrom lack of connection to the real natural world.</p>\n<p>I say this because most Vegans are Vegans because they are softies who\nhave literally no connection to animals whatsoever until as a teenager\nthey watched a PETA documentary with chickens getting their heads buzzed\noff or pigs walking around in their own poop.</p>\n<p>Literally think about the animals. When wild animals die in nature, they\ndon't slowly slip away in the night surrounded by their family. They\ndie of starvation, or by being ripped apart alive by packs of coyotes.\nWould you rather die by getting your brains blown out instantaneously or\ndie a &quot;natural&quot; death <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg9_ZnojxmU\">like\nthis</a>?</p>\n<p>But to the original question, it really makes no sense even for a Vegan\nto not eat or distribute the eggs a chicken lays... You're going to\nhave to get deep into Marxist analysis to think that's somehow\nunethical. And once a chicken has living a long life of egg laying, why\nnot quickly and painlessly <a href=\"https://poultrykeeper.com/general-chickens/how-to-kill-a-chicken/\">dislocate its\nneck</a>\nand eat it for dinner? If you don't, your cat will eventually gore it\nand it'll be a mess.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"resright\"><img src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/kill_chicken.gif\" title=\"Boomer attempts to kill chicken.\" /></figure>\n\n<h2 id=\"animals-live-to-be-eaten\">Animals live to be eaten.</h2>\n<p>This isn't even a metaphysical claim. Domesticated cows and pigs and\nchickens do not and cannot live as they exist in the wild. They have\nevolved symbiotically with us as sources of food. They can go feral and\nbreed with wild boar and the like, but their composition is based on\ntheir domesticated state.</p>\n<p>Wild game like deer have lived alongside human hunters for centuries.\nTheir breeding habits and evolutionary development is based in the fact\nthat a <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/sports/outdoors/study-sheds-light-on-top-causes-of-deer-mortality-b99190938z1-241992741.html\">sizeable\nportion</a>\nof their population will be hunted by humans every season.</p>\n<p>If you actually care about &quot;the environment&quot; (1) you would care for\nhumans, whose natural diet is meat and (2) you would be terribly worried\nabout the unintended consequences of severing one of the most important\nlinks in the food chain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dumb-vegan-sayings\">Dumb Vegan sayings</h2>\n<h3 id=\"you-wouldnt-kill-it-yourself\">&quot;You wouldn't kill it yourself!&quot;</h3>\n<p>They say this whenever someone turns their eyes away from an animal\nbeing killed in one of their Vegan propaganda videos.</p>\n<p>Guess what, I also might turn away if I see a video of a sanitation\nworker wading through human feces it in a sewer. That doesn't mean that\nI'm a hypocrite for taking dumps in a toilet connected to city sewage.</p>\n<p>I turn away when I see depictions of amputations of gangrenous limbs in\nmovies too. That doesn't mean I don't think it's not medically\nnecessary.</p>\n<p>Killing animals is actually a bad example of this because while all\ncultures are disgusted by feces and amputations, in most times and\nplaces (including this country before Bambi), killing animals was\nnothing any self-respecting grown man would react to. It goes without\nsaying that there are many countries where people recreationally torture\ndogs and cats.</p>\n<p>I don't say that to say that I'd be okay with killing dogs and cats,\nmerely that the trained moral responses we have for them are very\nlocalized and subjective in our own modernist viewpoint. But Millenials\nhave now been raised in a Disney fantasy-land where animals think and\ntalk like us and therefore must share the same feelings. Vegans absurdly\n&quot;imagine what it'd be like&quot; to live in industrial farming as if a\nchicken's birdbrain is having an existential crisis while living in a\ncage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"veganism-is-minimal-or-more-self-sufficient\">&quot;Veganism is minimal or more self-sufficient.&quot;</h3>\n<p>Vegans have been fruitlessly trying to meme this one on me for forever.\nStarvation and death is minimal, I suppose, so it is at least true in\nthat sense. <strong>Veganism is ultimately the diet of only eating inedible\ngarnish that looks &quot;good&quot; on Instagram.</strong></p>\n<p>Raising most animals is easier and more efficient than raising\nvegetables. If it's too hot, potatoes don't naturally know to go move\nto the shade. Yams don't eat your overgrown grass. Onions don't poop\nout fertilizer. Tomatoes can't pull a simple tractor. You can't skin\ndead okra and make leather out of it. You can't grind up old mustard to\nmake bonemeal (that's not just something in Minecraft, by the way).</p>\n<p>Animals are an absolutely necessary portion of any homestead in life and\ndeath. Listen, I like growing stuff. I like growing vegetables. But\nvegetables are just not real food... They are garnish. They are sides.\nThey are only enjoyable insofar as they elevate your enjoyment of real\nfood: meat.</p>\n<h3 id=\"veganism-is-more-efficient-or-environmental\">&quot;Veganism is more efficient or environmental.&quot;</h3>\n<p>People say that eating plants is more &quot;efficient&quot; because they saw an\nenergy pyramid diagram as a kid, which shows how many prey animals are\nneeded to maintain carnivorous animals. If we actually lived in a place\nwhere there was a calorie shortage, like a desert planet where greens\ncouldn't grow, that might be an issue. It frankly just isn't here.\nWe're not exactly running out of grass to feed cows. Most people are\nmowing their grass and throwing it away.</p>\n<p>There are people who make really absurd environmentalist arguments\nagainst meat as well, for example, methane from cows warms the globe.\nOkay. Fine. So what does Veganism do about that? Are Vegans going to\nkill the cows for us? Should we just let them starve in the woods since\nwe can't harvest them for meat or even milk? What about all the game we\nwon't be hunting? Those 50% of deer annually that we won't be\nkilling&mdash;won't they me causing pollution with the huge amount of\ncalories they need to frolic in the woods all days? Same will all other\ngame. Most of those arguments are cute just-so stories and they fall\napart after examination.

If you're\nfamished, it's pretty easy to eat a big steak with 2000 calories\n(around a pound and a half of matter) and it will fill you up without\nany bloating or stomach pains. You'd have to eat <em>twelve pounds</em> more\nor less of broccoli or equivalent greens for that. And with all that\nfiber, you're going to just be pooping it all out.</p>\n<p>Honestly, the human disgust response will stop you way before that.\nIt's easy to eat a juicy steak without or without sauce, salt and\npepper, but you'd nearly have to put a gun to someone's head to make\nthem eat their daily 13 pounds of indigestible garnish.</p>\n<h2 id=\"noootruits-dont-actually-matter-anyway\">Noootruits don't actually matter anyway</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Plants don't have over fifteen micro-nooootrients...&quot;\n&mdash;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGenreDoesntMatter\">sv3rige</a>, at\nthe end of every video</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A lot of Vegan autism gets focused on replicating the consumption of\nknown nutrients and minerals using only plants. The image above, in\naddition to being deceptive is based on a flawed idea that human\nnutruition is about <em>consuming particular amounts of particular\nsubstances</em> as if we are a perfectly predictable machine or a videogame.\nThis <strong>isn't just a Vegan problem</strong>, basically everyone implicitly has\nthis idea.</p>\n<p>The reality is that those nutrients on the Nutrition Facts are a narrow\nrealm of what might actually be relevant for the complex organ of our\nbodies. Additionally, there are many types of proteins and vitamins and\nminerals that the back-of-the-box doesn't account for. The Vegan game\nof saying, &quot;we can get that too&quot; is utterly pointless when you realize\nwe have nowhere close to a full idea of how the human body works, only\nsome plausible theories about the relationships between certain\nnutrients and what they seem to do. As in the case of some nutrients,\nlike the falsely-maligned cholesterol is a good example of something two\ngenerations of people were told to fear and reduce only for us to later\nrealize that our ideas about how it interacted in the body were arguably\nliterally backwards.</p>", "age": 0, "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/veganism-is-the-pinnacle-of-bugmanism/", "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "title": "Veganism Is the Pinnacle of Bugmanism", "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "language": "en-US", "dead": false, "source": "https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml", "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2021-02-11T00:00:00+00:00", "thumbnail": null}, {"tags": ["wuhan", "covid", "who", "lab leak"], "bookmarked": true, "description": "WHO says COVID-19 unlikely to have leaked from China lab", "age": 0, "link": "https://nypost.com/2021/02/09/who-team-coronavirus-unlikely-to-have-leaked-from-china-lab/", "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "rumpel", "title": "WHO says COVID-19 unlikely to have leaked from China lab", "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "language": "en-US", "dead": false, "source": "https://nypost.com", "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2021-02-09T07:26:42+00:00", "thumbnail": null}, {"tags": ["covid", "germany", "lockdown"], "bookmarked": true, "description": "Interner E-Mail-Verkehr: Innenministerium spannte Wissenschaftler ein - WELT", "age": 0, "link": "https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article225864597/Interner-E-Mail-Verkehr-Innenministerium-spannte-Wissenschaftler-ein.html", "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "rumpel", "title": "Interner E-Mail-Verkehr: Innenministerium spannte Wissenschaftler ein - WELT", "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "language": "en-US", "dead": false, "source": "https://www.welt.de", "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2021-02-07T15:02:12+00:00", "thumbnail": null}, {"tags": ["disinformation", "myanmar", "facebook"], "bookmarked": true, "description": "Ex-Google Techlead on Myanmar's blocking of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and shutting down internet access.

Wealth is good.\n&quot;Poverty&quot; (meaning low <em>per capita</em> GDP) is bad. Nowadays, pretty much\neveryone talks about &quot;economics&quot; like this as if this truism was\nscribbled on the back walls of the cosmos.</p>\n<p>This is just looking at one side of the ledger in a kind of global\ndouble-entry accounting book. A logically equivalent way of looking at\nit is that <strong>GDP is a metric of economic exchange required for survival\nin society as it exists</strong>. You can say that some area &quot;produced&quot; $1\nbillion of output (sounds good), but you can just as easily say that $1\nbillion was required for that area to sustain itself (sounds bad). These\ntwo are simply logically equivalent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"living-on-1-a-day\">Living on $1 a day</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"resright\"><a href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/ivanov01.jpg\"><img src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/ivanov01s.jpg\" title=\"(((They))) don't want you to know about this.\" /></a><figcaption>Antediluvian Hyperborea. GDP: $0 per year.</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Let's dive into the Gestalt: when you hear that a family of eight lives\non less than a dollar per day (PPP adjusted), you might wonder how they\nmanage! To <em>actually</em> do such a thing would require buying large bags of\nrice for the whole family, eat only that and live in free cardboard\nboxes.</p>\n<p>The reality is that that often uttered phrase means that they use less\nthan $1 a day in the general economy, while the rest of their\nlivelihood is &quot;off-the-grid&quot; or self-sufficient. They may grow food in\na family farm, hunt for food, and most of their daily needs from cooking\noils, to plates, to pottery, to soap are often made at home as well.</p>\n<p>There is still &quot;an economy&quot; but often one that is barter based or\n<em>socialist</em> in the real pre-socialist sense of the word: mediated by\ndirect face-to-face social tit-for-tat between neighbors and friends,\nnone of this mediated by currency being exchanged, thus it is not part\nof the GDP.</p>\n<p>If you read about some Bangladeshi village where the only product is\n&quot;textiles&quot;, that doesn't mean that everyone there makes textiles all\nday and, without a textile company, everyone would've starved to death.\nIt means that the only on-paper, measurable global industry practiced\nthere is textile manufacturing. Other villagers might farm, hunt, even\ndo some kind of gathering in some places. They will produce the arts and\ncrafts and live the way people live when you leave them alone. If your\nview of the world is mediated by GDP, you're only seeing the extremely\nsmall sliver that pops into existence when people exchange something\ninvolving legal tender.</p>\n<p>This is extremely difficult for us modern bugpeople to understand\nbecause to be a bugman in a large city is to produce absolutely nothing\non one's own and buy literally everything you need from the store. To\nus non-productive people, GDP means income which means survival. But the\nfurther out of Bugmanville you go, the clearer the vacuousness of GDP\nbecomes. When you realize that most of human wealth is unmeasured by\nGDP, you realize that Whig History and Steven Pinkerism is based on\nshaky foundations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example\">Example</h2>\n<p>A minor example. We had a large Thanksgiving feast near my uncle's\nhouse in very rural Florida. As it got cold in the night, we had a fire\nin a repurposed old sugar cane cooking vat artfully standing on used\nsymmetrical cinderblock pieces. A bugman hipster might pay two hundred\ndollars or more for a similar looking &quot;authentic&quot; piece of equipment.\nThose $200 would be counted in the GDP. A bugman hipster might have\nalso bought or rented chairs for the event, &quot;contributing&quot; more to the\nGDP, but my uncle, as part of the local wholesome church community,\nsimply borrowed some from the church. Thus our event produced basically\nno GDP output in goods or services, despite being functionally\nequivalent to some similar but expensive and ergo &quot;productive&quot;\n&quot;Friendsgiving&quot; practiced by urbanites. In reality <em>we</em> are richer\nthan the bugmen hipsters who blew hundreds of dollars on a faux-folksy\nparty. In this case, we owned the firepit and had easy access and\npermission to the chairs, thus we are more economically flexible than\nthey are. That GDP that they produced/expended is evidence of deeper\nreliance on the economic system. That GDP output is a marker of\n<em>fragility</em>, reliance on the conditions of the outside economy in the\nsame way that a village of Bangladeshis who abandon their traditional\nway of lives to work on textiles are more fragile, despite being able to\nsave up for iPhones.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-gdp-really-measures\">What GDP really measures</h2>\n<p><strong>Most of the increase in GDP across the world is simply the movement\nfrom local partially-social partially-under-the-table economies to\neconomies mediated by taxable currency.</strong> An economically\nself-sufficient village with close social relationships and a barter\neconomy has 0 GDP. A township of entrepreneurs and artisans you\npartially barter and partially use currency which they don't report has\n0 GDP. All of these people are &quot;in poverty&quot; and &quot;earn less than a\ndollar a day&quot;. And if you want to be truly self-sufficient, that means\nhaving a personal GDP of zero.</p>\n<p>More than that, pretty much everywhere, GDP is a strong indicator of\nsocial upheaval. If you think that GDP is some eternal goodness,\nremember that <em>everything &quot;good&quot; about industrialization shows up in\nthe GDP</em>, while at the same time, <em>everything bad about it will not show\nup</em>. Or, sometimes bad things are registered as positive economic\ngrowth: urbanization has caused mass-disease, and if that means a market\nfor new medical services and pharmaceuticals, great! The GDP just went\nup! The Ganges is polluted due to the textile plant? That just means\nmore opportunities for local entrepreneurs to sell bottled water! The\nGDP just went up! Are people being pushed out of fishing or other\nsubsistence occupations because of it? Even better! Now they have no\nchoice but to contribute to the GDP! With every passing year, in fact,\nmore and more of the GDP is produced by dealing with the problems that\nour higher level of GDP have caused.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, <strong>GDP is only a measurement of how reliant a\nplace or country is on the global economy</strong>. Self-sufficiency has a GDP\nof 0. Wasteful consooomerism has an extremely large GDP.</p>\n<h2 id=\"planned-obsolescence\">Planned obsolescence</h2>\n<p>I have one of my great grandfather's early electric circular saws. It\nhas a bunch of gunk in it, but it still works (although I recently took\nit apart to replace some old screws and springs and other little parts\nto be careful). They literally do not make circular saws like it; it's\nall metal, while even the fancy modern stuff is mostly plastic.</p>\n<p>The &quot;unfortunate&quot; thing about it and other durable tools is that it's\n&quot;bad for the economy,&quot; especially the GDP. Since that thing has been\naround since maybe the 50's or 60's, that's as long as 70 years the\neconomy has gone without the &quot;stimulation&quot; of us having to buy another\nsaw.</p>\n<p>Viewers of my technology videos: Which would be better for the world, if\neveryone used the material equivalent of a classic American-made IBM\nThinkPad, or some Apple Laptops that are unfixable computers made of\nmostly batteries designed to conk out right before the new version comes\nout? Regardless, the Apple Macs that cost thousands a piece are much\nbetter for the &quot;economy.&quot;</p>\n<p>That's what I mean. If you have quality tools and do not need to\nconstantly throw money at the system to buy things, fix things and\notherwise waste money, you are going to be having a lower GDP. That's\njust how it is.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-propagandistic-role-of-gdp\">The propagandistic role of GDP</h2>\n<p>When you don't think things through like this, GDP is supposed to\nappear as an objective measure of economic goodness. You're supposed to\nbe looking at those GDP charts and saying, &quot;Wow, my life might be\nterrible, I am not free, I am subject to forces out of my control, and I\nam told I have to participate in mass-consumerism to survive, but these\ncharts are the facts[!], and the facts say that things are better now,\nso I believe them!&quot;</p>\n<p>It's legitimately surprising to me how big of a boon the idea of\nincreasing GDP is for Whig history and NPCs of many different\nideologies. People of the Left and Right will matter-of-factly tell me\nthat a plastic based economy taking over the world is still good because\nthe line is going up. I've heard it as a justification for everything:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't like globalization?\n<ul>\n<li>You're wrong, the GDP is going up.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Don't trust state-funded institutionalized science?\n<ul>\n<li>You're wrong, the GDP is going up.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Don't want child drag queens?\n<ul>\n<li>You're wrong, the GDP is going up.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Don't want everything to be made of plastics and other petrochemicals?\n<ul>\n<li>You're wrong, the GDP is going up.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Don't want mass pornography?\n<ul>\n<li>You're wrong, the GDP is going up.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Don't want free sugary drinks since infancy?\n<ul>\n<li>You're wrong, the GDP is going up.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you abandon the illusion of GDP, you are suddenly able to ask\nwhether massive technological &quot;progress&quot; has <em>actually</em> been good for\nreal human life and human pychology.</p>", "age": 0, "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/why-its-bad-to-have-high-gdp/", "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "title": "Why It's Bad to Have High GDP", "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "language": "en-US", "dead": false, "source": "https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml", "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2021-01-22T00:00:00+00:00", "thumbnail": null}, {"tags": ["surveillance", "privacy", "facebook", "election"], "bookmarked": true, "description": "", "age": 0, "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2021/01/21/facebook-gives-fbi-private-messages-of-capitol-hill-protesters/", "artist": null, "album": null, "user": null, "title": "Facebook Gives FBI Private Messages of Capitol Hill Protesters", "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "language": "en", "dead": false, "source": "www.breitbart.com", "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2021-01-21T12:26:49+00:00", "thumbnail": null}, {"tags": ["covid", "vaccine"], "bookmarked": true, "description": "Fact check: Discussion of deaths in elderly vaccine recipients in Norway lacks context | Reuters", "age": 0, "link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-norway-idUSKBN29P2R1", "artist": null, "album": null, "user": "rumpel", "title": "Fact check: Discussion of deaths in elderly vaccine recipients in Norway lacks context | Reuters", "permanent": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "comments": [], "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0, "page_rating_contents": 0, "language": "en", "dead": false, "source": "https://www.reuters.com", "page_rating_votes": 0, "date_published": "2021-01-20T20:10:09+00:00", "thumbnail": null}, {"tags": ["oligarchy", "corporatocracy", "democracy", "plutocracy"], "bookmarked": true, "description": "Do We Live In A Plutocratic Oligarchy?
