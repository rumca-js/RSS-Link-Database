<item><title>![CDATA[The Underground Man - Fyodor Dostoevsky's Warning to The World]]</title><description>![CDATA[Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky wrote Notes from Underground in 1864 which is considered to be one of the first existentialist works, emphasising the importance of freedom, responsibility and individuality. It is an extraordinary piece of literature, social critique and satire of the Russian nihilist movement as well as a novel with deep psychological insights on the nature of man.

Dostoevsky’s most sustained and spirited attack on the Russian nihilist movement is voiced by one of the darkest, least sympathetic of all his characters – the nameless narrator and protagonist known as the Underground Man, revealing the hopeless dilemmas in which he lands as a result.

Notes from Underground attempts to warn people of several ideas that were gaining ground in the 1860s including: moral and political nihilism, rational egoism, determinism, utilitarianism, utopianism, atheism and what would become communism.

He is widely considered a pivotal figure in the history of Ancient Greek and Western philosophy, along with his teacher, Socrates, and his most famous student, Aristotle. Plato has also often been cited as one of the founders of Western religion and spirituality. The so-called neoplatonism of philosophers such as Plotinus and Porphyry greatly influenced Christianity through Church Fathers such as Augustine. Alfred North Whitehead once noted: "the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato." 
Plato was an innovator of the written dialogue and dialectic forms in philosophy. Plato is also considered the founder of Western political philosophy. His most famous contribution is the theory of Forms known by pure reason, in which Plato presents a solution to the problem of universals known as Platonism (also ambiguously called either Platonic realism or Platonic idealism). 
This video highlights the best quotes and saying by Plato. Enjoy!

<item><title>![CDATA[The Oakland, California Homeless Problem is Beyond Belief]]</title><description>![CDATA[Is this where America is headed? 

Oakland California sure does have a homeless problem. Driving around town, there’s homeless encampments all over the place. They’re on the side of the roads in dirt lots. There’s long stretches of them on sidewalks. Some of em are tents, some are RVs, some are actual encampments with makeshift structures where hundreds of people gather in communities.
 
It’s estimated there’s around 5,000 homeless individuals throughout the city of Oakland, but no one really knows the exact number. And the number of people on the streets in Oakland has nearly doubled in the last two years alone. 
 
A lot of that has to do with the high cost of living in the Bay Area. Apartments that were once $1,000 a month now cost closer to $3,000 a month. A lot of the homeless are addicts. But there’s no real one reason homelessness is so high in Oakland. You ask 10 homeless people why they live on the streets and you’ll get 10 different answers. 
 
Look at this one in West Oakland. This one is sort of sanctioned by the city - meaning they don’t run them off. Sometimes, it’s easier to keep them in one place so they can monitor them and provide support. But this problem is impacting the community in a big way. 
 
Local businesses complain about losing customers. I mean would you want to park near here to shop? Residents complain about homeless people stealing from them. Neighbors complain about loud noise and trash. Some say helping the homeless is backfiring.
 
And the Oakland police are already stretched thin because of low numbers. There’s many reasons for that - you know, vaccine mandates, early retirements and being defunded. 
 
I spent two days driving around Oakland, looking at how run down this once proud city has become. And along the way, I recorded all the homeless camps I saw. But there was one particular homeless camp that I stumbled onto which put into perspective the state of homelessness here in Oakland, and actually changed my perspective on the homeless problem in general.

Popper endorsed what he called "the Open Society," a liberal democratic society based on abstract and depersonalized material connections, instead of direct social relationships.</p><p>This vision was particularly influential on one of Popper's now famous students, George Soros, who would go on to use his significant wealth won in financial markets to found the Open Society Foundation, a significant source of funds for leftist political agitation and pressure in America and Europe. Soros's worldview has somewhat departed from Popper's, with an emphasis on what Soros calls <em>reflexivity</em>, the principle that in human domains, our theories of world affect the world itself.</p><h1>More...</h1><ul><li>The <em>Not Related!</em> website: <a href="https://notrelated.xyz"></a>notrelated.xyz</a></li><li>Donations will be read in the middle of each episode: <a href="https://donate.notrelated.xyz">donate.notrelated.xyz</a></li></ul>]]</description><pubDate>2021-10-31T04:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://notrelated.xyz/audio/s02/S02E05_-_Popper_Soros_and_the_Open_Society.ogg</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://notrelated.xyz/audio/s02/S02E05_-_Popper_Soros_and_the_Open_Society.ogg</guid>

Script:

Why do millions of people invest in retirement accounts?

The answer is obvious: to have money to live on when they're no longer working.

The best way for those accounts to grow is to invest in companies that make a profit. Less profit for those companies means less money for retirement.

This might seem like common sense but it's becoming less common, thanks to a new investment strategy called ESG. ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. If you're wondering what that means, you're not alone.

Generally, it means that a company's first concern should no longer be how much money it makes, but rather how much social good it does. In other words, get woke, or get shamed.

If you're an oil company, for example, you're out of luck because, by the nature of your business, it's assumed you're destroying the planet. Never mind that you're powering homes and hospitals. That doesn't count.

In fact, if you're a company just trying to make a profit, you're the problem.

ESG proponent Klaus Schwab, chairman of the World Economic Forum, puts it this way: "We can't continue with an economic system driven by selfish values, such as short-term profit..."

The message is clear: we need ESG to save us from ourselves.

Really?

The pursuit of profits has fueled many of mankind's greatest innovations and greatest companies.

It led Elon Musk to build electric cars, Andy Grove to design computer chips, and Reed Hastings to develop the world's most popular streaming service.

Everything from aspirin to commercial airplanes, to yes, solar panels and wind turbines came about because of the desire for profit.

Profit is why you have a job, clothes, a house, food, and every other necessity, not to mention luxuries.

It's the reason why you can live in Phoenix and stay cool, or live in Buffalo and stay warm.

The genius of capitalism is that it requires businesses to do good things for society to make a profit.

Think about it:

If you want to start a business—whether it's a dog hotel or a shoe factory—you'll have to create a product or service that helps others—at a price they can afford.

If you want to hire employees, you'll have to offer attractive wages and safe working conditions. Otherwise, nobody will work for you.

If you want customers, not only will you have to make a good product, but you'll need to cultivate a good reputation. That means treating those customers well and offering competitive prices.

In a free enterprise system, you can't make money without providing a social good. Capitalism is, by its very nature, conscientious.

It turns out, then, that profit isn't selfish—it motivates us to contribute our talents to help others.

ESG threatens this system. By denigrating profit, it lessens the incentive and the means to do good. Without profits, companies won't have the capital to provide jobs, pay investors, or fund innovation.

But that's the world ESG wants you to live in: a world where profit takes second place to a preoccupation with income inequality, race and gender sensitivity, and climate alarmism.

But even if you wanted to address those concerns, how would ESG help you do it?

That's a fair question because there's no consensus on ESG standards.

Here's a good example:

Three self-proclaimed ESG watchdogs have given Tesla three completely different ratings: best, worst, and middling.

In capitalism, there is a simple metric to determine success: how much money you're making.

Under ESG, there is no such thing. It's a judgment call.

To make ESG investment strategies even more problematic, according to Meir Statman, professor of finance at Santa Clara University, "in the long run, ESG investors are likely to earn lower after-fee returns than non-ESG investors." Over a period of say, 30 years, those fees alone could cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars.

So, if ESG endangers profits, offers no clear metric for success, and is a mediocre investment, why is it even a "thing?"

<item><title>![CDATA[Myth as Science and Prehistoric Knowledge: Hamlet's Mill]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Known history is less than 1% of the time humans have inhabited earth, and thus most of our past survives only in the partial evidence of myth, genetics and badly decayed archaeological remains. In particular, mythology is not just a collection of arbitrary stories, but as the authors of <em>Hamlet's Mill</em> argue, it is a long-lost theoretical language used to store astronomical and scientific knowledge.</p><p>While we all know that myth can store relevant information in a memorable format, it can also embed very specific details of a preexisting system of knowledge also attested in archaeoastronomy, even in well-known sites like Stonehenge, the "neolithic calculator" which shows astronomical knowledge far more precise than that of any average person of today.</p><p>The reason the earliest philosophical and religious mythology seems absurd or opaque to us is partially because it is speaking in a jargon which has been lost, like alchemy or primeval sciences. In the right context, we can see a long tradition of knowledge preserved from at least the Stone Age.</p><details>📚 See readings and other media.<p><em>Note that pay-walled academic articles may be obtained by feeding their URLs to sites like Sci-Hub.</em></p><ul><li><em>Hamlet's Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth</em> (Giorgio de Santillana &amp; Hertha von Dechend)</li><li><em>The Origins of Scientific Thought: from Anazimander to Proclus, 600 B.C. to 300 A.D.</em>  (Giorgio de Santillanna)</li><li><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/2021258a0">Stonehenge: A Neolithic Computer</a> (Gerald Hawkins)</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CdeBmQZ2QiCEnPQn5KQ6ov">Learn the Ancient Babylonian Math System!</a> (YouTube video series)</li></ul></details><h1>Timecodes</h1><pre>0:00:00	Issuing an Extension on Human Prehistory

Gates said Epstein had promoted himself as having relationships with people who would contribute money toward global health initiatives — a focus of Gates' foundation. "Those meetings were a mistake," Gates said. "They didn't result in what he purported and I cut them off." When asked whether there was a lesson to be learned, Gates said, "Well, he's dead. So, in general, you always have to be careful."

-----------------------
The British Pound had dominated the global economy since the early 19th century. Leaders from 44 countries met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to decide how the new global economy would run and what it’s financial bedrock would be. The Conference settled on the US Dollar as the de facto global currency. This meant that the paper money printed by one nation was used everywhere.

After JFK, the US chose a radically different economic path filled with expensive spending. The one nation the world trusted to uphold the entire financial system was drowning in debt. 

Nixon changed the very foundation of the global financial system in a total of 16 seconds. By giving the middle finger to countries wanting their gold back, as a “temporary” measure. 

For the first time in modern history, the world moved from the gold standard, to a global reserve currency not backed by anything at all, just the blind faith that the US dollar was worth something - fiat money. 

OPEC, the cartel of Arabic petroleum exporters, announced an embargo on oil sales to the US and the quadrupling of global oil prices.

Why was this so devastating? Because oil dominated every aspect of Americans’ daily lives. When OPEC exposed this giant weakness in America by restricting their oil supply, the US had to make sure something like this would never happen again. Enter - The Petrodollar

<item><title>![CDATA[Obscenities are symptoms of weak minds.]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Over the past few years, I made the decision to totally cut obscenities
out from my speech. You might actually be able to find recordings of me
cursing four or five years ago, but as of now, I really stand by my
decision.</p>
<p>Obscenities are the linguistic equivalent of an trashy emaciated person
entirely decked in tattoos, smoking cigarettes and wearing a shirt with
nudity on it. They'll defend what they do on the idea that it's
someone &quot;their right,&quot; or &quot;expression,&quot; as if they do what they do
for some lofty philosophical reason. What everyone else sees is a person
who is not in control of themselves or their vices, in fact, someone who
views their vices as a good thing.</p>
<p>There's the atomistic and nihilistic tendency to give an
&quot;intellectual&quot; argument for obscenities: &quot;What's so special,&quot; the
argument goes, &quot;about obscenities in English? They're just a
combination of arbitrary sounds! They don't have some objective magical
harm in them.&quot;</p>
<p>But the &quot;arbitrary sounds&quot; in an obscenity do indeed have a special
place in human psychology. Obscenities are produced and processed in the
brain quite differently from non-obscene language, involving the more
animalistic/reptilian parts of the brain. When assembling a well-thought
out case, there is really never a temptation to litter it with curses.</p>
<p><strong>When a person curses, it's a direct indication that they are thinking
on a lower, more reactive, more emotional level.</strong></p>
<p>I get a lot of email every day and most I don't answer for time
constraints. I've gotten good at filtering out emails, and I have
realized that obscenities are one of the best indications of a low
quality content. I haven't gone so far as to totally block curse words
with Spam Assassin, but it is genuinely rare that I receive an email of
any quality with obscenities.</p>
<p>All of this is to say that obscenities are a great indication of
reactive thinking. When someone is cursing, he is thinking at least in
part like an animal. In deciding not to curse, I have decided to be
quiet first, then only evaluate things calmly afterwards.</p>
<p>For me, there is extra reason not to curse because I am in a position of
an exemplar for many people on the internet. The internet is full of
&quot;snarky&quot; people cursing profusely and creating the idea that all
&quot;famous&quot; people should be highly arrogant and emotional.</p>
<p>There might be times when it's proper for someone to react in righteous
anger, but those are in reality so rare as to only happen in
life-and-death situations. Instead, a lot of modern nihilism is becoming
just as emotionally transfixed on minor slights and imaginary problems,
thus one spews out curses as if one is fighting some kind of crusade.
This makes profuse cursers not only the type of people who are reactive
and hard to relate to, but indicates how disordered their priorities
are.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2021-09-03T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/obscenities-are-symptoms-of-weak-minds/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/obscenities-are-symptoms-of-weak-minds/</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Every Web Browser Absolutely Sucks.]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>The title explains it all, you don't even have to read.</p>
<p>There are no good, even passable web browsers. None. Not a single one
even comes close.</p>
<p>The weird thing is this: <em>making a good browser should be easy!</em> Among
the existing web browsers, you could assemble all the parts necessary
for a passable (if not perfect) browser. No one has ever bothered to do
this, instead, people assembled 90% good stuff and 10% junk.</p>
<p>Here I will list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Features a <strong>passable</strong> browser must have.</li>
<li>Features a <strong>good</strong> browser must have.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, no browser out there has all the traits of even a passable
browser, but we might as well list them all here for the record.</p>
<h2 id="features-a-passable-browser-must-have">Features a <strong>Passable</strong> Browser must have.</h2>
<h3 id="it-must-actually-work-on-the-modern-web">It must actually work on the modern web.</h3>
<p>Sorry terminal browsers. lynx, w3m, you're out. There is some role for
you in scripting and dumping HTML email as standard output, but no can
get along using a terminal browser unless they are purposefully limiting
themselves to a very small segment of the modern web. I wish this
weren't the case, but it is.</p>
<p>Sorry also to niche independent browsers like Dillo. Nice concept, but
not usable. I don't think Dillo can even handle my simple modern CSS on
my website.</p>
<h3 id="free-and-open-source-software">Free and open source software.</h3>
<p>No reason to explain this. Absolutely insane to use a program to browse
the internet whose source code isn't publicly auditable.</p>
<h3 id="no-unsolicited-connections">No unsolicited connections.</h3>
<p>This will be <em>literally the easiest</em> point to comply with, but also the
rarest thing in browsers:</p>
<p>Don't automatically connect to Google.com or Brave.org or some stupid
start page or analytics page or Cloudflare or any other site on when I
open the browser or at anytime while browsing unless I type the address
in my URL bar.</p>
<p>Don't automatically connect to an &quot;autoupdate&quot; site, and especially
don't pull updates from it.</p>
<p>Don't send analytics. Don't <em>make</em> analytics. Actually, don't even
ask me if I want to opt in to &quot;bug reports,&quot; I don't. If something
breaks, I'll tell you.</p>
<p>If you want analytics, I want you to beg for it on an obscure Settings
page. Tell me your sob story about how it helps you get funding. And I
will <em>still</em> not give you analytics because I don't let my file
manager, email client, music player, video player, text editor or any
other random program monitor me for no reason, least of all will I allow
a browser, which often handles the most sensitive information.</p>
<p>It's a statement of just how bad the browser market is that this is
even something we're talking about.</p>
<h3 id="ad-blocking-must-come-with-the-browser">Ad-blocking must come with the browser.</h3>
<p>No one opens up a browser to view ads. This is just not why browsers
exist. No human in all of humanity has benefited from involuntary ads.
100% of people would be better off with browsers without ads, therefore,
a sensible browser should block ads.</p>
<p>This is no more controversial than saying that if you rent a server from
a company, it should come with sensible defaults, like an operating
system, a solid root password that a Chinese script-kiddy isn't going
to guess and maybe a firewall.</p>
<p>Ad-blocking must be universal, so should other sensible
&quot;add-ons&quot;/features. HTTPS everywhere is a sensible universal browser
feature as well. There are no places where using HTTP is preferrable to
using HTTPS if available. If there are reasons to ever use HTTP only or
to view ads, they are so rare as to hide them away in the Settings Menu.</p>
<p>Brave (Le Shill Lion) has at least done us the favor of blocking ads by
default (it also has HTTPS everywhere). Qutebrowser has a notional hosts
ad-blocker that allegedly blocks I guess some things, but you will still
get an add-full browsing experience. GNU Icecat has a lot of sensible
default add-ons (I forget if it blocks ads by default), but in truth,
only developers have any reasons to use bare browsers without
ad-blockers and other basic add-ons.</p>
<h3 id="basic-options">Basic options!</h3>
<p>How long has Google Chrome and its clones been around? A decade? Why has
literally no one in that period had a problem with the fact that none of
these browsers have an option <em>to not store history!</em></p>
<p>No, not Incognito mode, I want to keep cookies, but I don't want stupid
browsing history showing up whenever I start typing.</p>
<p>No, I don't just want you to not suggest previous sites, but still
store them all for some reason.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Firefox browsers at least have this basic option. Brave does
too. Ungoogled Chromium doesn't. Useless. I like that it doesn't send
my browsing history to Google and all, but I also don't want it
broadcasting it to the people over my shoulder when I type a url. I
honestly imagine that the mandatory &quot;we must keep history&quot; aspect of
Chrome is subtle social engineering. &quot;Oh you shouldn't have that
choice, you want everything you do to be stored for reference!&quot;</p>
<h4 id="internet-browser-history-is-really-obsolete">Internet browser history is really obsolete.</h4>
<p>For normies on the modern web, there is really less and less purpose of
browsing history with every passing year. In the better days of the
internet, back when <em>people actually browsed the internet</em> and you would
see dozens or hundreds of different websites a day, there is kind of a
use to a constant log of history, in case you vaguely remember seeing a
site, but couldn't remember how you got there and you couldn't search
because there were no search engines.</p>
<p>Web history is basically obsolete for 99% of people because:</p>
<ol>
<li>They use only Facebook or two other sites and quite simply never see
any of the rest of the internet.</li>
<li>Bookmarks exist and are widely used for the few sites people do use.</li>
<li>People can use a search engine to find a site.</li>
<li>They are daily watching porn or simping for instathots or doing
other abominable things for which they will be erasing their
internet history anyway.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="no-clutter-in-the-browser-experience-and-neutrality">No clutter in the browser experience and <em>Neutrality</em></h3>
<p>Brave. Lol.</p>
<p>I complimented Brave for adding ad-blockers to their browser by default.
The issue is that they also continually add more and more and more stuff
to their browser of extremely niche orientation in every single update.</p>
<p>Update Brave and there'll be some new Crypto gadget on the main screen
which is probably making some kind of unsolicited connections to
something or another. Brave has been dutiful enough to allow everything
to be disabled, but none of this is browsing related. I want a browser.
Stop giving me stuff that's not a browser. That's why I liked the idea
of the ad-block, but it looks like Brave will need a feature-block as
well.</p>
<p>Aside from Brave, about <em>every browser</em> from Pale Meme to unJewgled
Chromium has a distracting stupid start page that advertises your
history or suggests inane sites. When I open a fresh browser window,
unless I have specifically created an HTML page which I have set as my
homepage, I want to see a clean virgin page. I don't want to see giant
soy blocks that show a links to my bank account or the Bitchute
documentaries I was just watching. If I want to get there quick, I'll
bookmark it, thank you.</p>
<p>I want a browser to be <strong>neutral</strong>, not personalized. Or at least
<strong>neutral by default</strong>. I don't want it to advertise new features and
software. I don't want it to change when I visit a site.</p>
<h3 id="do-not-clutter-home">Do not clutter home!</h3>
<p>Browsers routinely make messes in home directories. XDG Compliance. Know
these directories:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>~/.config/</code> &ndash; for configuration files</li>
<li><code>~/.cache/</code> &ndash; for your cache</li>
<li><code>~/.local/share</code> &ndash; for share files</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where stuff goes so 100 useless folders don't clog up your home
when you <code>ls -a</code>. No one seems to have told this to browser developers.</p>
<p>Chromium browsers give you this useless <code>~/.pki/</code> directory. If you're
using a Furryfox clone, they are going to force at least <code>~/.mozilla/</code>
on you, but you'll also get something else. Installed Librewolf?
You'll get <code>~/.librewolf/</code> too.</p>
<p>I don't know how hardcoded Google and Mozilla made this annoyance, but
if you can deGoogle Chrome, you can use the proper XDG directories.</p>
<p>Dishonorable mention <em>definitely</em> goes to Pale Moon. Being an
independent browser, you would <em>think</em> they would jump at being less
annoying. Nope: <code>~/.Moonchild Productions</code> right in your home directory.
Capital letters and whitespace: a big eff-yew to Unix-based operating
systems. (I think they made this lower-case now?)</p>
<h3 id="must-be-written-in-a-sensible-language">Must be written in a sensible language.</h3>
<p>Aw, Dang!</p>
<p>Sorry, Qutebrowser, you thought you could make it all the way right?</p>
<p>Hey, that's okay, there are a lot of great aspects to being written in
Python: it's easier for people to play around with your config file and
script things into it, but let's be real: you're slow and buggy and
take way more system resources than a browser written in C or C++.
That's just not going to cut it for a mainstream browser that old
boomers are going to be watching YouTube and Netflix in with 250 other
open tabs.</p>
<p>Maybe if you were written in Go? Or maybe you could get compiled in
Cython or something? Idk, but as it is, it ain't cutting it.</p>
<p>Of course I realize that Qutebrowser does basically everything else
well. If I had a computer with more CPU power and RAM, I might use
Qutebrowser. It has gotten a lot better over the years.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="features-a-good-browser-must-have">Features a <strong>Good</strong> Browser must have.</h2>
<p>Now that we've ascended past the summits of the bare minimum, we might
as well discuss what additional features every browser should have.</p>
<h3 id="a-config-file">A config file.</h3>
<p>I don't care if only 2% of people know what a configuration file is,
you need one. You can keep your Settings menu for normies, but it's
nuts that browsers think it's okay to get by without a configuration
file.</p>
<p>Once someone has their browser configured, all they have to do if they
change computers or want to replicate their settings is to move one
file. Or for someone like me, who has <a href="https://larbs.xyz">people wanting to install my
system configuration a lot</a>, it would be convenient
to be able to have a single text message that assembles a browser with
sensible settings. You just can do that though. You can sorta-kinda do
that with some Furryfox settings, but for a Chromium browser, forget
about it.</p>
<p>Either way, there needs to be a simple text file that can handle setting
settings, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add-on lists including links to the source (similar to a vim plugin
manager)</li>
<li>Key bindings and custom shortcuts</li>
<li>Bookmarks</li>
<li>Search engine prefixes (combination of the two above).</li>
<li>Graphical settings, color appearance, organization of tabs and
buttons</li>
<li>Font, language</li>
</ul>
<p>Config files, even if 2% of people are going to use them now open up a
new world of sharable and editable settings. This will solve a lot of
tech support issues as well, frankly.</p>
<h3 id="actually">Actually...</h3>
<p>After the configuration file, every other feature a browser should have
comes for free. For example, it would be nice to get vim-like
key-bindings for mouseless browsing, but that is really dealt with
custom key-binds (and I suppose a link hint feature).</p>
<p>In general, I feel that once you have the sensible defaults above and
configuration file, you really have everything. Browsers suddenly become
programs with the same level of usability and customizability and
non-egregiousness of every other program on the computer.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A browser...</p>
<ol>
<li>Must actually work.</li>
<li>Must be free and open source software.</li>
<li>Must make no unsollicited connections.</li>
<li>Must block unsollicited ads and other sensible defaults.</li>
<li>Must have sensible options for history and cookies.</li>
<li>Must not be cluttered by features irrelevant to browsing.</li>
<li>Must not clutter the filesystem.</li>
<li>Must be written in a fast language light on system resources.</li>
<li>Must have a configuration file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tell me when a browser finally meets these requirements.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2021-08-28T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/every-web-browser-absolutely-sucks/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/every-web-browser-absolutely-sucks/</guid>

-----------------------
During the 2008 Meltdown when the government bailed out too-big-to-fail giants like Bear Stearns, AIG, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac - who did they hire to analyze and clean up the mess?
Another giant financial firm by the name of BlackRock, lead by a very well connected billionaire by the name of Larry Fink
BlackRock was award these key government contracts to help with the meltdown with no competitive bidding while being enveloped in secrecy
Basically, Larry Fink was hired to be the manager of Washington’s bailout of Wall Street, even though BlackRock is one of the biggest shareholders in the same banks that they were helping to bail out.

In 2020, who did the money printer of the US, the Federal Reserve, hire to manage their scheme to buy corporate bonds? (Basically, they were bailing out corporations that had too much debt or needed to borrow money)
You guessed it, they went right back to BlackRock.
Even though again, the same corporations BlackRock was helping to bailing out, were the same corporations they owned some of the biggest stakes in

And yet, despite all his considerable power, the general public has practically never heard of Larry Fink
With BlackRock barely coming into the public eye during the recent claims that they’re buying up single-family homes
That’s because Larry is smart - he’s intentionally kept it that way
He’s spent the last 33 years building BlackRock into the biggest asset manager in the world, with over $9 trillion dollars under their management
Today, BlackRock’s clients include the retirement accounts of average everyday people in the form of pension funds, they also have sovereign wealth funds as their clients, other central banks, college endowments, “Fortune 500 companies”, and millions of individual investors

This is BlackRock
What some call "the most influential financial institution in the world,"
The world's largest shadow bank,
And perhaps… the company that owns the world… 
When Larry Fink was asked by Bloomberg if it’s true that he’s the most powerful man in finance - the man responsible for $9 trillion dollars tried to convince you otherwise - that “I don’t think of myself as powerful”
Is that true? Does BlackRock own the world? Well, it’s a little complicated

Kensington Philadelphia Drug & Crime Problems

Violent crime and drug abuse in Philadelphia as a whole is a major problem. The city’s violent crime rate is higher than the national average and other similarly sized metropolitan areas.1 Also alarming is Philadelphia’s drug overdose rate. The number of drug overdose deaths in the city increased by 50% from 2013 to 2015, with more than twice as many deaths from drug overdoses as deaths from homicides in 2015.2 A big part of Philadelphia’s problems stem from the crime rate and drug abuse in Kensington. 

Because of the high number of drugs in Kensington, the neighborhood has a drug crime rate of 3.57, the third-highest rate by neighborhood in Philadelphia.3 Like a lot of the country, a big part of this issue is a result of the opioid epidemic. Opioid abuse has skyrocketed over the last two decades in the United States and Philadelphia is no exception.  Along with having a high rate of drug overdose deaths, 80% percent of Philadelphia’s overdose deaths involved opioids2 and Kensington is a big contributor to this number. This Philly neighborhood is purportedly the largest open-air narcotics market for heroin on the East Coast with many neighboring residents flocking to the area for heroin and other opioids.4 With such a high number of drugs in Kensington, many state and local officials have zoned in on this area to try and tackle Philadelphia’s problem.]]</description><pubDate>2021-07-29T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB6gwOBClwE</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB6gwOBClwE</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Modern "Freedom" Means Being a Slave to Impulses]]</title><description>![CDATA[<h2 id="what-does-freedom-mean">What does freedom mean?</h2>
<p>See this article in video form
<a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/modern-freedom-means-being-a-slave-to-impulses">here</a>.</p>
<p>Which of the following two people is more free:</p>
<ol>
<li>A drug addict.</li>
<li>A average man who is only not a drug addict because he lives in a
country where drugs are regulated or shamed in a way to make them
hard to obtain.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most modern people will have a kind of cognitive dissonance, a kind of
glitch in their matrix here. In the modern view of freedom, freedom
means the ability to do what you want without the government or society
telling you what to do, so (1), the drug addict, should be more
&quot;free.&quot;</p>
<p>But at the same time, this feels wrong. (2) probably lives a better
life. He is more suited to make more and better decisions. Someone
addicted to drugs is highly constrained in the kind of life they have to
live to fulfill their addiction.</p>
<p>Even extreme libertarians will probably say (2) is in a better place,
but might chalk things up to (1) needing to have more discipline and
they'll make up some just-so story as for why unambiguously bad drugs,
or pornography, or dangerous things should be allowed anyway.</p>
<h2 id="classical-freedom">Classical freedom</h2>

<figure class="resright"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/paul.jpg" /></figure>

<p>In reality, since the Enlightenment, we have had a hobbled understanding
of what &quot;freedom&quot; is. Enlightenment &quot;freedom&quot; is only the freedom to
perfectly follow the whims of impulses and vices indiscriminately.</p>
<h3 id="the-christian-tradition">The Christian tradition</h3>
<p>Christians stated the classical view of freedom very clearly. Paul
writes that all men are either &quot;slaves to Christ&quot; or &quot;slaves to
sin.&quot; The modern man wants to retort that he doesn't want to be a
slave to anything, but wants to be his own master, but there is really
no such thing.</p>
<p>One can be guided by Christ, or more generally, by consistent moral
principles, restraint and forethought. Or one can abandon the pretense
of morality and by definition follow his impulses to fornication,
substance-abuse, and general reckless living.</p>
<p>These masters aren't equivalent either. Being a slave to one is nothing
like being a slave to another. Slaves to sin are wrapped up into
incoherent and uncontrollable behavior. Following one's sexual whims
might be inconsistent and thoughtless behavior that one likes one second
and is disgusted by the next. It might mean someone exploding in rage
and emotion.</p>
<p>This &quot;free&quot; man, a slave to sin, is only bound by the practical
consideration that he might get caught or shamed by &quot;prudes&quot; and that
might dampen his ability to follow his inpulses more.</p>
<h3 id="impulses-are-not-the-man">Impulses are not the man</h3>

<figure class="titleimg"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/nihilism.jpg" /></figure>

<p>If we look at the modern world as if it has desires and goals for us, it
certainly seems like it is trying to induce as many people as possible
into being slave to sin. People no long have identity in who they
actually are, but in accidental preferences formed over years of
impulse-seeking: their sexual fetishes, drugs of choice, their favorite
TV show to consoom or their favorite music they constantly pump in their
head to dampen the possibility that an original reflective thought might
occur to them.</p>
<p>More than that, these people often can't even fathom of life without
their master sins, and retort in rage when someone dares to direct them
otherwise or &quot;judge&quot; them. They don't just have a kind of Stockholm
Syndrome with sin, but they can't comprehend the fact the people are
something deeper than their pleasure habits.</p>
<h3 id="control-of-impulses-leads-to-freedom">Control of Impulses Leads to Freedom</h3>
<p>However if one can constrain his impulses, he will be free to truly sit
down and deliberate and make free decisions on what is best to do.</p>
<p>This is where true freedom begins. The concept is totally alien to the
coomer, the slave to sin, because he can't even afford the mental space
to think further than his constant service to sin.</p>
<p>To him, it is merely &quot;me having fun,&quot; versus &quot;some haters who are
against fun.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="slaves-to-vices-are-slaves-in-general">Slaves to Vices are Slaves in General</h2>

<figure class="titleimg"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/fedora_consoomer.jpg" /></figure>

<p>If you indentify with your impulses, it's very easy to get you
motivated to defend them with the same impulsivity if you are told that
they are &quot;under attack.&quot; While impulsive people might be hard to be
around as individuals, they are easy to control as groups and can be
herded around like unthinking sheep.</p>
<p>People who are reactive in politics are always the losers, and what is
an impulsive life but one that is entirely reactive and therefore
controllable?</p>
<h2 id="the-kingly-state">The Kingly State</h2>
<p>With the classical understanding of freedom, the goal of social
conventions, traditional morality and the good government is to increase
true liberty by minimizing one's temptation to vice. People are born
with some tendency to vice (original sin to Chrisitians) that can be
easily made worse. The goal of normal society is to lead people away
from lasciviousness and impulsive behavior. (That is clearly not the
goal of the modern West, however.)</p>
<p>A drug addict is not free. A teenager who gets home from school
everyday, closes his door and watches internet pornography is not free.
A person who compulsively checks their social media feed when they wake
up or are minorly bored is not free. A woman who sleeps around
throughout her twenties and is left with nothing is not free. A boy who
stays up late because he has to &quot;grind&quot; on a video game is not free.</p>
<p>No one can say that these people truly want what they do: no one <em>fully</em>
consents to any impulsive behavior. This is actually why in the Catholic
tradition, sins of incontinence are not as grave as deliberate sins.
It's not a fair game.</p>
<p>Either way, the goal of the church, or a moral society and moral
government generally, is to increase freedom by being a countervailing
power to inborn vices.</p>
<p>The point of moral instruction is not to restrain man, but to make him
more free by eliminating the true causes of his enslavement: his vices,
his bad habits, his sexual paraphilias, his gluttony and greed.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2021-05-06T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/modern-freedom-means-being-a-slave-to-impulses/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/modern-freedom-means-being-a-slave-to-impulses/</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Conspiratorial Thinking and "Multiple Outs"]]</title><description>![CDATA[<h2 id="how-to-do-magic-tricks">How to do magic tricks...</h2>
<p>Magicians have this concept called &quot;Multiple Outs.&quot; It's actually how
you can do simple magic tricks. Suppose you have a person pick a card
and say you will guess the suit of their card.</p>
<p>They pick a diamond card and announce it, and you tell them to check
underneath their chair to reveal a slip of paper that says, &quot;You will
pick a diamond card.&quot;</p>
<p>That might sound like a nice trick, but if they had picked a spade, you
have another piece of paper under the fruitbowl that says, &quot;You will
pick a spade.&quot; If they pick a club, you unbutton your shirt to reveal a
giant club written on your undershirt, etc.</p>
<p>In essence, for any possible outcomes, you have a response planned that
seems natural and predictive. This is one of the ways that magicians do
what they do, often with more complicated mechanisms.</p>
<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
<p>Multiple outs are actually real magic.</p>
<p>You've heard the expression &quot;hope for the best and plan for the
worst,&quot; but the concept of multiple outs is that one should be planning
for <em>all possible</em> outcomes, including those that you yourself might not
even anticipate now.</p>
<p>Every business plan should have multiple outs. Your major life decisions
should be planned with multiple outs. You should even tacitly plan dates
with multiple outs, so that unexpected events can be met with a
confident, perhaps even better replacements.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-outs-in-political-power">Multiple outs in political power</h2>
<p>Any longstanding group in political power is by the mere fact of their
survival sure to have mastered the sleight of hand of &quot;multiple outs.&quot;</p>
<p>This serves not only to continue in political power, but to cement their
power further by the appearance of inevitability. A ruler or ruling
class puts themselves in a position to benefit from any possible
occurrence: be ready even to use disaster to your benefit, as Obama's
chief of staff Rahm Emmanuel put it succinctly: &quot;You never let a
serious crisis go to waste.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="conspiracy">Conspiracy?</h3>
<p>People skeptical of the state sometimes devolve into thinking that every
major political event is in one way or another is planned in advance.
This is because they don't understand and apply the concept of multiple
outs. They see that their rulers are good at benefiting from any chaos
or unforeseen events, so assume these events must've been engineered.</p>
<p>Look at the corona virus: it's a great example of an event that has
hugely benefited a small elite: it has bankrupted small businesses in
favor of Amazon, destroyed churches and mom and pop stores in favor of
passively consooming digital infotainment from curated social media
sites and more. It is a rationalization of state location and contact
monitoring and things far beyond what anyone dreamed of. It was a
rationalization for sending out unsolicited ballots to unverified voter
rolls which had very obvious beneficiaries. It has produced a cult of
doomsday believers crying for the state to lock them in their houses and
make them wear fetishistic masks.</p>
<p>Seeing all this and asking who benefits, &quot;Cui bono?&quot; might lead you to
think that the whole thing was planned: perhaps the disease itself is
fake, or maybe it was real, but spread on purpose, or perhaps it was
engineered. You've probably seen stuff like this, and while I won't
dismiss this kind of thinking out of hand, it's unnecessary.</p>
<p>In reality, the ruling classes of the West have openly prepared to
benefit from a pandemic scenario. COVID19 was deemed &quot;closed enough&quot;
to a pandemic, and the momentum of the system took over. It's not even
that they <em>wanted it to happen</em>, but they were prepped to benefit from
it as a contingency plan if it might occur.</p>
<h3 id="the-conspiracy-rabbit-hole-and-the-omnipotent-cathedral">The Conspiracy Rabbit Hole and the Omnipotent Cathedral</h3>
<p>There are some people who see how the ruling class is in a position to
benefit from every school-shooting, police encounter, foreign
entanglement, dissident politician and everything else and thus assume
that everything they see must be arranged in advance. There is a logic
behind believing this: it does seem <em>way</em> to convenient for all of this
to happen at what retroactively seems to the best time, but this leads
people to the much more uneconomical idea that the System is so
omnipotent that it controls every event and every reaction to every
event.</p>
<p>In reality, our rulers just know how to use multiple outs. When you know
how to do that, it seems like you are always in control, and by nature,
people attribute a kind of magical power to you. All you have to do is
stay cool and play it off like you predicted it all.</p>
<h3 id="this-is-why-the-system-always-seem-to-win">This is why &quot;the System&quot; always seem to win.</h3>
<p><strong>The system knows how to play with multiple outs.</strong></p>
<p>There is a canned response, or at least a reasonably ad-libbed response,
for every event and every possible event. They are in a position of
antifragility and can gain from nearly any possible event. When they
can't, the media can at least throw enough mud on public perception to
inspire apathy or confusion.</p>
<p>There are certainly portions of the System which are &quot;conspiratorial.&quot;
Major news organizations usually coordinate on what editorial line to
publish, but in general, their entrenched power comes from a detached
ability to be flexible in new events.</p>
<p>The omnipotence and permanence of the Soystem is illusory. It comes from
that flexibility.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-outs-in-your-life">Multiple outs in your life</h2>
<p>Even aside from politics, it's important to behave yourself in a way
that allow yourself to have multiple outs. Business, social life, major
decisions and in everything else. Never tether yourself to one option;
that's when you lose. Have a smart response to co-opt anything that can
happen, no matter how good or bad.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2021-05-05T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/conspiratorial-thinking-and-multiple-outs/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/conspiratorial-thinking-and-multiple-outs/</guid>
<item><title>![CDATA[The Problems with Utilitarianism]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>I originally wrote this essay in 2014 or 2015 in a Chinese buffet in
Athens, Georgia. I've changed some of it and am re-adding it here. I
talk about the issues with Utilitarianism and a bad book by Sam Harris.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</h2>
<p>At a dumb intuitive level, the &quot;ethical&quot; idea of
[Utilitarianism]{.dfn} in principle gets pretty close to what most
people reflexively want from social-political affairs: the greatest good
for the greatest number of people&mdash;who doesn't want that?</p>
<p>The problem is that that intuitive idea is <em>incoherent</em>. It sounds good,
but there's not really such a thing as &quot;the greatest good for the
greatest number of people.&quot; If there were, it wouldn't even be
actionable.</p>
<h2 id="maximizing">&quot;Maximizing&quot;</h2>
<p>So the first problem is one any mathematician will realize right off the
bat: it's rarely possible to maximize a function for two variables.</p>
<p>If we had the means, we could maximize (1) the amount of good in society
or (2) the number of people who feel that good, but nearly certainly not
both (if we can it's a bizarre coincidence).</p>
<p>It's sort of like saying you want to find a house with the highest
available altitude and the lowest available price; the highest house
might not have the lowest price and vice versa, the same way the way of
running society which maximizes happiness is nearly certainly not be the
way which maximizes all individuals' happiness.</p>
<p>There are some classic moral puzzles that bring this out: Let's say
there's a city where basically everyone is in absolute ecstasy, but
their ecstasy can only take place if one particular person in the city
is in intense and indescribable pain. Or to put it another way, to
maximize <em>my</em> happiness, we might need to make everyone in the world my
slave and allow me to rule as I please. Although this might maximize my
happiness, it might not maximize anyone else's (if it does however, we
might want to consider it).</p>
<h2 id="the-well-being-of-conscious-creatures">The Well-being of Conscious Creatures</h2>
<p>So I recently read Sam Harris's <em>The Moral Landscape</em> which is either a
failed attempt to bring Utilitarianism back to life or a misguided book
simply ignorant of what the problems with it were. I don't actually
recall Harris using the term &quot;utilitarianism,&quot; although that is really
just what he's arguing for.</p>
<p>Harris repeats one mantra basically every paragraph of the book: &quot;the
well-being of conscious creatures&mdash;the well-being of conscious
creatures&mdash;the well-being of conscious creatures.&quot; In addition to
being repetitive, the term is problematic for important reasons. So
Harris wants our Utilitarian engineers to maximize &quot;the well-being of
conscious creatures,&quot; but the problem is we can't <em>just add up</em>
enjoyment in the first place. There's no way of taking my enjoyment of
candy, subtracting the pain of a broken nose and adding/subtracting an
existential crisis or two.</p>
<p>Now his hope is eventually we'll understand the neurology of the brain
enough to do just that. I don't take Harris for a fool, and he <em>does</em>
have a Ph.D. in neuroscience (obviously I am being sarcastic), but I
think he's ignoring all the important problems either to appeal to a
public audience or just to convince himself. We <em>can</em> study the
neurology of feelings and get readings of neural activity, but objective
neural activity is certainly not subjective experience. Twice as much
neural activity doesn't mean &quot;twice&quot; the subjective experience.</p>
<p>We can no better look at brain activation to understand subjective
experience any better than we can look at the hot parts of a computer to
see what it's doing.</p>
<h3 id="you-cant-do-math-with-feelings">You can't do math with feelings</h3>
<p>Of course one of the problems of qualia/subjective experience is that
they are necessarily unquantifiable: imagine how you felt the last time
you got a present you really enjoyed&mdash;now imagine yourself feeling
exactly <em>twice</em> as happy&mdash;now <em>1.5</em> times as happy&mdash;now <em>100</em> times as
happy.</p>
<p>You can't do it, and even if you could, you couldn't compare that
experience with other experiences&mdash;you can't really understand what it
means to be as happy as you were sad a month ago, and that prevents us
from actually adding up your experiences into one number to be
maximized.</p>
<p>But again <em>even if we could</em> it would be impossible to add that number
up with someone else's experience. Humans have different subjective
experiences: caffeine affects me demonstrably different than other
people, but I can't quantify that; some people are more affected by
pain (to my understanding, women seem to have a neurology more
pain-prone than men), but how can we precisely relate the precise ratios
of every individual person?</p>
<p>And of course, although Harris wants to maximize &quot;the well-being of
<em>conscious creatures</em>,&quot; we have no <em>clue</em> what kinds of conscious
experiences define animal life, or how many animals are &quot;conscious&quot; in
any recognizable sense. As Thomas Nagel noted, we can't even begin to
imagine what it's like to be a bat, but to quantify their experiences
and compare them to our own? Forget about it!</p>
<p>Douglas Adams in his <em>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em> presented the
idea of a genetically engineered cow which not only was made to be able
to speak, but to enjoy the prospect of being eaten and encourage others
to kill and eat him. Experience itself is not some kind of thing arbiter
of morality. Pain, in fact, might be a negligible or incomplete guide to
what is not good. Children have to put up with being drug around to do
many things they don't enjoy. That doesn't mean some immorality in
anything.</p>
<p>The philosophical problems here are so endless as to make any kind of
objective application of Utilitarianism based on neuroscience far beyond
even fancy. I will be so bold as to say that this will simply never be
possible, regardless of what chips Elon Musk wants to put in your brain.</p>
<h3 id="to-repeat">To repeat:</h3>
<ul>
<li>We cannot quantify any particular feeling.</li>
<li>On top of that, we cannot compare the values of different feelings.</li>
<li>On top of that, we certainly not weigh the subjective feelings of
all humans or beasts against other humans' feelings.</li>
<li>On top of that, even if we could do that, we can't maximize for
utility in such a way to maximize all individual happiness and
collective happiness simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<p>Utilitarianism isn't just impossible, it's impossible every step of
the way.</p>
<p>To be clear, these are not technological problems that a future
totalitarian government might be able to &quot;solve.&quot; There really is no
coherent sense in which we can put a number to a certain feeling of
happiness and subtract from that another person's feeling of
unhappiness. Qualia are qualia. It's like subtracting the sound of an
airplane from the color blue.</p>
<h2 id="what-utilitarianism-really-is">What Utilitarianism really is</h2>
<p>Anyway, the tradition of Utilitarianism was always a failure, but it's
an interesting sign of the times. The Enlightenment was a time of some
(less than usually thought) scientific advancement and the idea was that
as we began to understand the nature of the body and the stars and
everything else, we could fully understand too human society.</p>
<p>Eventually we could engineer and control them all. But as fast as we
learn things about the world, even faster do complications arise and we
end up &quot;[restoring nature's] ultimate secrets to that obscurity, in
which they ever did and ever will remain&quot; in Hume's words.</p>
<p>The only really unfortunate thing is that the ruling class of the West
either doesn't know or does care. There's a cynical sense in which
they are attempting to re-engineer or &quot;Build Back Better®️&quot; the world
on Utilitarian principles where every decision is determined to be
acceptable by some centralized utilitarian calculus.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2021-05-05T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/the-problems-with-utilitarianism/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/the-problems-with-utilitarianism/</guid>
<item><title>![CDATA[Monero and Other Privacy Coins]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>As I said <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/posts/monero-maximalism-or-how-bitcoin-is-a-coin">in other writings</a> and
<a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/videos/watch/8ba38c94-e8c2-421f-bb5f-47f4169fa804">videos</a>,
no serious cryptocurrency can function <strong>in real life</strong> which is not
also a <em>truly private</em> cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>By far, the most popular of all these is Monero, which has already
become the <em>de facto</em> currency of the dark web, but also of <em>all</em>
cryptocurrency users <em>who actually use cryptocurrency for purposes other
than a mere investment</em>.</p>
<p>Monero, however, is not actually the only private or pseudo-private
crypto-currency, and while I talked about its competitors in a recent
stream, I think it's worth putting in words for a reference.</p>
<h2 id="moneros-competitors">Monero's Competitors</h2>
<h3 id="zcash-is-trash">Zcash is Trash</h3>

<figure class="resright"><a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/zcashy_owned.png"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/zcashy_owned_small.png" /></a></figure>

<p><strong>Optional privacy is no privacy at all.</strong></p>
<p>Zcash (ZEC) is often shilled as a Monero replacement. On the surface it
actually sounds great and unambiguously better: it has a clever a
zero-knowledge proof technology called zk-SNARKs which can store and
prove transactions in the blockchain in a private way. zk-SNARKs are
generally superior to Monero's somewhat ragtag triad of ring
signatures + stealth addresses + ring CT to anonymize transactions and
they are more scalable.</p>
<p>zk-SNARK is short for &quot;Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument
of Knowledge.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Zero Knowledge &ndash; It is private.</li>
<li>Succinct &ndash; Referring to computation time.</li>
<li>Non-interactive &ndash; In some earlier implementations of the
technology, the interacting parties must exchange information and
negotiate in turns, while zk-SNARKs can occur instantaneously.</li>
</ul>
<p>Zcash, however, has two major problems, one substantial and one
accidental (in the Aristotelean sense).</p>
<p>The substantial problem is that zk-SNARKs <em>are not fully trustless</em>:
they require a trusted setup where public parameters are generated and
if not properly disposed of, the initial developers could use that
knowledge to produce infinite money without anyone knowing. This sort of
defeats the purpose of having a decentralized cryptocurrency and while
the rest of the currency is decentralized, that gaping hole certainly
isn't.</p>
<p>The accidental problem (or maybe <em>incidental</em> problem in modern English)
is that Zcash is only <em>optionally private</em>. The vast majority of ZEC
transactions are not &quot;shielded&quot; with the zk-SNARK technology, but are
as public as a Bitcoin transaction. <strong>This allows a third-party to
uncover the &quot;private&quot; transactions by a process of automatic process
of elimination.</strong></p>
<p>Zcash, while is created valuable technology, is simply not a private
currency and is not a valid competitor to Monero.</p>
<h3 id="pirate-chain">Pirate Chain</h3>
<p>Pirate Chain (ARRR) is a minor privacy coin that has mooned
significantly recently popping up from 30 cents to 14 dollars or so
(it's halved since I started writing this article though). Pirate Chain
uses the zk-SNARK technology, but unlike Zcash, uses it mandatorily
(with optional transparent transactions like Monero via the private view
key).</p>
<p>Pirate Chain has two big issues though. The first is what I mentioned
before: zk-SNARKs as they have been implemented in ZEC and ARRR are
<strong>not trustless</strong>. They require a setup in which theoretically, if the
public parameters of the system were known to some inside party, they
could print an infinite amount of the currency with absolutely no way
that any other people could know.</p>
<p>Even if you <em>trust</em> the Pirate Chain developers, Pirate has another
pretty undeniable problem: <strong>90% of ARRR has already been mined and is
in circulation!</strong> Yep, you heard that right: A minor niche alt-coin
which has existed for only three years was put together in such away
that now as big of a proportion of it has been mined as has been mined
of Bitcoin in over ten years!</p>
<p>That means that that 90% is highly aggregated in the wallets of the two
and a half people who knew of ARRR in this period, and anyone adding to
the market cap is mostly just contributing to these people's bags. Even
if Pirate Chain had great trustless technology (which is doesn't) it
has not been set up equitably, but in a way that enriches early adopters
to an extreme degree. Expect to get dumped on if you buy this stuff.</p>
<p>Honestly, if you want a better, more honest cryptocurrency, you could
just take the Pirate setup and give it a slower and more sane emission.
That would be a better choice than ARRR itself.</p>
<h3 id="monero--dogecoin--bitcoin--wownero">Monero + Dogecoin + Bitcoin = Wownero</h3>

<figure class="resright"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/nowow.jpg" /></figure>

<p><a href="https://wownero.org">website</a> &ndash; <a href="https://suchwow.xyz">meme site</a></p>
<p>Wownero is a joke currency. It's literally a fork of Monero with
Dogecoin aesthetics and some minor additions. Like Pirate Chain, it also
has surged significantly recently (from 2 or 3 cents to more than a
dollar&mdash;beating out Dogecoin as a pump-and-dump for sure).</p>
<p>Weirdly enough, Wownero is probably the best of the alternative privacy
coins that I've mentioned so far. It's trustless, unlike the zk-SNARK
coins, but also has some nice features.</p>
<p>It was created somewhat as a satirical response for another privacy
💩coin, MoneroV, which was just Monero with an initial coin offering and
forked from the same blockchain (which ruins the privacy of users on
both chains because it becomes easier to triangulate on when outputs are
actually spent).</p>
<p>Since Wownero is a &quot;joke,&quot; it actually has integrated new technology
and helpful additions <em>before</em> Monero has, since the Wownero developers
are doing it all fast and loose. Ironically, that can be good.</p>
<p>One principle division between Monero and Wownero is that Wownero is
more like Bitcoin in that it has a totally fixed supply, while Monero
has tail emission. Some people have criticized Monero for tail emission,
arguing that it is unnecessary and inflationary. I am not sold on either
side: the game theoretics of this has never truly played out, but
Wownero might actually be something to look into if you like Monero, but
think it's &quot;inflationary.&quot; Regardless, Wownero's whitepaper and
roadmap on their website are something that everyone should read and
take seriously.</p>
<p>Again, the currency is sort of a meme, but it is what it is. I decided
to start taking <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/crypto.html">Wownero donations</a> on my site a while
ago, just for fun.</p>
<h3 id="suterusu-and-the-suter-token">Suterusu and the Suter Token</h3>
<p><a href="https://suterusu.io/">website</a></p>
<p>Now the ideal private currency would have the simple and scalable
zk-SNARK technology implemented in a fair way and hopefully started in
some novel manner that is truly trustless. Suterusu is one potential
candidate for this kind of system. Behind it is a novel idea of
zk-conSNARKs which can be read about in their
<a href="https://github.com/suterusu-team/suterusu-documents/raw/master/Suterusu_whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a>,
their
<a href="https://github.com/suterusu-team/suterusu-documents/raw/master/Suterusu_yellowpaper%20V%200.2.pdf">yellowpaper</a>
and a document on <a href="https://github.com/suterusu-team/suterusu-documents/raw/master/Suterusu_architecture.pdf">Suterusu
architecture</a></p>
<p>This technology hasn't been extensively vetted, but it has the
potential to solve all the issues in privacy coins.</p>
<p>Suterusu isn't quite meant to be an analog of Monero. The token itself
is actually just an Ethereum token. In fact, this might be the
interesting part: Part of its system is that it can provide zk-conSNARK
shielding <em>to other currencies</em> that support smart contracts. You can
use Suter to transact with Ethereum privately, for example.</p>
<p>The Suterusu system, however is not perfect as far as I'm concerned. It
isn't a self-propelling decentralized system in the way that Bitcoin or
Monero is. That makes is regulatable and subject to human whim in a way
a cryptocurrency should not be. It is a designed system with dev taxes
and even <a href="https://medium.com/suterusu/regulation-compliance-of-suterusu-625abc752eb9">regulatory compliance that includes
blacklisting</a>.</p>
<h2 id="zk-snarks-vs-zk-starks">zk-SNARKs vs. zk-STARKs</h2>
<p>In addition to the zk-S<strong>N</strong>ARK system used in Zcash and Pirate, there
also exists zk-S<strong>T</strong>ARKs, which like zk-conSNARKs allow for a trustless
setup. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046.pdf">Whitepaper</a>.</p>
<p>To repeat, zk-SNARK stands for &quot;Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive
ARguments of Knowledge.&quot; zk-S<strong>T</strong>ARK stands for &quot;Zero Knowledge
<strong>Scalable Transparent</strong> ARguments of Knowledge.&quot; [Scalable]{.dfn}
because it scales better than zk-SNARKs and [transparent]{.dfn} because
it has a trustless setup.</p>
<p>I do not know of a currency project that uses this technology now. Like
zk-conSNARKs, it's only a couple years old.</p>
<h2 id="the-ideal-privacy-coin">The ideal privacy coin</h2>
<p>Would be one that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is actually private.</li>
<li>Is trustless.</li>
<li>Is highly scalable.</li>
<li>Is truly decentralized and unmanaged by a singular entity.</li>
<li>Has reasonably fair emission/mining schedule.</li>
</ol>
<p>Monero gets only half credit on 3, but full points on the rest. Wownero
is the same, although perhaps it should be taken less seriously as a
Doge-tier joke. Zcash fails on 1 and 2. Pirate Chain fails on 2 and 5.
Suterusu has great tech, but flounders on 4.</p>
<p>So the recipe for an ideal currency is here. It is one that implements
the zk-conSNARK technology of Suterusu or zk-STARKs (provided that such
technology is appropriately vetted), but does so in a way without
centralization, dev taxes and other self-refuting silliness.</p>
<p><strong>This ideal currency might just be Monero itself</strong>, to my understanding
Monero has contemplated integrating zk-STARKs as they become more
well-travelled. Such an addition, if it works, would drastically improve
the scalability of Monero even if it might require somewhat of an
overhaul.</p>

Do we need nuclear energy to stop climate change? More and more voices from science, environmental activists and the press have been saying so in recent years – but this comes as a shock to those who are fighting against nuclear energy and the problems that come with it. So who is right? Well - it is complicated.

Car companies are adopting the Silicon Valley business model to gradually transform drivers into users. Cars today are being enriched with more and more smartphone-like features as drivers lose more and more control over their vehicles. If you bought a car anywhere in the last decade, you didn’t just pay with your money. You signed up to hand over troves of data from your personal life as well. Automakers today are data companies.

A modern car can generate about 4 TB of data a day. That’s roughly 25 GB every hour. Automakers realize the value of this data and are beginning investing heavily to compete with software companies for ad-driven user attention. Soon, the biggest competitors of GM or BMW won’t be just other car companies, but Facebook and TikTok. 

The trend is irreversible. Selling data is a high-margin business, with 80- to 90-percent profit. Compared with the average profit margins of selling cars that rarely exceed double digits, understanding the drive for data is easy. It’s the new currency.

<item><title>![CDATA[When Life Hurts, Stop Clinging to It | The Philosophy of Epictetus]]</title><description>![CDATA[Stoicism for Inner Peace (book): https://einzelganger.co/innerpeace

Our very sense of wellbeing is at gunpoint when we cling to the fickle, unreliable outside world. Around two thousand years ago, Stoic philosopher Epictetus observed that people are burdened and dragged down because they tend to care about too many things. His cure, however, is not to stop caring altogether but to care about the right things and stop clinging to anything that doesn’t matter.

What matters and doesn’t matter according to Epictetus is bound to the reality of our place as reasonable beings in an ever-changing environment. This reality Epictetus makes clear in the underlying tenet of his work: ‘the dichotomy of control.’ Some things are in our control, others not. If we manage to concern ourselves with the things in our control, we are in a position of strength.

But if we neglect these things, and focus on what’s not in our control, we are in a position of weakness. Especially when we cling to what’s not up to us, we set ourselves up for a life of suffering. But what are those things that we cling to? And why is it better to let go of them? This video explores the philosophy of Epictetus, and what we, according to him, should focus on to be happy and content, and what we should let go of, and how we do this.

<item><title>![CDATA[YouTube Channel Deletion]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>Google is prepping to delete my YouTube channel. As of today (March 26,
2021), I now cannot post for another two weeks. YouTube &quot;strikes&quot;
which are functionally unappealable (automatically rejected) last for 3
months. If they give thee concurrent strikes, you channel is permanently
deleted.</p>
<p>If YouTube Jannies delete my YouTube channel, remember that <strong>100% of my
videos are still easily viewable, including new videos I will make</strong>.
You have no excuse to whine if all you know how to do is consoooming
product on YouTube's walled garden:</p>

<li>Follow me on RSS: <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml">https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I can and have already done livestreams on
<a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz">PeerTube</a>. Expect those as well.
LBRY/Odysee will probably have livestreams too soon.</p>
<h2 id="when-youre-banned-from-youtube-will-you-keep-making-videos">&quot;When you're banned from YouTube will you keep making videos?&quot;</h2>
<p>Yes, at <a href="https://odysee.com/@Luke:7">Odysee</a> and
<a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz">PeerTube</a>. I will also probably actually
bring back <a href="https://notrelated.xyz">Not Related!</a> for real this time
because the first reason I made a podcast was to communicate with people
using less bandwidth.</p>
<p>I suppose my only regret is not shilling RSS, webrings and other
classical internet technology to free us from social media companies.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-youtube">The &quot;importance&quot; of YouTube</h2>
<p>YouTube ad revenue by itself is a nice thing to have, but it is not a
huge loss if I lose it (less than minimum wagies make). Very few
megachannels actually make decent money on it and frankly, it's a kind
of bloodmoney if you ask me.</p>
<p>The only concern for me is that YouTube is still the vehicle by which
people find out about me and use other stuff I offer and that can mean
other sources of income for me.</p>
<p>While I try to push people into a decentralized internet, use RSS feeds,
superior platforms like Odysee and PeerTube, and encourage them to have
websites and the like, most people still passively use YouTube
recommendations and curation.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-they-giving-you-strikes-for">&quot;What are they giving you strikes for?&quot;</h2>
<p>To be clear, before this year, I never received any strikes, but now
I've received a warning and two strikes <em>all for old videos</em>.</p>
<p>I will emphasize that this is merely the sign of either: (1) coordinated
third-party mass-reports or (2) YouTube specifically and arbitrarily
adopting new standards in a bid to remove the channel.</p>
<p>The strikes are for the following very innocent videos:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a video I put up in either 2016 or 2017 where I made an ffmpeg
slideshow with a bunch of Pepe memes set to music. Deleted for
&quot;inciting violence.&quot; I can't find the original video of this, I
might've deleted it.</li>
<li>For a video I did sometime in 2020 when I in passing made jokes
about low-quality Indian tech channels that used to dominate
YouTube. Deleted for &quot;inciting violence.&quot;
<a href="https://odysee.com/@Luke:7/thanks-luke-for-vanquishing-pajeettube:f">Here</a>
is the video so you can see how innocuous (also true) it was.</li>
<li>For a video I made maybe in 2018 or 2019 on <code>youtube-dl</code>.
<a href="https://odysee.com/@Luke:7/downloading-videos-music-and-more-with:5">Here</a>
is the video. The absurdity is that I recommend people to use this
tool to back up my YouTube channel (and all of my videos are in
licensed permissively via Creative Commons). I guess it's a crime
to distribute my own videos on a video distribution platform!</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the arbitrariness of Google today. If my channel survives the
storm of these strikes (which I severely doubt) expect me to be using
<a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz">PeerTube</a> and
<a href="https://odysee.com/@Luke:7">Odysee</a> as primary platforms. From now on,
my YouTube exists to lead people to more healthy places.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2021-03-26T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/updates/deletion/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/updates/deletion/</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Veganism Is the Pinnacle of Bugmanism]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>People have quoted me as saying that. I forget where it comes from,
probably a livestream, but I definitely stand by it. Since a lot of
people labor under the assumption that my channel is about &quot;Linux,&quot;
I've accumulated a lot of subscribers that are variously nerds,
furries, degenerates, coomers, libertarians, communists, trannies and
among them are vegans. Some of them (I assume) are good people.</p>
<p>There's a stereotype about vegans that they are annoying and can't
talk about anything but Veganism. This hurtful stereotype comes from the
fact that it's true.</p>

<figure class="resright"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/grill.gif" title="I just wanna grill!" /></figure>

<h2 id="bugmanism">Bugmanism</h2>
<p>Firstly, what is Bugmanism? How do Vegans fit the bill?</p>
<p>Long story short, a bugman is someone who rejects the purpose and role
of humans in their natural environment. They reject tradition, religion,
their family, gender roles, the expectation that a person should
contribute to their community, etc. They might do this for their
personal convenience (usually they just wanna coom outside of marriage)
or for apparently rational reasons, but the effect is the same.</p>
<p>If you want to sum up the esoterically evil goals of &quot;modernism&quot; or
whatever you want to call it, it is destroying the countervailing power
of tradition and in its place, new social engineers attempt to dictate
human values top down. If you separate people from their families, their
races, their traditions and <em>who they actually are</em>, you can engineer TV
shows, sports teams, activist movements and a million other things for
them to identify with and worship. <strong>Modernism pretends to liberate
people from arbitrary traditions and authorities, when in reality is
substitutes natural, emergent morals with controlled authorities.</strong></p>
<p>Veganism has always been one of the most radical examples of this logic.
Esoterically, <strong>Veganism forces one to abandon not just their own
traditions, but every human dietary tradition</strong> and leaves them at the
whims of processed grains and pharmaceutical supplements for a meager
survival.</p>
<p>That is, Veganism is highly disruptive: You can't have a normal life.
You can't have a normal meal. You can't wine and dine with people and
must make it an affair. You can't use traditional hand-made leather
products. You can't hunt or trap for food or raise animals, even for
eggs.</p>
<p>You become a nag at war with your family, the world around you. <strong>You
are trapped</strong> <em>within</em> urbanite bugman society: you can't even eat in
most non-urban places or foreign countries because the insane concept of
not cooking with animal fats and eating and using animal products just
doesn't exist. You have to survive holding your breath from one hipster
downtown area to the next.</p>
<p>On every point, you become more reliant on macro-society. Vegans try
very hard to give off &quot;organic&quot; vibes, but it's just a lie. Even
people on the internet who &quot;advertise&quot; their Vegan lifestyle spend
hours processing a basic meal and of course predigesting indigestible
plant matter with a blender. Try and find a non-urbanite Vegan in real
life. They exist, but they are an aberration.</p>
<h2 id="the-larp-of-vegan-for-health">The LARP of &quot;Vegan for Health&quot;</h2>
<p>Vegans sometimes pretend to advertise Veganism because it's allegedly
healthy. This is just public relations; any true Vegan, when you really
pin them down thinks that Veganism at its core is a moralistic belief.
Vegans are Vegans because they believe that not being Vegan is morally
deficient: killing/eating animals and using their bodies is bad. That's
it.</p>
<p>So you have your moral principle and run with it. What magical force
then is making that moral principle necessarily good for your health? If
Veganism <em>were</em> actually a good diet for humans, that would actually be
a massive coincidence. &quot;Vegans for health&quot; have to grapple with the
bizarre claim that meat, exactly the food that has been viewed in all
human cultures as superior and more desirable is somehow nutritionally
deficient.</p>
<h3 id="the-standard-american-diet-sad-is-plant-based">The Standard American Diet (SAD) is Plant-based.</h3>
<p>The weirdest thing is when Veganism is held in opposition to the
Standard American Diet, as if the American diet somehow represents
traditional or non-Vegan diets. <strong>The SAD is just Vegan-lite.</strong> SAD is a
post-Vegan invention of the diet industry take over the past decades has
been leading people into the most harmful parts of vegan diets: unstable
plant-oils, processed grains as meat substitutes, etc.</p>
<p>The pop-cultural idea of &quot;health&quot; is simply &quot;being skinny.&quot; Veganism
is <em>great</em> at making people skinny because it is slow moving starvation
(I have met some carbo-loading exceptions who fatten up).</p>
<p>Veganism is just to starvation what waterboarding is to drowning. If you
stick with it, you <em>will</em> eventually die, but it's so painful in the
meantime, you'll probably give up.</p>
<h2 id="veganism-is-rational">Veganism is rational.</h2>
<p>Vegans are exceptionally &quot;rational&quot; in that they adopt the moral
framework of modern society and follow it to its logical conclusion.</p>
<p>When you're given for your acceptance some inane religious platitudes
like &quot;equality&quot; and &quot;rights&quot; along with vaguely Marxist notions of
&quot;exploitation&quot; and &quot;slavery&quot; and &quot;oppressed classes,&quot; it seems
perfectly reasonable to expand that language to the relationship between
predators (humans) and their prey (many animals) (or maybe pets too).</p>
<p>If you're raised in a time of extreme moral nihilism except for not
liking the several historical events you're told that matter (usually
slavery and the Holocaust), obviously you're going to glom on to what
looks most like them: chickens in chains and sheep being led to
slaughter like sheep to slaughter.</p>
<p>Honestly, Veganism by their own logic might not be far enough. There is
some circumstantial research to the effect that plants have nervous
systems that might feel pain as well: you could go one step further and
simply eat nothing living. The [Ctistae]{.dfn} of ancient Thrace refused
to eat anything alive, eating only by-products/foodstuffs like milk and
honey. The Ctistae also refused to have sex, which might be something to
consider since Vegans eventually lose sexual function anyway.</p>
<h2 id="veganism-is-rebellious">Veganism is rebellious.</h2>
<p>Veganism has the same kind of &quot;rebellion&quot; that all other forms of
leftism share. It &quot;rebels&quot; against the system by perfectly
internalizing the system's values, extrapolating them to their logical
conclusions and thus fighting the system when it fails to meet those
obviously unworkable conclusions.</p>
<p>Corporations started shilling vegetable oils (which originally were and
frankly still are just industrial by-products) as workable replacements
for butter and lard. Seventh-Day Adventists lobbied for them because of
their own religion beliefs. Jews lobbied for them because they hate
unkosher lard. Years later, now we know that vegetable oils are highly
unstable and have contributed to the massive rise in heart disease.</p>
<p>Veganism is a leftist phenomenon. The psychological type of a leftist is
such that they will always subordinate their direct experience to
ideology. It doesn't matter if not eating meat or wearing leather or
using animal products sounds hard, their suffering is more proof of a
greater moral superiority.</p>
<p>Non-leftists can simply not become Vegans for longer than extremely
brief periods. Even if a Vegan wins an argument with them, a normal
person is just going to say, &quot;I'm sorry, I like animals and all, but I
can't not eat them, that's just crazy.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="veganism-only-makes-sense-in-a-bugman-environment">Veganism only makes sense in a bugman environment.</h2>
<p>Ask a vegan why he doesn't eat eggs. He will probably tell you a spooky
story about how terrible it must be for a chicken to live in a coop
laying eggs all day. That might even bring a tear to a sentimental
person's eye.</p>
<p>Out where I live, people have their chickens wandering in their yards
and garden pecking scraps. They return to their coops at night to be
safe from coyotes. Is there really something &quot;unethical&quot; in the mind
of a Vegan about picking up an unfertilized egg lain by one of these
chickens and eating it?</p>
<p>A lot of the moral logic behind Veganism falls flat outside of bugman
capitalism. Fundamentally, it's another manifestation of general angst
from lack of connection to the real natural world.</p>
<p>I say this because most Vegans are Vegans because they are softies who
have literally no connection to animals whatsoever until as a teenager
they watched a PETA documentary with chickens getting their heads buzzed
off or pigs walking around in their own poop.</p>
<p>Literally think about the animals. When wild animals die in nature, they
don't slowly slip away in the night surrounded by their family. They
die of starvation, or by being ripped apart alive by packs of coyotes.
Would you rather die by getting your brains blown out instantaneously or
die a &quot;natural&quot; death <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg9_ZnojxmU">like
this</a>?</p>
<p>But to the original question, it really makes no sense even for a Vegan
to not eat or distribute the eggs a chicken lays... You're going to
have to get deep into Marxist analysis to think that's somehow
unethical. And once a chicken has living a long life of egg laying, why
not quickly and painlessly <a href="https://poultrykeeper.com/general-chickens/how-to-kill-a-chicken/">dislocate its
neck</a>
and eat it for dinner? If you don't, your cat will eventually gore it
and it'll be a mess.</p>

<figure class="resright"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/kill_chicken.gif" title="Boomer attempts to kill chicken." /></figure>

<h2 id="animals-live-to-be-eaten">Animals live to be eaten.</h2>
<p>This isn't even a metaphysical claim. Domesticated cows and pigs and
chickens do not and cannot live as they exist in the wild. They have
evolved symbiotically with us as sources of food. They can go feral and
breed with wild boar and the like, but their composition is based on
their domesticated state.</p>
<p>Wild game like deer have lived alongside human hunters for centuries.
Their breeding habits and evolutionary development is based in the fact
that a <a href="http://archive.jsonline.com/sports/outdoors/study-sheds-light-on-top-causes-of-deer-mortality-b99190938z1-241992741.html">sizeable
portion</a>
of their population will be hunted by humans every season.</p>
<p>If you actually care about &quot;the environment&quot; (1) you would care for
humans, whose natural diet is meat and (2) you would be terribly worried
about the unintended consequences of severing one of the most important
links in the food chain.</p>
<h2 id="dumb-vegan-sayings">Dumb Vegan sayings</h2>
<h3 id="you-wouldnt-kill-it-yourself">&quot;You wouldn't kill it yourself!&quot;</h3>
<p>They say this whenever someone turns their eyes away from an animal
being killed in one of their Vegan propaganda videos.</p>
<p>Guess what, I also might turn away if I see a video of a sanitation
worker wading through human feces it in a sewer. That doesn't mean that
I'm a hypocrite for taking dumps in a toilet connected to city sewage.</p>
<p>I turn away when I see depictions of amputations of gangrenous limbs in
movies too. That doesn't mean I don't think it's not medically
necessary.</p>
<p>Killing animals is actually a bad example of this because while all
cultures are disgusted by feces and amputations, in most times and
places (including this country before Bambi), killing animals was
nothing any self-respecting grown man would react to. It goes without
saying that there are many countries where people recreationally torture
dogs and cats.</p>
<p>I don't say that to say that I'd be okay with killing dogs and cats,
merely that the trained moral responses we have for them are very
localized and subjective in our own modernist viewpoint. But Millenials
have now been raised in a Disney fantasy-land where animals think and
talk like us and therefore must share the same feelings. Vegans absurdly
&quot;imagine what it'd be like&quot; to live in industrial farming as if a
chicken's birdbrain is having an existential crisis while living in a
cage.</p>
<h3 id="veganism-is-minimal-or-more-self-sufficient">&quot;Veganism is minimal or more self-sufficient.&quot;</h3>
<p>Vegans have been fruitlessly trying to meme this one on me for forever.
Starvation and death is minimal, I suppose, so it is at least true in
that sense. <strong>Veganism is ultimately the diet of only eating inedible
garnish that looks &quot;good&quot; on Instagram.</strong></p>
<p>Raising most animals is easier and more efficient than raising
vegetables. If it's too hot, potatoes don't naturally know to go move
to the shade. Yams don't eat your overgrown grass. Onions don't poop
out fertilizer. Tomatoes can't pull a simple tractor. You can't skin
dead okra and make leather out of it. You can't grind up old mustard to
make bonemeal (that's not just something in Minecraft, by the way).</p>
<p>Animals are an absolutely necessary portion of any homestead in life and
death. Listen, I like growing stuff. I like growing vegetables. But
vegetables are just not real food... They are garnish. They are sides.
They are only enjoyable insofar as they elevate your enjoyment of real
food: meat.</p>
<h3 id="veganism-is-more-efficient-or-environmental">&quot;Veganism is more efficient or environmental.&quot;</h3>
<p>People say that eating plants is more &quot;efficient&quot; because they saw an
energy pyramid diagram as a kid, which shows how many prey animals are
needed to maintain carnivorous animals. If we actually lived in a place
where there was a calorie shortage, like a desert planet where greens
couldn't grow, that might be an issue. It frankly just isn't here.
We're not exactly running out of grass to feed cows. Most people are
mowing their grass and throwing it away.</p>
<p>There are people who make really absurd environmentalist arguments
against meat as well, for example, methane from cows warms the globe.
Okay. Fine. So what does Veganism do about that? Are Vegans going to
kill the cows for us? Should we just let them starve in the woods since
we can't harvest them for meat or even milk? What about all the game we
won't be hunting? Those 50% of deer annually that we won't be
killing&mdash;won't they me causing pollution with the huge amount of
calories they need to frolic in the woods all days? Same will all other
game. Most of those arguments are cute just-so stories and they fall
apart after examination. Anyone can play that game.</p>
<h2 id="lets-just-laugh-at-this-for-a-minute">Let's just laugh at this for a minute...</h2>
<p>Alright class, look at this commonly posted vegan meme and tell me why
it's retarded:</p>

<figure class="titleimg"><a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/vegan_protein.jpeg"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/vegan_protein.jpeg" /></a></figure>

<p>&quot;Per 100 calories&quot; shows a deception so insane you should laugh.
Whoever made this image wants you to <em>believe</em> that the piece of steak
on the fork is equivalent to the tiny broccoli head on the right.</p>
<p>You can compare the nutrition of both
<a href="https://www.calorieking.com/us/en/foods/f/calories-in-fresh-or-dried-vegetables-broccoli-raw/uhZAljTASPuU9YnkyCZdFA">broccoli</a>
and
<a href="https://www.calorieking.com/us/en/foods/f/calories-in-beef-ground-beef-80-lean-20-fat-pan-browned/MJPo9HnUSnGiV2-9eBsCBw">beef</a>
at those links yourself.</p>
<p><strong>In order to get the protein in a single large bite of steak, you'll
have to eat more than half a pound of broccoli.</strong> Good luck. Now you
know why those poor impressionable girls who go vegan bloat up. And
that's only 100 calories. 2000 calorie diet? Have fun. If you're
famished, it's pretty easy to eat a big steak with 2000 calories
(around a pound and a half of matter) and it will fill you up without
any bloating or stomach pains. You'd have to eat <em>twelve pounds</em> more
or less of broccoli or equivalent greens for that. And with all that
fiber, you're going to just be pooping it all out.</p>
<p>Honestly, the human disgust response will stop you way before that.
It's easy to eat a juicy steak without or without sauce, salt and
pepper, but you'd nearly have to put a gun to someone's head to make
them eat their daily 13 pounds of indigestible garnish.</p>
<h2 id="noootruits-dont-actually-matter-anyway">Noootruits don't actually matter anyway</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Plants don't have over fifteen micro-nooootrients...&quot;
&mdash;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGenreDoesntMatter">sv3rige</a>, at
the end of every video</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of Vegan autism gets focused on replicating the consumption of
known nutrients and minerals using only plants. The image above, in
addition to being deceptive is based on a flawed idea that human
nutruition is about <em>consuming particular amounts of particular
substances</em> as if we are a perfectly predictable machine or a videogame.
This <strong>isn't just a Vegan problem</strong>, basically everyone implicitly has
this idea.</p>
<p>The reality is that those nutrients on the Nutrition Facts are a narrow
realm of what might actually be relevant for the complex organ of our
bodies. Additionally, there are many types of proteins and vitamins and
minerals that the back-of-the-box doesn't account for. The Vegan game
of saying, &quot;we can get that too&quot; is utterly pointless when you realize
we have nowhere close to a full idea of how the human body works, only
some plausible theories about the relationships between certain
nutrients and what they seem to do. As in the case of some nutrients,
like the falsely-maligned cholesterol is a good example of something two
generations of people were told to fear and reduce only for us to later
realize that our ideas about how it interacted in the body were arguably
literally backwards.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2021-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/veganism-is-the-pinnacle-of-bugmanism/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/veganism-is-the-pinnacle-of-bugmanism/</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Why It's Bad to Have High GDP]]</title><description>![CDATA[<h2 id="to-put-it-in-other-words">To put it in other words...</h2>
<p>The common way of looking at Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is that it's
a metric of economic success: more GDP is more wealth. Wealth is good.
&quot;Poverty&quot; (meaning low <em>per capita</em> GDP) is bad. Nowadays, pretty much
everyone talks about &quot;economics&quot; like this as if this truism was
scribbled on the back walls of the cosmos.</p>
<p>This is just looking at one side of the ledger in a kind of global
double-entry accounting book. A logically equivalent way of looking at
it is that <strong>GDP is a metric of economic exchange required for survival
in society as it exists</strong>. You can say that some area &quot;produced&quot; $1
billion of output (sounds good), but you can just as easily say that $1
billion was required for that area to sustain itself (sounds bad). These
two are simply logically equivalent.</p>
<h2 id="living-on-1-a-day">Living on $1 a day</h2>

<figure class="resright"><a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/ivanov01.jpg"><img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/ivanov01s.jpg" title="(((They))) don't want you to know about this." /></a><figcaption>Antediluvian Hyperborea. GDP: $0 per year.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Let's dive into the Gestalt: when you hear that a family of eight lives
on less than a dollar per day (PPP adjusted), you might wonder how they
manage! To <em>actually</em> do such a thing would require buying large bags of
rice for the whole family, eat only that and live in free cardboard
boxes.</p>
<p>The reality is that that often uttered phrase means that they use less
than $1 a day in the general economy, while the rest of their
livelihood is &quot;off-the-grid&quot; or self-sufficient. They may grow food in
a family farm, hunt for food, and most of their daily needs from cooking
oils, to plates, to pottery, to soap are often made at home as well.</p>
<p>There is still &quot;an economy&quot; but often one that is barter based or
<em>socialist</em> in the real pre-socialist sense of the word: mediated by
direct face-to-face social tit-for-tat between neighbors and friends,
none of this mediated by currency being exchanged, thus it is not part
of the GDP.</p>
<p>If you read about some Bangladeshi village where the only product is
&quot;textiles&quot;, that doesn't mean that everyone there makes textiles all
day and, without a textile company, everyone would've starved to death.
It means that the only on-paper, measurable global industry practiced
there is textile manufacturing. Other villagers might farm, hunt, even
do some kind of gathering in some places. They will produce the arts and
crafts and live the way people live when you leave them alone. If your
view of the world is mediated by GDP, you're only seeing the extremely
small sliver that pops into existence when people exchange something
involving legal tender.</p>
<p>This is extremely difficult for us modern bugpeople to understand
because to be a bugman in a large city is to produce absolutely nothing
on one's own and buy literally everything you need from the store. To
us non-productive people, GDP means income which means survival. But the
further out of Bugmanville you go, the clearer the vacuousness of GDP
becomes. When you realize that most of human wealth is unmeasured by
GDP, you realize that Whig History and Steven Pinkerism is based on
shaky foundations.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>A minor example. We had a large Thanksgiving feast near my uncle's
house in very rural Florida. As it got cold in the night, we had a fire
in a repurposed old sugar cane cooking vat artfully standing on used
symmetrical cinderblock pieces. A bugman hipster might pay two hundred
dollars or more for a similar looking &quot;authentic&quot; piece of equipment.
Those $200 would be counted in the GDP. A bugman hipster might have
also bought or rented chairs for the event, &quot;contributing&quot; more to the
GDP, but my uncle, as part of the local wholesome church community,
simply borrowed some from the church. Thus our event produced basically
no GDP output in goods or services, despite being functionally
equivalent to some similar but expensive and ergo &quot;productive&quot;
&quot;Friendsgiving&quot; practiced by urbanites. In reality <em>we</em> are richer
than the bugmen hipsters who blew hundreds of dollars on a faux-folksy
party. In this case, we owned the firepit and had easy access and
permission to the chairs, thus we are more economically flexible than
they are. That GDP that they produced/expended is evidence of deeper
reliance on the economic system. That GDP output is a marker of
<em>fragility</em>, reliance on the conditions of the outside economy in the
same way that a village of Bangladeshis who abandon their traditional
way of lives to work on textiles are more fragile, despite being able to
save up for iPhones.</p>
<h2 id="what-gdp-really-measures">What GDP really measures</h2>
<p><strong>Most of the increase in GDP across the world is simply the movement
from local partially-social partially-under-the-table economies to
economies mediated by taxable currency.</strong> An economically
self-sufficient village with close social relationships and a barter
economy has 0 GDP. A township of entrepreneurs and artisans you
partially barter and partially use currency which they don't report has
0 GDP. All of these people are &quot;in poverty&quot; and &quot;earn less than a
dollar a day&quot;. And if you want to be truly self-sufficient, that means
having a personal GDP of zero.</p>
<p>More than that, pretty much everywhere, GDP is a strong indicator of
social upheaval. If you think that GDP is some eternal goodness,
remember that <em>everything &quot;good&quot; about industrialization shows up in
the GDP</em>, while at the same time, <em>everything bad about it will not show
up</em>. Or, sometimes bad things are registered as positive economic
growth: urbanization has caused mass-disease, and if that means a market
for new medical services and pharmaceuticals, great! The GDP just went
up! The Ganges is polluted due to the textile plant? That just means
more opportunities for local entrepreneurs to sell bottled water! The
GDP just went up! Are people being pushed out of fishing or other
subsistence occupations because of it? Even better! Now they have no
choice but to contribute to the GDP! With every passing year, in fact,
more and more of the GDP is produced by dealing with the problems that
our higher level of GDP have caused.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, <strong>GDP is only a measurement of how reliant a
place or country is on the global economy</strong>. Self-sufficiency has a GDP
of 0. Wasteful consooomerism has an extremely large GDP.</p>
<h2 id="planned-obsolescence">Planned obsolescence</h2>
<p>I have one of my great grandfather's early electric circular saws. It
has a bunch of gunk in it, but it still works (although I recently took
it apart to replace some old screws and springs and other little parts
to be careful). They literally do not make circular saws like it; it's
all metal, while even the fancy modern stuff is mostly plastic.</p>
<p>The &quot;unfortunate&quot; thing about it and other durable tools is that it's
&quot;bad for the economy,&quot; especially the GDP. Since that thing has been
around since maybe the 50's or 60's, that's as long as 70 years the
economy has gone without the &quot;stimulation&quot; of us having to buy another
saw.</p>
<p>Viewers of my technology videos: Which would be better for the world, if
everyone used the material equivalent of a classic American-made IBM
ThinkPad, or some Apple Laptops that are unfixable computers made of
mostly batteries designed to conk out right before the new version comes
out? Regardless, the Apple Macs that cost thousands a piece are much
better for the &quot;economy.&quot;</p>
<p>That's what I mean. If you have quality tools and do not need to
constantly throw money at the system to buy things, fix things and
otherwise waste money, you are going to be having a lower GDP. That's
just how it is.</p>
<h2 id="the-propagandistic-role-of-gdp">The propagandistic role of GDP</h2>
<p>When you don't think things through like this, GDP is supposed to
appear as an objective measure of economic goodness. You're supposed to
be looking at those GDP charts and saying, &quot;Wow, my life might be
terrible, I am not free, I am subject to forces out of my control, and I
am told I have to participate in mass-consumerism to survive, but these
charts are the facts[!], and the facts say that things are better now,
so I believe them!&quot;</p>
<p>It's legitimately surprising to me how big of a boon the idea of
increasing GDP is for Whig history and NPCs of many different
ideologies. People of the Left and Right will matter-of-factly tell me
that a plastic based economy taking over the world is still good because
the line is going up. I've heard it as a justification for everything:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't like globalization?
<ul>
<li>You're wrong, the GDP is going up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't trust state-funded institutionalized science?
<ul>
<li>You're wrong, the GDP is going up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't want child drag queens?
<ul>
<li>You're wrong, the GDP is going up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't want everything to be made of plastics and other petrochemicals?
<ul>
<li>You're wrong, the GDP is going up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't want mass pornography?
<ul>
<li>You're wrong, the GDP is going up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't want free sugary drinks since infancy?
<ul>
<li>You're wrong, the GDP is going up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you abandon the illusion of GDP, you are suddenly able to ask
whether massive technological &quot;progress&quot; has <em>actually</em> been good for
real human life and human pychology.</p>]]</description><pubDate>2021-01-22T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/why-its-bad-to-have-high-gdp/</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/why-its-bad-to-have-high-gdp/</guid>
