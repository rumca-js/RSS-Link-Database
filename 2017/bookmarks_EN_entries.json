The release of his first debut album titled, \u201cMunarvagr\u201d have gathered around 4 million streams in one year. The second album \"Mannavegr\" was released November 1, 2017.\n\nDanheim's music is dark yet melodic, intense yet authentic. While drawing strongly from nordic pagan culture and his Danish heritage, Danheim's sound is ultimately deeply rooted in ancient Scandinavian folklore and Viking inspired lore and stories.\n\n\nSong list:\n00:00 # Danheim - Holmgang\n03:14 # Danheim - Heljarf\u00f6r (Sigurbodi Vocal Version)\n07:27 # Danheim - Gripir (Sigurbodi Vocal Version)\n11:11 # Danheim - Folkvangr\n15:04 # Danheim - Fensalir\n19:30 # Danheim & Sigurbodi - Glundro\u00f0i\n24:27 # Danheim - Vali\n28:10 # Danheim - N\u00f3at\u00fan\n31:53 # Danheim - Ivar's Wrath\n35:42 # Danheim - Mannavegr\n38:57 # Danheim - War of the North\n43:31 # Danheim - Vanheimr\n47:31 # Danheim - Gripir\n51:15 # Danheim - Heljarf\u00f6r\n55:25 # Danheim - \u00cdmar", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tilKaOINmE", "date_published": "2017-11-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["full album", "music"]}, {"source": "http://www.coalpha.org", "title": "Google as a search engine is becoming useless", "description": "CoAlpha Reactionary Forum - Google as a search engine is becoming useless", "link": "http://www.coalpha.org/Google-as-a-search-engine-is-becoming-useless-td7576886.html", "date_published": "2017-10-23 16:30:02+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["search engines"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCerMB0mEB6rFywnPVLUWONA", "title": "Eye Symbolism in Blade Runner 2049 Explained || Hidden Messages Analysis", "description": "Eye Symbolism in Blade Runner 2049 Explained || Hidden Messages Analysis", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRSZd8xYaL4", "date_published": "2017-10-22 20:18:50+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-EN", "tags": ["blade runner", "symbolism", "movies"]}, {"source": "www.palestinechronicle.com", "title": "USA: Hurricane Harvey Victims Told: Boycott Israel and You Won\u2019t Get Aid Donations", "description": "", "link": "https://www.palestinechronicle.com/hurricane-harvey-victims-told-boycott-israel-and-you-wont-get-aid-donations/", "date_published": "2017-10-21 12:52:50+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["israel"]}, {"source": "https://www.eweek.com", "title": "Ubuntu 17.10 Linux Debuts Without Unity but With New Logs App", "description": "Ubuntu 17.10 Linux Debuts Without Unity but With New Logs App", "link": "https://www.eweek.com/enterprise-apps/ubuntu-drops-unity-for-gnome-in-artful-aardvark-release/", "date_published": "2017-10-18 16:02:27+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["ubuntu", "canonical"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC6-ymYjG0SU0jUWnWh9ZzEQ", "title": "Blade Runner 2049: Do Memories Make Us Human? \u2013 Wisecrack Quick Take", "description": "Blade Runner 2049: Do Memories Make Us Human? \u2013 Wisecrack Quick Take", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqDO9LyvXPQ", "date_published": "2017-10-13 20:19:38+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-EN", "tags": ["blade runner", "movies"]}, {"source": "https://www.theatlantic.com", "title": "What Facebook Did to American Democracy", "description": "What Facebook Did to American Democracy", "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/what-facebook-did/542502/", "date_published": "2017-10-12 11:16:55+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["facebook", "democracy", "election", "corporatocracy", "privacy", "social media"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC_SD8q_CLdAoeb1_uiJOvmA", "title": "Jordan Peterson - Gay Marriage", "description": "Jordan Peterson - Gay Marriage", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jef2C4T1_A", "date_published": "2017-10-04 20:58:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["homosexuality", "the left wing", "lgbt", "jordan peterson"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Chronixx: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert", "description": "Sept. 27, 2017 | Abby O'Neill -- Reggae has long been the most vivid musical escape for me. Its soul-cleansing riddims always feel familiar and cozy, like rushing into your lover's arms after a significant time away. This is especially true for roots reggae, whose staccato guitar licks, billowing bass, and sonic splashes on a canvas of negative space, are like salve for the soul. The mid-tempo pulse varnishes heads with Kool-Aid grins and daydreams of living beachside amid nature's unrestricted beauty.\n\nGiven all that, you can understand why I've been obsessed with Chronixx lately. At a time when dancehall has been dominating the Jamaican soundscape, its refreshing to hear the man born Jamar McNaughton carrying the roots-revival torch for a younger generation and expanding upon the footprint left by his world-renowned predecessors.\n\nChronixx and his band Zincfence Redemption paid a long-awaited visit to the Tiny Desk to perform three songs from his sophomore album, Chronology.\n\n\nSet List:\n\n\"Skankin' Sweet\"\n\"Majesty\"\n\"Spanish Town Rocking\"\n\nMusicians:\n\nJamar McNaughton \"Chronixx\" (vocals); Evan Mason (keys); Stephen Coore (guitar); N'Namdi Robinson (guitar); Hector Lewis (percussion); Adrian Henry (bass); Oliver Thompson (drums)\n\nCredits:\n\nProducers: Abby O'Neill, Niki Walker, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Niki Walker, Tsering Bista, Morgan Noelle Smith, Bronson Arcuri; Production Assistant: Jenna Li; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFdebIZJah8", "date_published": "2017-10-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://isgp-studies.com", "title": "47 White Guilt Propaganda Tactics Used by Media and Political Elites to Push for Third World Immigration; motives", "description": "47 White Guilt Propaganda Tactics Used by Media and Political Elites to Push for Third World Immigration; motives", "link": "https://isgp-studies.com/immigration-white-guilt-warfare-manual", "date_published": "2017-09-29 12:11:46+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["hate speech", "the right wing", "immigration", "propaganda"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Bomba Estereo: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert", "description": "Sept. 22, 2017 | Felix Contreras -- If the Tiny Desk offers one lesson, it's that greatness doesn't diminish with less volume.

It's only cool for them,'\" Antonoff said. It was offered as an apology \u2014 he had just finished aiming a monologue about the link between dancing and crying at a single NPR staffer in the audience \u2014 but it was also a perfect encapsulation of the connection Antonoff's songs create. Bleachers makes truly conversational pop, songs that sound expansive but retain a sense of intimacy, even when aimed at the masses.\n\nAt the Tiny Desk, Antonoff, along with pianist Mikey Hart and multi-instrumentalist Evan Smith, pared away much of the pomp that can turn Antonoff's layered studio productions into neon-lit melodramas rollercoastering toward catharsis. On three songs from this year's album Gone Now impeccably re-arranged for a smaller space, it was impossible to miss the cracked longing at the heart of Antonoff's work.\n\n\"If you ever see Bleachers live, it's two drum sets and it's big and it's kinda like this big statement that I could hide behind the tears with this big rock show. But the songs are written like this,\" Antonoff said before launching into a version of the '80s-drenched single \"Don't Take The Money\" that was all feathery keyboards and spoken word verses \u2014 plus a brief quote from Queen's 1984 hit \"Radio Ga Ga. \"\n\nNot that he could resist a well-placed gimmick. \"Don't Take The Money\" was the only song of the day to include drum sounds, which came from a cassette tape in a boom box over which a microphone had been draped. He started the song by hitting play on the cassette, but it took three tries to nail the ending in time with Hart. For this group, seeing the flaws is part of the charm.\n\nSet List\n\n\"Everybody Lost Somebody\"\n\"Don't Take the Money\"\n\"Foreign Girls\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nJack Antonoff (vocals, keys); Evan Smith (vocals, keys, sax); Mikey Hart (vocals, piano)\n\nCREDITS\n\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Audio Engineers: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Colin Marshall, Tsering Bista; Production Assistant: Jenna Li; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCtkkX2f18M", "date_published": "2017-09-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "http://www.xinhuanet.com", "title": "Spotlight: How is AI disrupting financial industry - Xinhua | English.news.cn", "description": "Spotlight: How is AI disrupting financial industry - Xinhua | English.news.cn", "link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-09/18/c_136616606.htm", "date_published": "2017-09-18 22:20:54+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["blackrock", "fintech", "artificial intelligence"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC_SD8q_CLdAoeb1_uiJOvmA", "title": "Jordan Peterson: Why You Won't Have a Career", "description": "Jordan Peterson: Why You Won't Have a Career", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy4a8T45GiQ", "date_published": "2017-09-18 20:18:08+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-EN", "tags": ["feminism", "jordan peterson"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCerMB0mEB6rFywnPVLUWONA", "title": "Ridley Scott Tells the REAL REASON Why David Hates Humans and Engineers", "description": "Ridley Scott Tells the REAL REASON Why David Hates Humans and Engineers", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsEs1PwpU8Y", "date_published": "2017-09-09 20:24:09+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-EN", "tags": ["movies", "prometheus"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCnxGkOGNMqQEUMvroOWps6Q", "title": "Joe Rogan - James Damore on the Backlash from the Google Memo Controversy", "description": "Joe Rogan - James Damore on the Backlash from the Google Memo Controversy", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIW2OBOzu7Y", "date_published": "2017-09-06 12:36:58+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["google", "james damore", "joe rogan", "feminism"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCEl2GFl2bQUir39MeL8VbGQ", "title": "Dennis Meadows Interview p4/4 (A 'peaceful collapse' & many revolutions...)", "description": "Dennis Meadows Interview p4/4 (A 'peaceful collapse' & many revolutions...)", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbo6uvJBtZg", "date_published": "2017-09-04 13:52:39+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["population", "depopulation"]}, {"source": "www.independent.co.uk", "title": "Twitter's 'new' terms of service lead to panic among users of the site", "description": "", "link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/twitter-new-terms-of-service-truth-original-content-tweets-embed-messages-posts-a7929256.html", "date_published": "2017-09-04 12:04:50+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en", "tags": ["big tech", "social media", "subscription"]}, {"source": "https://www.catholicnewsagency.com", "title": "California bill seeks to punish 'misgendering' with jail time | Catholic News Agency", "description": "California bill seeks to punish 'misgendering' with jail time | Catholic News Agency", "link": "https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/36720/california-bill-seeks-to-punish-misgendering-with-jail-time", "date_published": "2017-09-02 11:07:46+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["the left wing", "pronouns", "newspeak"]}, {"source": "https://www.grunge.com", "title": "What Most People Don't Know About The Illuminati", "description": "What Most People Don't Know About The Illuminati", "link": "https://www.grunge.com/35035/secret-history-illuminati/", "date_published": "2017-08-28 13:30:16+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["illuminati", "secret societies"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "DJ Premier & The Badder Band: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert", "description": "Aug 21, 2017 | Abby O'Neill | Three-time Grammy winner DJ Premier, one of the definitive architects of New York hip-hop, brought a new type of life to NPR's Tiny Desk: our first concert helmed by a DJ.\n\nA packed house of head-nodding journalists grooved through their lunch hour to a nine-song medley of iconic Premier productions while decompressing from the unrelenting grind of the news cycle. The set list rested on the undeniable footprint of Preemo's classics, but this was more than just another DJ mix. His touring outfit, The Badder Band, overlaid Premier's blends with an undulating electric bass courtesy of Brady Watt, a steady accent on the one from drummer Lenny \"The Ox\" Reece and boisterous horns from Mark Williams and Jonathan Powell.\n\nBut it was Premier who remained front-and-center, commanding the crowd like a true party rocker. With throwbacks ranging from Gangstarr's \"Step into the Arena\" to an amped rendition of Jeru The Damaja's \"Da Bitches,\" embellished by The Badder's jazzy horns, Preemo concluded the set with a \"Moment of Truth,\" featuring the exalted rhymes of his posthumous Gangstarr partner, Guru.\n\nTiny Desk concerts are short by design, so naturally the format could barely scratch the surface of Premier's vault of street anthems, done for the likes of the Notorious B.I.G., JAY-Z, Nas, Kanye West, Big L, M.O.P., Mos Def, Group Home, Jeru the Damaja, AZ, Snoop Dogg, and many more. Even after a career spanning almost three decades, the man born Christopher Martin has managed to stay authentic to his analog grit and sample-chopping integrity, as if he were still an underdog.\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"Premier Production Medley\"\n\n- KRS-One - \"KRS-One Attacks\" \n- KRS-One - \"MC's Act Like They Don't Know\" \n- Das Efx - \"Real Hip-Hop\" \n- Nas - \"Nas Is Like\" \n- Jeru The Damaja - \"Da Bichez\"  \n- Gang Starr - \"Step In The Arena\" \n- Gang Starr feat.

What we're witnessing with Shelly Massenburg-Smith \u2014 a.k.a. D.R.A.M. \u2014 is the culmination of a story marked by resilience and stubborn strength.\n\nMaking a hit record in the music industry is extremely difficult, and in 2015, D.R.A.M.'s debut single \"Cha Cha\" was on the brink of exploding. It was getting played in clubs across the country and bubbling on the charts; the Beyhive even got a hold of it. Then Drake's \"Hotline Bling\" happened. The reports are conflicting as to the inspiration for the record, but there are glaring similarities in the sound of each. \"Hotline Bling\" was even originally billed as the \"Cha Cha\" remix by Beats 1, where the song made its debut. Needless to say, \"Hotline Bling\" practically swallowed \"Cha Cha,\" but D.R.A.M. didn't whine about it. He addressed it and went back to the drawing board, crafting another smash. \"Broccoli\" became one of 2016's biggest hits while setting up the release of his debut album, Big Baby D.R.A.M.\n\nWe recently invited D.R.A.M. to NPR to lend us his jovial spirit and brighten our workday; after all, his primary aim is to spread love through music. He was jarred by the Tiny Desk setting for a moment before the cameras started rolling. He's accustomed to touching every corner of the stage, but like a pro, he walked to the desk, activated his signature smile and bounced through various highlights from his catalog. D.R.A.M., whose name stands for Does Real Ass Music, wrote his first selection, \"Cash Machine,\" right after he'd received his first big music check.\n\nDon't you know that I got that bag\nAnd best believe my mama straight\nI sent some bands to Tatiana\nAnd if I brought you out I'll pay your way\n\nWhat twentysomething doesn't feel this way once they step into some money? The crowd beamed more with each performance, leading up to a climactic rendition of \"Broccoli.\" The energy is all fun and games, but his talent is no joke: \"Broccoli\" is nominated for a Grammy this year, right alongside \"Hotline Bling.\" A victory would provide a fitting end to this chapter of D.R.A.M.'s career, but regardless of the outcome, he's already victorious: Far removed from the \"Hotline Bling\" shadow, he's already creating bigger songs and more memorable moments, like this one at the Tiny Desk.\n\nBig Baby D.R.A.M. is available now:\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/big-baby-d.r.a.m./id1162247737\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Big-Baby-D-R-M-Explicit/dp/B01MEEVB2F\n\nSET LIST\n\"Cash Machine\"\n\"Cute\"\n\"Sweet VA Breeze\"\n\"Special\"\n\"Broccoli\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nD.R.A.M.
