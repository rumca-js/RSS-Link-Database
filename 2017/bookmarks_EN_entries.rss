Berserkers (or berserks / Berserkir ) were Norse warriors who are primarily reported in Icelandic literature to have fought in a trance-like fury.
These champions would often go into battle without mail-coats. Berserkers are attested to in numerous Old Norse sources.

<item><title>![CDATA[Chronixx: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert]]</title><description>![CDATA[Sept. 27, 2017 | Abby O'Neill -- Reggae has long been the most vivid musical escape for me. Its soul-cleansing riddims always feel familiar and cozy, like rushing into your lover's arms after a significant time away. This is especially true for roots reggae, whose staccato guitar licks, billowing bass, and sonic splashes on a canvas of negative space, are like salve for the soul. The mid-tempo pulse varnishes heads with Kool-Aid grins and daydreams of living beachside amid nature's unrestricted beauty.

Given all that, you can understand why I've been obsessed with Chronixx lately. At a time when dancehall has been dominating the Jamaican soundscape, its refreshing to hear the man born Jamar McNaughton carrying the roots-revival torch for a younger generation and expanding upon the footprint left by his world-renowned predecessors.

Chronixx and his band Zincfence Redemption paid a long-awaited visit to the Tiny Desk to perform three songs from his sophomore album, Chronology.


Set List:

"Skankin' Sweet"
"Majesty"
"Spanish Town Rocking"

Musicians:

Jamar McNaughton "Chronixx" (vocals); Evan Mason (keys); Stephen Coore (guitar); N'Namdi Robinson (guitar); Hector Lewis (percussion); Adrian Henry (bass); Oliver Thompson (drums)

<item><title>![CDATA[Bomba Estereo: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert]]</title><description>![CDATA[Sept. 22, 2017 | Felix Contreras -- If the Tiny Desk offers one lesson, it's that greatness doesn't diminish with less volume. The lesson doubly applies here.

During their performance, Bomba Estereo's Simon Mejia (bass and keyboards) observed that it was the quietist the band has ever played; they rose to the occasion with an intense performance that reflects their earliest days working smaller venues in Colombia.

Band leaders Mejia and Li Saumet (lead vocals) have been consistent in their devotion and homage to Afro-Colombian music throughout their five albums, and steadfast in their fantastic mash-up of electronic music, creating a sonic signature that has become popular around the globe.

But you won't hear that on this video.

What you'll hear is the power of their songwriting and arranging with this stripped-down presentation— which helps remind us of why we fell for this band in the first place.


Set List

- "Soy Yo"
- "Somos Dos"

MUSICIANS

Liliana Saumet (vocals), Simon Mejia (bass/keys), Andres Zea (drums), Efrain Cuadrado (percussion), Jose Castillo (guitar)

<item><title>![CDATA[Bleachers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert]]</title><description>![CDATA[Sept. 12, 2017 | Jacob Ganz -- Two songs into his Tiny Desk concert, Jack Antonoff revealed a bit of stagecraft behind his performances with Bleachers.

"My manager says, 'When you play for 1,000 people, don't talk to one person. It's only cool for them,'" Antonoff said. It was offered as an apology — he had just finished aiming a monologue about the link between dancing and crying at a single NPR staffer in the audience — but it was also a perfect encapsulation of the connection Antonoff's songs create. Bleachers makes truly conversational pop, songs that sound expansive but retain a sense of intimacy, even when aimed at the masses.

At the Tiny Desk, Antonoff, along with pianist Mikey Hart and multi-instrumentalist Evan Smith, pared away much of the pomp that can turn Antonoff's layered studio productions into neon-lit melodramas rollercoastering toward catharsis. On three songs from this year's album Gone Now impeccably re-arranged for a smaller space, it was impossible to miss the cracked longing at the heart of Antonoff's work.

"If you ever see Bleachers live, it's two drum sets and it's big and it's kinda like this big statement that I could hide behind the tears with this big rock show. But the songs are written like this," Antonoff said before launching into a version of the '80s-drenched single "Don't Take The Money" that was all feathery keyboards and spoken word verses — plus a brief quote from Queen's 1984 hit "Radio Ga Ga. "

Not that he could resist a well-placed gimmick. "Don't Take The Money" was the only song of the day to include drum sounds, which came from a cassette tape in a boom box over which a microphone had been draped. He started the song by hitting play on the cassette, but it took three tries to nail the ending in time with Hart. For this group, seeing the flaws is part of the charm.

Set List

"Everybody Lost Somebody"
"Don't Take the Money"
"Foreign Girls"

MUSICIANS

Jack Antonoff (vocals, keys); Evan Smith (vocals, keys, sax); Mikey Hart (vocals, piano)

<item><title>![CDATA[DJ Premier & The Badder Band: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert]]</title><description>![CDATA[Aug 21, 2017 | Abby O'Neill | Three-time Grammy winner DJ Premier, one of the definitive architects of New York hip-hop, brought a new type of life to NPR's Tiny Desk: our first concert helmed by a DJ.

A packed house of head-nodding journalists grooved through their lunch hour to a nine-song medley of iconic Premier productions while decompressing from the unrelenting grind of the news cycle. The set list rested on the undeniable footprint of Preemo's classics, but this was more than just another DJ mix. His touring outfit, The Badder Band, overlaid Premier's blends with an undulating electric bass courtesy of Brady Watt, a steady accent on the one from drummer Lenny "The Ox" Reece and boisterous horns from Mark Williams and Jonathan Powell.

But it was Premier who remained front-and-center, commanding the crowd like a true party rocker. With throwbacks ranging from Gangstarr's "Step into the Arena" to an amped rendition of Jeru The Damaja's "Da Bitches," embellished by The Badder's jazzy horns, Preemo concluded the set with a "Moment of Truth," featuring the exalted rhymes of his posthumous Gangstarr partner, Guru.

Tiny Desk concerts are short by design, so naturally the format could barely scratch the surface of Premier's vault of street anthems, done for the likes of the Notorious B.I.G., JAY-Z, Nas, Kanye West, Big L, M.O.P., Mos Def, Group Home, Jeru the Damaja, AZ, Snoop Dogg, and many more. Even after a career spanning almost three decades, the man born Christopher Martin has managed to stay authentic to his analog grit and sample-chopping integrity, as if he were still an underdog.

<item><title>![CDATA[Dirty Dozen Brass Band: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert]]</title><description>![CDATA[Bob Boilen | February 28, 2017 — They're simply an abundance of euphoria. The Dirty Dozen Brass Band blasted the Tiny Desk with a Sousaphone, trumpets, saxophones, guitar and drums, at stunning volume, for a joyful celebration.

This band has been mixing be-bop and funk for 40 years. Around this time of year, when Mardi Gras revelry is fueled by New Orleans jazz, it was so good to feel their sounds in the office. Since today is Fat Tuesday — just before Lent and its fasts begin for some — we are sharing the party we hosted, filled with brass and sass from this fixture of great American music. Enjoy.

<item><title>![CDATA[D.R.A.M.: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert]]</title><description>![CDATA[Bobby Carter | February 1, 2017 — We all love a good redemption story: We're front and center to watch our heroes get knocked down, and then we cheer for them to triumphantly rebound. What we're witnessing with Shelly Massenburg-Smith — a.k.a. D.R.A.M. — is the culmination of a story marked by resilience and stubborn strength.

Making a hit record in the music industry is extremely difficult, and in 2015, D.R.A.M.'s debut single "Cha Cha" was on the brink of exploding. It was getting played in clubs across the country and bubbling on the charts; the Beyhive even got a hold of it. Then Drake's "Hotline Bling" happened. The reports are conflicting as to the inspiration for the record, but there are glaring similarities in the sound of each. "Hotline Bling" was even originally billed as the "Cha Cha" remix by Beats 1, where the song made its debut. Needless to say, "Hotline Bling" practically swallowed "Cha Cha," but D.R.A.M. didn't whine about it. He addressed it and went back to the drawing board, crafting another smash. "Broccoli" became one of 2016's biggest hits while setting up the release of his debut album, Big Baby D.R.A.M.

We recently invited D.R.A.M. to NPR to lend us his jovial spirit and brighten our workday; after all, his primary aim is to spread love through music. He was jarred by the Tiny Desk setting for a moment before the cameras started rolling. He's accustomed to touching every corner of the stage, but like a pro, he walked to the desk, activated his signature smile and bounced through various highlights from his catalog. D.R.A.M., whose name stands for Does Real Ass Music, wrote his first selection, "Cash Machine," right after he'd received his first big music check.

Don't you know that I got that bag
And best believe my mama straight
I sent some bands to Tatiana
And if I brought you out I'll pay your way

What twentysomething doesn't feel this way once they step into some money? The crowd beamed more with each performance, leading up to a climactic rendition of "Broccoli." The energy is all fun and games, but his talent is no joke: "Broccoli" is nominated for a Grammy this year, right alongside "Hotline Bling." A victory would provide a fitting end to this chapter of D.R.A.M.'s career, but regardless of the outcome, he's already victorious: Far removed from the "Hotline Bling" shadow, he's already creating bigger songs and more memorable moments, like this one at the Tiny Desk.

This is the official music video of Bad Karma.

The language is Punjabi, the language of a culture located inside the borders of India and Pakistan.
The words go: “O Na Kar Maan Rupaiye Waala Ban Ban Ke Na Bage”, which roughly translate to:
”Don’t keep on wanting money, people have loads and they’re never happy”

The vocals are taken from a sample pack called “Deepest India” by a company called Zero-G. They field recorded it in 1996-7 in India. The vocalists are Bibi Swarn Nooran, Master Dilbahar and Sohan Lal]]</description><pubDate>2017-01-13 00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sNWKbnaFkg</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sNWKbnaFkg</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Heilung Krigsgaldr [Official Video]]]</title><description>![CDATA[Heilung is amplified history from early medieval northern Europe and should not be mistaken for a modern political or religious statement of any kind.

Remember that we all are brothers
All people, beasts, tree and stone and wind
We all descend from the one great being
That was always there
Before people lived and named it
Before the first seed sprouted
