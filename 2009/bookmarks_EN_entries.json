We like to do music and videos and build stuff, sometimes\nwith artistic ambitions sometimes just to save money like film equipment and stuff like that. We have also been working for three years on a digital puzzle called \"Crypzzle\" that you can download for free from our webpage: www.rymdreglage.se It contains over 5000 hours ambient music. 1024 albums with 99 songs on each album. The winner will hopefully be happy. More info on the webpage. You can find all of our music on Spotify and probably most of the other streaming platforms. \n\nIf you like what we are doing and want to support us financially, you can do so on our website www.rymdreglage.se We use PayPal, swish and Patreon. If you donate 200 USD or swishar 2000 SEK or more we will send you a pair of the \"Steampunk Rave Glasses\" that are handmade by us, see the following link: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5G9n_JmdbE&t=48s\nThey comes wrapped in a paper from the video Terminator 2 - 20 years that we made back in 2011. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4mWyeVitNQ\n\nIf you donate 70-199 USD or swishar 700-1999 SEK we will send you a digital puzzle called: Crypzzle. It is on a 256 GB USB-stick and contains over 100 000 ambient songs. More information here: http://www.rymdreglage.se/crypzzle/\n\nIf you donate 30-69 USD or swishar 300 - 699 SEK we will send you All songs we have made so far on some DVD's plus exclusive photos of the members in Rymdreglage posing in the excellent nature of Sweden. This are also wrapped in a paper from the video Terminator 2 - 20 years. \n\nIf you donate 20-29 USD's or swishar 200-299 SEK we will send you a copy of Legenden om Dunneric (Legend of Dunneric) to you. (DVD with real DVD-case and everything like the one in the store, almost). The language is in swedish and there are only swedish subtitles, but that does not matter because the dialoge is just silly and it is the extrodernary action scenes that brings the story forward. This one is not wrapped in a paper from the video Terminator 2 - 20 years because then it will be to heavy. Here is a link to a music video with clips from the video \"Legenden om Dunneric\":\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6Sxx0TOZJ4\n\nWe also have Patreon where we mostly upload vlogs of our work with videos, music and some random stuff, right now we have started to build the Piano thrower that hopefully will be able to throw a piano 100 meters. We have 72 pianos that we will smash and film with a high speed camera and make a music video of.
