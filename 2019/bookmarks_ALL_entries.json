But are they fun time-savers or the beginning of an Orwellian nightmare</p><p>One day in 2017, Alexa went rogue. When Martin Josephson, who lives in London, came home from work, he heard his Amazon Echo Dot voice assistant spitting out fragmentary commands, seemingly based on his previous interactions with the device. It appeared to be regurgitating requests to book train tickets for journeys he had already taken and to record TV shows that he had already watched. Josephson had not said the wake word \u2013 \u201cAlexa\u201d \u2013 to activate it and nothing he said would stop it. It was, he says, \u201cKafkaesque\u201d.</p><p>This was especially interesting because Josephson (not his real name) was a former Amazon employee. Three years earlier, he had volunteered to sit in a room reciting a string of apparently meaningless phrases into a microphone for an undisclosed purpose. Only when Amazon released the Echo in the US in 2014 did he realise what he had been working on. He bought a Dot, the Echo\u2019s cheaper, smaller model, after it launched in 2016, and found it useful enough until the day it went haywire. When the Dot\u2019s outburst subsided, he unplugged it and deposited it in the bin. \u201cI felt a bit foolish,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving worked at Amazon, and having seen how they used people\u2019s data, I knew I couldn\u2019t trust them.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": true, "language": "en-UK", "user": "rumpel", "tags": ["orwell", "privacy", "smartdevice", "iot", "surveillance"]}, {"source": "https://www.buzzfeednews.com", "link": "https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/unsworth-reply-elon-musk-fucking-idiot", "title": "The Cave Rescuer Suing Elon Musk Claims The Tesla CEO Fabricated Pedophilia Claims Against Him", "date_published": "2019-10-08 12:21:11+00:00", "description": "The Cave Rescuer Suing Elon Musk Claims The Tesla CEO Fabricated Pedophilia Claims Against Him", "persistent": true, "language": "en-US", "user": null, "tags": ["billionaires", "musk", "lie", "elites"]}, {"source": "https://www.vox.com", "link": "https://www.vox.com/2019/10/8/20904433/blizzard-hong-kong-hearthstone-blitzchung", "title": "One of America\u2019s biggest gaming companies is acting as China\u2019s censor", "date_published": "2019-10-08 12:08:47+00:00", "description": "One of America\u2019s biggest gaming companies is acting as China\u2019s censor", "persistent": true, "language": "en-US", "user": null, "tags": ["china", "blizzard", "censorship"]}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/05/facial-recognition-technology-hurtling-towards-surveillance-state", "title": "'We are hurtling towards a surveillance state\u2019: the rise of facial recognition technology", "date_published": "2019-10-05 09:00:43+00:00", "description": "<p>It can pick out shoplifters, international criminals and lost children in seconds.

A steep staircase plunges visitors into a dimly lit cavern, lined with dusty champagne bottles and faded newspaper clippings, which appears to have had only minor refurbishment since it opened in 1890. \u201cIf Miss Havisham was in the licensing trade,\u201d an Evening Standard review once suggested, \u201cthis could have been the result.\u201d</p><p>The bar\u2019s Dickensian gloom is a selling point for people embarking on affairs, and actors or politicians wanting a quiet drink \u2013 but also for pickpockets.

When two of Gordon\u2019s friends visited the bar for lunch and both had their wallets pinched in his presence, he decided to take matters into his own hands. \u201cThe police did nothing about it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt really annoyed me.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/05/facial-recognition-technology-hurtling-towards-surveillance-state\">Continue reading...</a>", "persistent": true, "language": "en-UK", "user": "rumpel", "tags": ["biometric", "facial recognition", "india", "surveillance", "bigbrother", "corporatocracy"]}, {"source": "https://lawliberty.org", "link": "https://lawliberty.org/eyes-wide-shut-and-the-moral-bankruptcy-of-the-american-elite/", "title": "Eyes Wide Shut and the Moral Bankruptcy of the American Elite", "date_published": "2019-10-04 20:29:42+00:00", "description": "Eyes Wide Shut and the Moral Bankruptcy of the American Elite", "persistent": true, "language": "en-US", "user": "rumpel", "tags": ["bilionaires", "epstein", "eyes wide shut"]}, {"source": "http://www.silaojca.pl", "link": "http://www.silaojca.pl/w-jakim-stopniu-brak-ojca-wplywa-na-zycie-dziecka/", "title": "W jakim stopniu brak ojca wp\u0142ywa na \u017cycie dziecka?", "date_published": "2019-10-02 08:36:52+00:00", "description": "W jakim stopniu brak ojca wp\u0142ywa na \u017cycie dziecka?", "persistent": true, "language": "pl-PL", "user": "rumpel", "tags": ["family", "fatherlessness"]}, {"source": "https://www.irishcentral.com", "link": "https://www.irishcentral.com/news/bishop-mccarrick-crimes", "title": "Who is Bishop McCarrick and what are his crimes?", "date_published": "2019-09-30 15:33:50+00:00", "description": "Who is Bishop McCarrick and what are his crimes?", "persistent": true, "language": "en", "user": "rumpel", "tags": ["church scandal"]}, {"source": "https://www.weforum.org", "link": "https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/09/gamification-revolutionise-creative-thinking", "title": "Playing more video games could increase creative thinking at work", "date_published": "2019-09-30 09:12:44+00:00", "description": "Playing more video games could increase creative thinking at work", "persistent": true, "language": "en", "user": "rumpel", "tags": ["programming", "work", "games"]}, {"source": "https://greenjihad.com", "link": "https://greenjihad.com/2019/09/29/the-green-swindlers-behind-greta-thunberg/", "title": "The Green Swindlers Behind Greta Thunberg", "date_published": "2019-09-29 20:06:07+00:00", "description": "The Green Swindlers Behind Greta Thunberg", "persistent": true, "language": "en", "user": "rumpel", "tags": ["greta", "corporatocracy", "thunberg", "climate change"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/@topowadycha", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7_IX9NtjnI", "title": "Efekt Snowdena - czy nasza prywatno\u015b\u0107 w Internecie JEST BEZPIECZNA?
