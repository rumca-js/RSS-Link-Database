The internet forums, the old youtube, message boards, meme sites, and overall a much more expressive era. Perhaps there are lessons to be learned from that time period, from the golden age of the internet. \n\nSpeaking of social media, I try to keep mine as non-toxic and positive as possible.

But are they fun time-savers or the beginning of an Orwellian nightmare</p><p>One day in 2017, Alexa went rogue. When Martin Josephson, who lives in London, came home from work, he heard his Amazon Echo Dot voice assistant spitting out fragmentary commands, seemingly based on his previous interactions with the device. It appeared to be regurgitating requests to book train tickets for journeys he had already taken and to record TV shows that he had already watched. Josephson had not said the wake word \u2013 \u201cAlexa\u201d \u2013 to activate it and nothing he said would stop it. It was, he says, \u201cKafkaesque\u201d.</p><p>This was especially interesting because Josephson (not his real name) was a former Amazon employee. Three years earlier, he had volunteered to sit in a room reciting a string of apparently meaningless phrases into a microphone for an undisclosed purpose.

first version omits the extended credit sequence at the game's start, instead replacing it with a screen and scroll text for the backstory.\n\nThe second version - the one I used to own - seems to be older, with the game credited to Team 7 and 17 bit Software (the studio's name before they became Team 17).

The congress promotes conservative Christian family values. This event was enormously controversial in Italy and attracted 20,000 protesters to the city, the protesters said the congress was homophobic and wanted to restrict women's freedom, keep them at home doing the ironing, take Italy back to the middle ages. Notes / explanations:\n\n00:10 The host is Eva Crosetta who presents a religious affairs programme on Italian state broadcaster RAI.\n\n05:08 Infant's income = 400 euros a month, per child, up to the age of six, a Fratelli d'Italia policy.\n\n05:10 Citizen's income = a form of social welfare introduced for people living below the poverty line (earning less than 780 euros a month). One of Five Star's flagship policies.\n\n05:22 Nursery schools in Italy (asili nido) are for kids aged 1-3.\n\n05:34 Law 194 = 1978 law that legalised abortion in Italy. Meloni is saying that parts of the law can be applied to provide assistance for mothers who choose not to have an abortion.\n\n06:45 Comuni = small municipalities. Meloni is talking about the growth of towns in medieval Italy. This was important in terms of commerce, culture, development of legal rights and government. Italy was the most highly urbanised part of the world at the time.\n\n06:53 Matera = Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio (who opposed the congress) was caught on camera asking the governor of Puglia what he was doing regarding the town of Matera (which is not in Puglia, it is Basilicata).Di Maio later responded to the media saying he knew Matera wasn't in Puglia but that Puglia was in fact receiving funds related to Matera (Matera is one of the European Capitals of Culture) including for a railway, and that is what he was asking about.\n\n08:46 Single thinking = ideological dogmatism on a particular subject, ideological orthodoxy, refusal to accept alternative ideas on what the solution to a problem is.\n\n09:34 This is a well known case in Italy. The parents in question were actually 57 and 69 when their daughter was born.\n\n10:12 Eluana Englaro's father fought for years to be able to switch off her life support, before finally being permitted to do so.\n\n10:27 Charlie Gard and Alfie Evans were infants whose life support was switched off against the wishes of their parents.\n\n12:53 \"We will defend God, country and family.\" Meloni was criticised for this quote, people saying it was from Mussolini. It was actually originally made by Giuseppe Mazzini, a major figure in Italy's Risorgimento (19th century unification).\n\n13:14 GK Chesterton, British conservative writer. Salvini, who also spoke at this conference, about 20 minutes after Meloni, also used this quote at the end of his speech. The crowd started laughing and Salvini realised someone has said it already. He took in good spirit. \"Who said it? As a gentleman I take a step back.
