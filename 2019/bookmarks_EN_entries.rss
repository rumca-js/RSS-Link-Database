THE TURNING POINT Song Lyrics

My heart is free
My heart is free
No place where I would rather be

My heart is free
My heart is free
Until you come to rescue me

You find me here
You find me here
You dry my eyes and shed a tear
You turn me bad
You turn me good
Forget to hope and learn to fear

CHORUS

Tell me that its good
If we do something
Believe in something
I don't think I should
If it aint nothing
If it aint nothing good

My heart is free
My heart is free
No place where I would rather be 
You find me here
You find me here
You dry my eyes and shed a tear

<item><title>![CDATA[The Golden Age of the Internet Is Over]]</title><description>![CDATA[The modern day internet and the direction it's going with social media and online communication may be viewed as...dystopian for some, and with good reason. But things weren't always this way, in fact, there was once a time where things were far more hopeful than they are today. The internet forums, the old youtube, message boards, meme sites, and overall a much more expressive era. Perhaps there are lessons to be learned from that time period, from the golden age of the internet. 

Speaking of social media, I try to keep mine as non-toxic and positive as possible. Below are some links to sites where I occasionally post extra content and share things publicly. Also, I've brought back my patreon but it will be on a per-video basis instead of monthly. Appreciate all the support and feedback as always.

His thumbprint, needed to prove his identity, wasn’t registering on the new system.</p><p>He was told to do an online update. But to do so he would need to get to a private centre – a four-mile journey from his village in Dumka, in the state of Jharkhand, north-east India. This would mean missing at least a day’s potential work, which he desperately needed to buy food. And even if he made the trek, there was no guarantee that the system, which often suffers from network outages, would be working properly.

<item><title>![CDATA['Alexa, are you invading my privacy?' – the dark side of our voice assistants]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>There are more than 100m Alexa-enabled devices in our homes. But are they fun time-savers or the beginning of an Orwellian nightmare</p><p>One day in 2017, Alexa went rogue. When Martin Josephson, who lives in London, came home from work, he heard his Amazon Echo Dot voice assistant spitting out fragmentary commands, seemingly based on his previous interactions with the device. It appeared to be regurgitating requests to book train tickets for journeys he had already taken and to record TV shows that he had already watched. Josephson had not said the wake word – “Alexa” – to activate it and nothing he said would stop it. It was, he says, “Kafkaesque”.</p><p>This was especially interesting because Josephson (not his real name) was a former Amazon employee. Three years earlier, he had volunteered to sit in a room reciting a string of apparently meaningless phrases into a microphone for an undisclosed purpose. Only when Amazon released the Echo in the US in 2014 did he realise what he had been working on. He bought a Dot, the Echo’s cheaper, smaller model, after it launched in 2016, and found it useful enough until the day it went haywire. When the Dot’s outburst subsided, he unplugged it and deposited it in the bin. “I felt a bit foolish,” he says. “Having worked at Amazon, and having seen how they used people’s data, I knew I couldn’t trust them.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants">Continue reading...</a>]]</description><pubDate>2019-10-09 05:00:41+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants</guid>

But as the cameras proliferate, who’s watching the watchers?</p><p><a href="https://gordonswinebar.com/" title="">Gordon’s</a><a href="https://gordonswinebar.com/" title=""> wine bar</a> is reached through a discreet side-door, a few paces from the slipstream of London theatregoers and suited professionals powering towards their evening train. A steep staircase plunges visitors into a dimly lit cavern, lined with dusty champagne bottles and faded newspaper clippings, which appears to have had only minor refurbishment since it opened in 1890. “If Miss Havisham was in the licensing trade,” an Evening Standard review once suggested, “this could have been the result.”</p><p>The bar’s Dickensian gloom is a selling point for people embarking on affairs, and actors or politicians wanting a quiet drink – but also for pickpockets. When Simon Gordon took over the family business in the early 2000s, he would spend hours scrutinising the faces of the people who haunted his CCTV footage. “There was one guy who I almost felt I knew,” he says. “He used to come down here the whole time and steal.” The man vanished for a six-month stretch, but then reappeared, chubbier, apparently after a stint in jail. When two of Gordon’s friends visited the bar for lunch and both had their wallets pinched in his presence, he decided to take matters into his own hands. “The police did nothing about it,” he says. “It really annoyed me.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/05/facial-recognition-technology-hurtling-towards-surveillance-state">Continue reading...</a>]]</description><pubDate>2019-10-05 09:00:43+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/05/facial-recognition-technology-hurtling-towards-surveillance-state</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/05/facial-recognition-technology-hurtling-towards-surveillance-state</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Manufactured Discontent and Fortnite]]</title><description>![CDATA[Clickbait Title: Dab your hearts out and jump on the battle bus, I'm dropping in to Retail Row and I've got an orange pump pointed right at your default.

If you want to know one thing about making a machinima in Fortnite it's that it's super, super rad when you spend several hours late at night setting up footage in your virtual digital studio with the intent that you'll record the properly-composed shots in replay mode in the morning, only to wake up to a minor patch that breaks all your replays. It's extra rad when this happens three days in a row.

Neyman and Pearson developed a technique for statistical quality control in factories. Yet somehow, these two techniques were confused and merged into the Null Ritual of today, which is the neurotic pattern that every paper in many disciplines have to follow.</p><p>The Null Ritual is one of the clearest examples of academic consensus so far off the tracks that scholar treat the techniques in textbooks were religious devotion, rather than with critical awareness of what they are actually supposed to be. The end result?
