THE TURNING POINT Song Lyrics

My heart is free
My heart is free
No place where I would rather be

My heart is free
My heart is free
Until you come to rescue me

You find me here
You find me here
You dry my eyes and shed a tear
You turn me bad
You turn me good
Forget to hope and learn to fear

CHORUS

Tell me that its good
If we do something
Believe in something
I don't think I should
If it aint nothing
If it aint nothing good

My heart is free
My heart is free
No place where I would rather be 
You find me here
You find me here
You dry my eyes and shed a tear

"MY STICK!" merch: https://bit.ly/3hoEhzF Follow on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook! 
LYRICS (below): 
Knock you in your head with my stick 
With my stick
You gon' have a mark from my stick
From my stick
My stick, my stick
My stick is better than bacon
Mmm-ah-ha-ha-hmmm
You can't touch my stick (I don't wanna)
Mmm-ah-ha-ha-phfrr
Yeah, you want my stick
Thunk your coconut with my stick
Look at my stick
You gon' feel the wrath of my stick
Fear my stick!
My stick, my stick
My stick is better than bacon
Mmm-ah-ha-ha-hmmm
You can't touch my stick 
But it's just a stick!
Mmm-ah-ha-ha-hmmm
It's my perfect stick
My stick is my friend born from a log
Everyone can see it's better than bacon
Why'd you get so crotchety and mean?
Look at my stick
Why'd you drink that creature's milk, it's green?
Got me sick!
My stick, my stick
My stick is better than bacon
Mmm-ah-ha-ha-hmmm
You can't use my stick 
But it's just a stick!
Mmm-ah-ha-ha-hmmm
Don't you love my stick?
No, it's just a stick!
Mmm-ah-ha-ha-bphfmm
It's my perfect stick
My stick and me take walks every day
Past the hooligans down by the ocean
When they laugh at my stick then they learn
How my stick is much denser than bacon
Bought a little piggy and I let the little piggy run amok (so cute)
But when I would sleep little piggy kept waking me up (sold him)
People often fight about which birds are the best birds (do they?)
But everybody can agree that seagulls are the worst
I kiss my stick, it's my stick 
You can't pick up my stick 
Keep your mitts of my stick
I disappear for years then reappear
Right here to cheer about my cool stick
When I was a little bitty kid
Little bitty kid
I had not yet found my mighty stick
Then I did! Mm-hmmm
I could break your stick using just my brain
My stick?!
I could make you wish you couldn't feel pain
Not my stick!
My stick, my stick
My stick is better than bacon
Mmm-ah-ha-ha-hmmm
You can't touch my stick 
I don't want your stick!
Mmm-ah-ha-ha-vmmp
Yeah you want my stick
I mean, it's just a stick!
Mmm-ah-ha-ha-bphfmm
It's my big boy stick
Bought a bag of venom and I wish I really, really, really didn't (it turns out)
Nobody has a good reason to own a bag of venom (it's poison)
Poke on my bruise sometimes 'cause I like how it hurts (it hurts good)
Everybody can agree that seagulls are the worst
I kiss my stick, it's my stick 
You can't pickup my stick 
Keep your mitts off my stick
Everyone can see it's better than bacon
My stick is my friend born from a log
Everyone can see it's better than bacon

Nov. 18, 2019 | Bobby Carter -- While preparing for Burna Boy's Tiny Desk appearance, it was evident early on that his performance would be strictly business. After exchanging pleasantries on the phone with his mother and manager, Bose Ogulu, she made it clear there wouldn't be time for much of anything else. "Burna has been working really hard so please bear with us," she told me. "The band will arrive well before him. Let me know the latest time at which he can arrive."

The Nigerian singer and songwriter is one of the biggest African artists in the world. He's also a pioneer of Afro-fusion which incorporates sonics and influences from a myriad of genres, laid on an Afrobeat foundation. The sound has been inescapable this year. The man born Damini Ogulu has been touring the world for the majority of 2019 and has at least 10 songs in the current nightclub rotation. Beyoncé took notice and offered him a place on The Lion King soundtrack, The Lion King: The Gift.

Sandwiched between two sold-out concerts in Washington D.C., his Tiny Desk performance offers something relatively different from what we're used to seeing at his rowdy stage shows. He's more reflective here and restrained, allowing his songwriting to shine. In the spirit of one of his heroes, Fela Kuti, he weaves through highlights from his breakout album, African Giant, that are liable to move your body as much as your social consciousness.

"Gbona"
"Wetin Man Go Do"

<item><title>![CDATA[The Golden Age of the Internet Is Over]]</title><description>![CDATA[The modern day internet and the direction it's going with social media and online communication may be viewed as...dystopian for some, and with good reason. But things weren't always this way, in fact, there was once a time where things were far more hopeful than they are today. The internet forums, the old youtube, message boards, meme sites, and overall a much more expressive era. Perhaps there are lessons to be learned from that time period, from the golden age of the internet. 

Speaking of social media, I try to keep mine as non-toxic and positive as possible. Below are some links to sites where I occasionally post extra content and share things publicly. Also, I've brought back my patreon but it will be on a per-video basis instead of monthly. Appreciate all the support and feedback as always.

This game is a buried treasure and a staple of my childhood. As a kid you're sucked through the cosmos into an evil theme park from which there is no escape. The performances, miniature sets and sound design is absolutely fantastic. You get lost in a deadly and immersive world that genuinely terrified me as a child. The fact so much love and attention to detail has been crushed to fit on a 1996 CD-ROM is a tragedy.

I think Escape From Horrorland deserves a 4K remaster, a VR experience, and a book of HorrorLand artwork and production stills. It may be a legal nightmare but it’s a Kickstarter campaign I would contribute handsomely to.

His thumbprint, needed to prove his identity, wasn’t registering on the new system.</p><p>He was told to do an online update. But to do so he would need to get to a private centre – a four-mile journey from his village in Dumka, in the state of Jharkhand, north-east India. This would mean missing at least a day’s potential work, which he desperately needed to buy food. And even if he made the trek, there was no guarantee that the system, which often suffers from network outages, would be working properly.

<item><title>![CDATA['Alexa, are you invading my privacy?' – the dark side of our voice assistants]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>There are more than 100m Alexa-enabled devices in our homes. But are they fun time-savers or the beginning of an Orwellian nightmare</p><p>One day in 2017, Alexa went rogue. When Martin Josephson, who lives in London, came home from work, he heard his Amazon Echo Dot voice assistant spitting out fragmentary commands, seemingly based on his previous interactions with the device. It appeared to be regurgitating requests to book train tickets for journeys he had already taken and to record TV shows that he had already watched. Josephson had not said the wake word – “Alexa” – to activate it and nothing he said would stop it. It was, he says, “Kafkaesque”.</p><p>This was especially interesting because Josephson (not his real name) was a former Amazon employee. Three years earlier, he had volunteered to sit in a room reciting a string of apparently meaningless phrases into a microphone for an undisclosed purpose. Only when Amazon released the Echo in the US in 2014 did he realise what he had been working on. He bought a Dot, the Echo’s cheaper, smaller model, after it launched in 2016, and found it useful enough until the day it went haywire. When the Dot’s outburst subsided, he unplugged it and deposited it in the bin. “I felt a bit foolish,” he says. “Having worked at Amazon, and having seen how they used people’s data, I knew I couldn’t trust them.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants">Continue reading...</a>]]</description><pubDate>2019-10-09 05:00:41+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA['We are hurtling towards a surveillance state’: the rise of facial recognition technology]]</title><description>![CDATA[<p>It can pick out shoplifters, international criminals and lost children in seconds. But as the cameras proliferate, who’s watching the watchers?</p><p><a href="https://gordonswinebar.com/" title="">Gordon’s</a><a href="https://gordonswinebar.com/" title=""> wine bar</a> is reached through a discreet side-door, a few paces from the slipstream of London theatregoers and suited professionals powering towards their evening train. A steep staircase plunges visitors into a dimly lit cavern, lined with dusty champagne bottles and faded newspaper clippings, which appears to have had only minor refurbishment since it opened in 1890. “If Miss Havisham was in the licensing trade,” an Evening Standard review once suggested, “this could have been the result.”</p><p>The bar’s Dickensian gloom is a selling point for people embarking on affairs, and actors or politicians wanting a quiet drink – but also for pickpockets. When Simon Gordon took over the family business in the early 2000s, he would spend hours scrutinising the faces of the people who haunted his CCTV footage. “There was one guy who I almost felt I knew,” he says. “He used to come down here the whole time and steal.” The man vanished for a six-month stretch, but then reappeared, chubbier, apparently after a stint in jail. When two of Gordon’s friends visited the bar for lunch and both had their wallets pinched in his presence, he decided to take matters into his own hands. “The police did nothing about it,” he says. “It really annoyed me.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/05/facial-recognition-technology-hurtling-towards-surveillance-state">Continue reading...</a>]]</description><pubDate>2019-10-05 09:00:43+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/05/facial-recognition-technology-hurtling-towards-surveillance-state</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/05/facial-recognition-technology-hurtling-towards-surveillance-state</guid>

Aug. 9, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- When Among Authors arrived at NPR, the Seattle band seemed like a pack of eager pups — and with good reason. The odds of this unsigned, self-managed quartet playing a Tiny Desk concert was pretty small, but Among Authors is a band that beats the odds. Nearly a dozen years ago, at 23, bandleader Ian Ketterer had open-heart surgery. Born without a thumb on his right hand and deaf in his right ear, he plays piano and sings. And, out of more than 6,000 entries to our 2018 Tiny Desk Contest, Among Authors was one of the most original bands I'd seen — so much so that we invited the group to perform as part of our Tiny Desk Contest tour in Seattle. I was even more impressed by Among Authors' songwriting and keen, spare musicianship at that KEXP-sponsored event, so I invited them to play a Tiny Desk concert. By the time their big day came, nearly a year later, they were ready — nervous, but ready.

Ian Ketterer sat behind our upright piano, partially hidden by his hair and hoodie. Patrick Brockwell's clean look provided a stark contrast, and his no-frills, perfectly placed rhythms matched his appearance. The two guitarists, Jon Livingston and Jason Ketterer (Ian's brother), played intertwining melodies, often lifting the songs from their dimness while embracing the mystery in the lyrics.

There's a clear sense of how deeply this band cares about its work. Among Authors' music isn't casual; there are songs within their songs, and they're not always catchy. They take you on a journey — one I'll continue to follow.

July 22, 2019 | Collin Marshall -- As the the NPR staff gathered to watch his performance, Jacob Collier sprinted full bore down the hallway. It seems the North London 24-year-old can hardly contain his creative energy. It comes out in his wardrobe and most definitely in his music, but it's not misdirected or out of control. These are intricate and precise compositions, like a ship in a bottle made of thousands of planks of wood, yet light enough to sail in a breeze. It's on a scale you wouldn't imagine. Here's an example: This year he covered Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer's "Moon River" by recording himself 5,000 times and working in 144 other vocal submissions, and then he printed and sold signed copies of his Logic Pro audio session for fans while on tour. Though this is is a regular day for Jacob, his output continues to astonish everyone around him, both in its quality and sheer quantity. This year alone, he's putting out a project called Djesse with four distinct and complete volumes. Many of the songs are being written along the way, including one crafted specifically for the Tiny Desk called "It Don't Matter."

The whole Tiny Desk Concert has a lot to unpack. Check my math, but by my count Jacob plays seven instruments, if you include his singing. And you should — Jacob's stamp has always been to use voice in his compositions like a Swiss army knife, and virtually every combination of band members harmonizes at some point in the show. It's reflective of his philosophy on music as a connecting tool, to use the instrument we all possess, which drew me to his art in the first place. And as if to make good on those beliefs and bring all of us into one moment, he invited the crowd to sing the final lyrics of the concert together. It was the end of the show, but not even close to the limit of Jacob's imaginative bounds. He obsessed over leaving us a gift: a fake ID fashioned out of a passport photo and an Oyster Card — London's public transit fare card — which now sits on the hallowed shelves of the Tiny Desk. Extra credit if you can spot it in future episodes.

June 26, 2019 | Josh Rogosin -- One of my favorite things about Tiny Desk concerts is that artists are often inspired to experiment. Betty Who was in town recently for a three-night residency at D.C.'s famed 9:30 Club where her sound was larger than life. The subwoofers cranked out backing tracks you could feel in your gut and dancers flanked the pop star, punctuating every pulsating beat. But she began her Tiny Desk performance with only her cello and her voice — the first time she's ever accompanied one of her original songs with the instrument. She grew up in Sydney, Australia, and started playing at the age of four (just like Yo-Yo Ma). Maybe it had something to do with her mom being in the room, but emotions ran high for the charismatic and chatty singer. "I didn't want to be the girl who played cello and sang," she told the crowd gathered to watch. "'Cause that girl feels really far away from ass-out, sparkle-covered pop-star me."

Betty Who's third LP, Betty, falls squarely in the Roséwave, sun's-out, buns-out pop genre. When all the studio production is stripped away, what's left are intricate melodies that soar through Betty's impressive vocal range and relatable lyrics. As the audio engineer for the Tiny Desk concert series, I'm always curious how the vocals will translate without the aid of pitch correction and tons of effects you hear on the album. I'm a sucker for great melody and Betty Who's raw vocal performance at her Tiny Desk had me in a state of aural ecstasy.

Adding to the jazzy vibe of the intimate performance are Betty's touring musicians, Myla Bocage on keys and Ian Barnett on the drum pad. Jemila Dunham is in full-on beast-mode on bass.

Betty Who says she dreamed of having a Tiny Desk concert ever since she was a teenager. She chose to end hers by asking everyone to sing along to the track, "I Remember." The melody worms its way into my ear, whisking me off to summer in my mind's eye. Poolside. Glass of rosé in hand. Later, I'm jumping up and down at the club in perfect sync with new-found friends. Everyone's screaming along to the words as I realize I'm not sun-kissed, I'm sunburned. Never mind, it's time to sing:

Dancing under the stars

Kissing you in the dark

I remember your love, oh

Never giving you up, giving you up, oh

SET LIST
Taste
Friend Like Me
I Remember

Developed and published by Team 17 in 1991

Another video in my QHD remaster series, I was surprised to find that 2 versions of this beat 'em up exist.

The first version omits the extended credit sequence at the game's start, instead replacing it with a screen and scroll text for the backstory.

The second version - the one I used to own - seems to be older, with the game credited to Team 7 and 17 bit Software (the studio's name before they became Team 17). This version includes an extended credit sequence and alternative text that precedes each of the fights.

I've combined the intro sequences from these 2 versions for completeness, but the main game is taken from the later version.

Or could you? In the interests of sociological research, ABC’s Gerald Stone did a little survey. 

This episode of 'This Day Tonight' aired in 1967 (exact date of transmission unknown).

If you want to know one thing about making a machinima in Fortnite it's that it's super, super rad when you spend several hours late at night setting up footage in your virtual digital studio with the intent that you'll record the properly-composed shots in replay mode in the morning, only to wake up to a minor patch that breaks all your replays. It's extra rad when this happens three days in a row.

Neyman and Pearson developed a technique for statistical quality control in factories. Yet somehow, these two techniques were confused and merged into the Null Ritual of today, which is the neurotic pattern that every paper in many disciplines have to follow.</p><p>The Null Ritual is one of the clearest examples of academic consensus so far off the tracks that scholar treat the techniques in textbooks were religious devotion, rather than with critical awareness of what they are actually supposed to be. The end result? Nearly every field is rife with misuse of numbers, publication bias, misunderstandings and fake conclusions.</p><details>📚 See readings and other media.<p><em>Note that pay-walled academic articles may be obtained by feeding their URLs to sites like Sci-Hub.</em></p><ul><li><em>Rationality for Mortals</em> (Gerd Gigerenzer)</li><li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053535704000927">Mindless statistics</a> (Gerd Gigerenzer)</li><li><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2983785">Statistical Methods and Scientific Induction</a> (Ronald Fisher)</li><li><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1401671.pdf">"Inductive Behavior" as a Basic Concept of Philosophy of Science</a> (Jerzy Neyman)</li><li><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20445367">Inductive Inference or Inductive Behavior: Fisher and Neyman: Pearson Approaches to Statistical Testing in Psychological Research (1940-1960)</a> (Peter Halpin and Henderikus Stam)</li><li><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00223/full">Fisher, Neyman-Pearson or NHST?

<item><title>![CDATA[Meg Myers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert]]</title><description>![CDATA[March 6, 2019 | Robin Hilton -- Meg Myers put out one of 2018's most intense and cathartic albums. Take Me to the Disco raged and threw sonic punches at anyone who'd ever attempted to use or abuse her, from former record executives to past lovers. Dressed in a sparkling blue leotard, Myers re-creates that fire and ferocity behind the Tiny Desk, replacing her album's roaring electric guitars and electronics with a pulsing string quartet, piano and brushed drums.

But the most intense part of the performance is Myers herself. The distant, piercing looks she gives during the set's opening cut, "Jealous Sea," are unforgettable and unforgiving as she sings about a rat's nest of feelings — anger, fear, jealousy, desire — over an ex. "Everything's right, everything's wrong / When you call my name," she sings while half-hugging herself. "And I don't think I can stop the jealousy / When it comes, it comes like waves and I can't breathe."

Myers follows with a searing version of what she calls "a very lovely, uplifting song" from Take Me to the Disco called "Tear Me to Pieces," a frenzied takedown of liars, buried secrets and "wicked temptations." She then dials back the fury and indignation to close with a surprising version of "Running Up That Hill" by Kate Bush. Myers is a longtime fan, and often gets compared to the British singer. But Myers tells the audience she fell in love with the song for its meaning. "It's about men and women and the differences between them, and learning to have empathy for each other."

At the end of it all, standing behind the desk, Myers seems to finally exhale and let go of the fury as she paws playfully at her band, grateful to have gotten through it together.

Set List
"Jealous Sea"
"Tear Me to Pieces"
"Running Up That Hill"

Musicians
Meg Myers: bass, vocals; Jared Shavelson: drums, percussion; Josh Rheault: keys; Kristin Bakkegard: violin; Livy Amoruso: violin; Paul Bagley: viola; Carol Anne Bosco: cello
