The internet forums, the old youtube, message boards, meme sites, and overall a much more expressive era. Perhaps there are lessons to be learned from that time period, from the golden age of the internet. \n\nSpeaking of social media, I try to keep mine as non-toxic and positive as possible.

When Martin Josephson, who lives in London, came home from work, he heard his Amazon Echo Dot voice assistant spitting out fragmentary commands, seemingly based on his previous interactions with the device.

Three years earlier, he had volunteered to sit in a room reciting a string of apparently meaningless phrases into a microphone for an undisclosed purpose. Only when Amazon released the Echo in the US in 2014 did he realise what he had been working on. He bought a Dot, the Echo\u2019s cheaper, smaller model, after it launched in 2016, and found it useful enough until the day it went haywire. When the Dot\u2019s outburst subsided, he unplugged it and deposited it in the bin. \u201cI felt a bit foolish,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving worked at Amazon, and having seen how they used people\u2019s data, I knew I couldn\u2019t trust them.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants\">Continue reading...</a>", "title": "'Alexa, are you invading my privacy?' \u2013 the dark side of our voice assistants", "language": "en-UK", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants", "permanent": false, "source_obj__id": 167, "page_rating_votes": 0, "album": null, "date_published": "2019-10-09T05:00:41+00:00", "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_contents": 0, "artist": null, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "tags": ["big tech", "voice assistant", "privacy", "surveillance", "iot", "technofeudalism"], "thumbnail": null, "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0}, {"age": 0, "comments": [], "dead": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": true, "description": "The Cave Rescuer Suing Elon Musk Claims The Tesla CEO Fabricated Pedophilia Claims Against Him", "title": "The Cave Rescuer Suing Elon Musk Claims The Tesla CEO Fabricated Pedophilia Claims Against Him", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/unsworth-reply-elon-musk-fucking-idiot", "permanent": false, "page_rating_votes": 0, "album": null, "date_published": "2019-10-08T12:21:11+00:00", "user": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "artist": null, "source": "https://www.buzzfeednews.com", "tags": ["elites", "elon musk", "billionaires", "lie"], "thumbnail": null, "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0}, {"age": 0, "comments": [], "dead": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": true, "description": "One of America\u2019s biggest gaming companies is acting as China\u2019s censor", "title": "One of America\u2019s biggest gaming companies is acting as China\u2019s censor", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.vox.com/2019/10/8/20904433/blizzard-hong-kong-hearthstone-blitzchung", "permanent": false, "page_rating_votes": 0, "album": null, "date_published": "2019-10-08T12:08:47+00:00", "user": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "artist": null, "source": "https://www.vox.com", "tags": ["china", "blizzard", "censorship"], "thumbnail": null, "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0}, {"age": 0, "comments": [], "dead": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": true, "description": "Americans\u2019 Views of \u2018Socialism\u2019 and \u2018Capitalism\u2019 In Their Own Words | Pew Research Center", "title": "Americans\u2019 Views of \u2018Socialism\u2019 and \u2018Capitalism\u2019 In Their Own Words | Pew Research Center", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/10/07/in-their-own-words-behind-americans-views-of-socialism-and-capitalism/", "permanent": false, "page_rating_votes": 0, "album": null, "date_published": "2019-10-07T14:16:45+00:00", "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_contents": 0, "artist": null, "source": "https://www.pewresearch.org", "tags": ["socialism", "usa"], "thumbnail": null, "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0}, {"age": 0, "comments": [], "dead": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": true, "description": "The Nazis' love affair with the occult - Big Think", "title": "The Nazis' love affair with the occult - Big Think", "language": "en-US", "link": "https://bigthink.com/the-present/nazis-occult/", "permanent": false, "page_rating_votes": 0, "album": null, "date_published": "2019-10-06T08:03:35+00:00", "user": "rumpel", "page_rating_contents": 0, "artist": null, "source": "https://bigthink.com", "tags": ["occult", "himmler", "nazi"], "thumbnail": null, "vote": 0, "page_rating": 0}, {"age": 0, "comments": [], "dead": false, "page_rating_visits": 0, "bookmarked": true, "description": "<p>It can pick out shoplifters, international criminals and lost children in seconds.

The congress promotes conservative Christian family values. This event was enormously controversial in Italy and attracted 20,000 protesters to the city, the protesters said the congress was homophobic and wanted to restrict women's freedom, keep them at home doing the ironing, take Italy back to the middle ages. Notes / explanations:\n\n00:10 The host is Eva Crosetta who presents a religious affairs programme on Italian state broadcaster RAI.\n\n05:08 Infant's income = 400 euros a month, per child, up to the age of six, a Fratelli d'Italia policy.\n\n05:10 Citizen's income = a form of social welfare introduced for people living below the poverty line (earning less than 780 euros a month). One of Five Star's flagship policies.\n\n05:22 Nursery schools in Italy (asili nido) are for kids aged 1-3.\n\n05:34 Law 194 = 1978 law that legalised abortion in Italy. Meloni is saying that parts of the law can be applied to provide assistance for mothers who choose not to have an abortion.\n\n06:45 Comuni = small municipalities. Meloni is talking about the growth of towns in medieval Italy. This was important in terms of commerce, culture, development of legal rights and government. Italy was the most highly urbanised part of the world at the time.\n\n06:53 Matera = Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio (who opposed the congress) was caught on camera asking the governor of Puglia what he was doing regarding the town of Matera (which is not in Puglia, it is Basilicata).Di Maio later responded to the media saying he knew Matera wasn't in Puglia but that Puglia was in fact receiving funds related to Matera (Matera is one of the European Capitals of Culture) including for a railway, and that is what he was asking about.\n\n08:46 Single thinking = ideological dogmatism on a particular subject, ideological orthodoxy, refusal to accept alternative ideas on what the solution to a problem is.\n\n09:34 This is a well known case in Italy. The parents in question were actually 57 and 69 when their daughter was born.\n\n10:12 Eluana Englaro's father fought for years to be able to switch off her life support, before finally being permitted to do so.\n\n10:27 Charlie Gard and Alfie Evans were infants whose life support was switched off against the wishes of their parents.\n\n12:53 \"We will defend God, country and family.\" Meloni was criticised for this quote, people saying it was from Mussolini. It was actually originally made by Giuseppe Mazzini, a major figure in Italy's Risorgimento (19th century unification).\n\n13:14 GK Chesterton, British conservative writer. Salvini, who also spoke at this conference, about 20 minutes after Meloni, also used this quote at the end of his speech. The crowd started laughing and Salvini realised someone has said it already. He took in good spirit. \"Who said it? As a gentleman I take a step back.
