After exchanging pleasantries on the phone with his mother and manager, Bose Ogulu, she made it clear there wouldn't be time for much of anything else. \"Burna has been working really hard so please bear with us,\" she told me. \"The band will arrive well before him. Let me know the latest time at which he can arrive.\"\n\nThe Nigerian singer and songwriter is one of the biggest African artists in the world. He's also a pioneer of Afro-fusion which incorporates sonics and influences from a myriad of genres, laid on an Afrobeat foundation. The sound has been inescapable this year. The man born Damini Ogulu has been touring the world for the majority of 2019 and has at least 10 songs in the current nightclub rotation. Beyonc\u00e9 took notice and offered him a place on The Lion King soundtrack, The Lion King: The Gift.\n\nSandwiched between two sold-out concerts in Washington D.C., his Tiny Desk performance offers something relatively different from what we're used to seeing at his rowdy stage shows. He's more reflective here and restrained, allowing his songwriting to shine. In the spirit of one of his heroes, Fela Kuti, he weaves through highlights from his breakout album, African Giant, that are liable to move your body as much as your social consciousness.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Gbona\"\n\"Wetin Man Go Do\"\n\"Dangote\"\n\"Ye\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nBurna Boy: vocals; Emmanuel \"Manny\" Abiola-Jacobs: drums; Michael \"Maestro\" Masade Jr.: keys; Jola Ade: keys; Gaetan Judd: guitar; Christina Matovu: vocals; Otis \"Bdoc\" Mensah: bass\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Bobby Carter, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Bronson Arcuri, CJ Riculan, Jack Corbett; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Mhari Shaw/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaaYgVRZTnE", "date_published": "2019-11-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://www.techrepublic.com", "title": "How to keep employees happy: LinkedIn study reveals three factors", "description": "How to keep employees happy: LinkedIn study reveals three factors", "link": "https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-keep-employees-happy-linkedin-study-reveals-three-factors/", "date_published": "2019-11-21 09:13:58+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["managment", "programming", "it"]}, {"source": "https://fee.org", "title": "Solar Panels Produce Tons of Toxic Waste\u2014Literally -

But things weren't always this way, in fact, there was once a time where things were far more hopeful than they are today. The internet forums, the old youtube, message boards, meme sites, and overall a much more expressive era. Perhaps there are lessons to be learned from that time period, from the golden age of the internet. \n\nSpeaking of social media, I try to keep mine as non-toxic and positive as possible. Below are some links to sites where I occasionally post extra content and share things publicly. Also, I've brought back my patreon but it will be on a per-video basis instead of monthly.

As a kid you're sucked through the cosmos into an evil theme park from which there is no escape. The performances, miniature sets and sound design is absolutely fantastic. You get lost in a deadly and immersive world that genuinely terrified me as a child. The fact so much love and attention to detail has been crushed to fit on a 1996 CD-ROM is a tragedy.\n\nI think Escape From Horrorland deserves a 4K remaster, a VR experience, and a book of HorrorLand artwork and production stills. It may be a legal nightmare but it\u2019s a Kickstarter campaign I would contribute handsomely to.\n\nMAKEUP\nAusten Mengler https://www.austenmengler.com/\nHayley Robinson\n\nCAMERA OPERATOR\nSteven Sorrento https://stevensorrento.com/\n\nLOCATION\nFremantle RoundHouse, Western Australia\nhttps://www.fremantleroundhouse.com.au/\n\nEDITING & VISUAL EFFECTS\nNick Bertke\nhttp://www.pogomix.net/\n\nMUSIC PRODUCTION\nPogo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/Pogo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhEXRQ5ndI0", "date_published": "2019-10-29 15:47:22+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["music"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCSiPjfAJBgbFlIUsxOWpK0w", "title": "Mr. Blue Sky | Electric Light Orchestra | Pomplamoose", "description": "Gardenview out now, listen on Spotify (https://sptfy.com/gardenview) or wherever you listen to music.\n\n Save this song on Spotify: https://spoti.fi/2r3Yqkh\nFollow us on instagram: https://instagram.com/pomplamoosemusic\nBecome a patron of our music (to vote on the songs we cover and get merch and stuff like that): http://www.patreon.com/pomplamoose\n\nA cover of Mr. Blue Sky by Pomplamoose.\n\nCREDITS\n\nLead Vocals: Nataly Dawn\nKeys/marxophone: Jack Conte\nGuitar: Brian Green \nBass: Nick Campbell\nDrums: Julian Allen\nBackground Vocals: Nahneen Kula\nSynthesizer: Dave Mackay\nEngineer: Tim Sonnefeld \nAssistant Engineer: Jason Clark\nMixing/Mastering: Caleb Parker\nProducers: Ben Rose & Caleb Parker\n\nVideo Production: Ricky Chavez\nVideo Direction: Merlin Showalter\nCamera Operators: Sammy Rothman, Dijon Herron\nVideo Editor: Dominic Mercurio\n\nRecorded at Band House Studios in Los Angeles.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyUNDr0EcAk", "date_published": "2019-10-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["music"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCnxGkOGNMqQEUMvroOWps6Q", "title": "Edward Snowden: How Your Cell Phone Spies on You", "description": "Edward Snowden: How Your Cell Phone Spies on You", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFns39RXPrU", "date_published": "2019-10-23 19:56:19+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["smartphone", "privacy", "edward snowden"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCB4x7sPXy30bRblHS9QNEQQ", "title": "Smart City: How do you live in a Smart City? | Future Smart City Projects | Surveillance or Utopia?", "description": "Smart City: How do you live in a Smart City? | Future Smart City Projects | Surveillance or Utopia?", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRRPy-yEKRM", "date_published": "2019-10-22 19:55:30+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["smart city", "privacy", "surveillance"]}, {"source": "https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org", "title": "Event 201, a pandemic exercise to illustrate preparedness efforts", "description": "Event 201, a pandemic exercise to illustrate preparedness efforts", "link": "https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/exercises/event201/", "date_published": "2019-10-18 07:29:13+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en", "tags": ["event 201", "pandemic", "bill gates", "covid"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCSiPjfAJBgbFlIUsxOWpK0w", "title": "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger | Daft Punk | Pomplamoose", "description": "All of our Daft Punk covers are now on one Daft Pomp album.

When Martin Josephson, who lives in London, came home from work, he heard his Amazon Echo Dot voice assistant spitting out fragmentary commands, seemingly based on his previous interactions with the device. It appeared to be regurgitating requests to book train tickets for journeys he had already taken and to record TV shows that he had already watched. Josephson had not said the wake word \u2013 \u201cAlexa\u201d \u2013 to activate it and nothing he said would stop it. It was, he says, \u201cKafkaesque\u201d.</p><p>This was especially interesting because Josephson (not his real name) was a former Amazon employee. Three years earlier, he had volunteered to sit in a room reciting a string of apparently meaningless phrases into a microphone for an undisclosed purpose. Only when Amazon released the Echo in the US in 2014 did he realise what he had been working on. He bought a Dot, the Echo\u2019s cheaper, smaller model, after it launched in 2016, and found it useful enough until the day it went haywire. When the Dot\u2019s outburst subsided, he unplugged it and deposited it in the bin. \u201cI felt a bit foolish,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving worked at Amazon, and having seen how they used people\u2019s data, I knew I couldn\u2019t trust them.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants", "date_published": "2019-10-09 05:00:41+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-UK", "tags": ["big tech", "voice assistant", "privacy", "surveillance", "iot", "technofeudalism"]}, {"source": "https://www.buzzfeednews.com", "title": "The Cave Rescuer Suing Elon Musk Claims The Tesla CEO Fabricated Pedophilia Claims Against Him", "description": "The Cave Rescuer Suing Elon Musk Claims The Tesla CEO Fabricated Pedophilia Claims Against Him", "link": "https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/unsworth-reply-elon-musk-fucking-idiot", "date_published": "2019-10-08 12:21:11+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["elites", "elon musk", "billionaires", "lie"]}, {"source": "https://www.vox.com", "title": "One of America\u2019s biggest gaming companies is acting as China\u2019s censor", "description": "One of America\u2019s biggest gaming companies is acting as China\u2019s censor", "link": "https://www.vox.com/2019/10/8/20904433/blizzard-hong-kong-hearthstone-blitzchung", "date_published": "2019-10-08 12:08:47+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["china", "blizzard", "censorship"]}, {"source": "https://www.pewresearch.org", "title": "Americans\u2019 Views of \u2018Socialism\u2019 and \u2018Capitalism\u2019 In Their Own Words | Pew Research Center", "description": "Americans\u2019 Views of \u2018Socialism\u2019 and \u2018Capitalism\u2019 In Their Own Words | Pew Research Center", "link": "https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/10/07/in-their-own-words-behind-americans-views-of-socialism-and-capitalism/", "date_published": "2019-10-07 14:16:45+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["socialism", "usa"]}, {"source": "https://bigthink.com", "title": "The Nazis' love affair with the occult - Big Think", "description": "The Nazis' love affair with the occult - Big Think", "link": "https://bigthink.com/the-present/nazis-occult/", "date_published": "2019-10-06 08:03:35+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["occult", "himmler", "nazi"]}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "'We are hurtling towards a surveillance state\u2019: the rise of facial recognition technology", "description": "<p>It can pick out shoplifters, international criminals and lost children in seconds.

The odds of this unsigned, self-managed quartet playing a Tiny Desk concert was pretty small, but Among Authors is a band that beats the odds. Nearly a dozen years ago, at 23, bandleader Ian Ketterer had open-heart surgery. Born without a thumb on his right hand and deaf in his right ear, he plays piano and sings. And, out of more than 6,000 entries to our 2018 Tiny Desk Contest, Among Authors was one of the most original bands I'd seen \u2014 so much so that we invited the group to perform as part of our Tiny Desk Contest tour in Seattle. I was even more impressed by Among Authors' songwriting and keen, spare musicianship at that KEXP-sponsored event, so I invited them to play a Tiny Desk concert. By the time their big day came, nearly a year later, they were ready \u2014 nervous, but ready.\n\nIan Ketterer sat behind our upright piano, partially hidden by his hair and hoodie. Patrick Brockwell's clean look provided a stark contrast, and his no-frills, perfectly placed rhythms matched his appearance. The two guitarists, Jon Livingston and Jason Ketterer (Ian's brother), played intertwining melodies, often lifting the songs from their dimness while embracing the mystery in the lyrics.\n\nThere's a clear sense of how deeply this band cares about its work. Among Authors' music isn't casual; there are songs within their songs, and they're not always catchy. They take you on a journey \u2014 one I'll continue to follow.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Radio Signals\"\n\"The Overture\"\n\"Lure\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nIan Ketterer: piano, vocals; Jason Ketterer: guitar; Jon Livingston: guitar; Patrick Brockwell: drums\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Jeremiah Rhodes, Morgan Noelle Smith, Bronson Arcuri; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Production Assistant: Paul Georgoulis; Photo: Olivia Falcigno/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0uhEHIU6Sk", "date_published": "2019-08-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://nypost.com", "title": "Haunting photos show Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s \u2018Pedophile Island\u2019 in the Caribbean", "description": "Haunting photos show Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s \u2018Pedophile Island\u2019 in the Caribbean", "link": "https://nypost.com/2019/08/15/haunting-photos-show-jeffrey-epsteins-pedophile-island-in-the-caribbean/#1", "date_published": "2019-08-15 08:26:20+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en-US", "tags": ["island", "secret societies", "jeffrey epstein", "paedophilia"]}, {"source": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss", "title": "Volkswagen and Philadelphia ads banned for gender stereotypes", "description": "An advertisement juxtaposing male astronauts with a woman sitting by a stroller, and another depicting two hapless dads, are the first casualties of a British ban on gender stereotypes in advertising.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/14/media/uk-adverts-banned-gender-stereotypes-scli-gbr-intl/index.html", "date_published": "2019-08-14 11:27:26+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["social engineering", "the left wing"]}, {"source": "https://www.woodmac.com", "title": "Copper: Powering Up The Electric Vehicle | Wood Mackenzie", "description": "Copper: Powering Up The Electric Vehicle | Wood Mackenzie", "link": "https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/copper-powering-up-the-electric-vehicle/", "date_published": "2019-08-13 14:02:26+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["electric vehicles"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCor9rW6PgxSQ9vUPWQdnaYQ", "title": "A HIDDEN LIFE -

It seems the North London 24-year-old can hardly contain his creative energy. It comes out in his wardrobe and most definitely in his music, but it's not misdirected or out of control. These are intricate and precise compositions, like a ship in a bottle made of thousands of planks of wood, yet light enough to sail in a breeze. It's on a scale you wouldn't imagine. Here's an example: This year he covered Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer's \"Moon River\" by recording himself 5,000 times and working in 144 other vocal submissions, and then he printed and sold signed copies of his Logic Pro audio session for fans while on tour. Though this is is a regular day for Jacob, his output continues to astonish everyone around him, both in its quality and sheer quantity. This year alone, he's putting out a project called Djesse with four distinct and complete volumes. Many of the songs are being written along the way, including one crafted specifically for the Tiny Desk called \"It Don't Matter.\"\n\nThe whole Tiny Desk Concert has a lot to unpack. Check my math, but by my count Jacob plays seven instruments, if you include his singing. And you should \u2014 Jacob's stamp has always been to use voice in his compositions like a Swiss army knife, and virtually every combination of band members harmonizes at some point in the show. It's reflective of his philosophy on music as a connecting tool, to use the instrument we all possess, which drew me to his art in the first place. And as if to make good on those beliefs and bring all of us into one moment, he invited the crowd to sing the final lyrics of the concert together. It was the end of the show, but not even close to the limit of Jacob's imaginative bounds. He obsessed over leaving us a gift: a fake ID fashioned out of a passport photo and an Oyster Card \u2014 London's public transit fare card \u2014 which now sits on the hallowed shelves of the Tiny Desk.

Betty Who was in town recently for a three-night residency at D.C.'s famed 9:30 Club where her sound was larger than life. The subwoofers cranked out backing tracks you could feel in your gut and dancers flanked the pop star, punctuating every pulsating beat. But she began her Tiny Desk performance with only her cello and her voice \u2014 the first time she's ever accompanied one of her original songs with the instrument. She grew up in Sydney, Australia, and started playing at the age of four (just like Yo-Yo Ma). Maybe it had something to do with her mom being in the room, but emotions ran high for the charismatic and chatty singer. \"I didn't want to be the girl who played cello and sang,\" she told the crowd gathered to watch. \"'Cause that girl feels really far away from ass-out, sparkle-covered pop-star me.\"\n\nBetty Who's third LP, Betty, falls squarely in the Ros\u00e9wave, sun's-out, buns-out pop genre. When all the studio production is stripped away, what's left are intricate melodies that soar through Betty's impressive vocal range and relatable lyrics. As the audio engineer for the Tiny Desk concert series, I'm always curious how the vocals will translate without the aid of pitch correction and tons of effects you hear on the album. I'm a sucker for great melody and Betty Who's raw vocal performance at her Tiny Desk had me in a state of aural ecstasy.\n\nAdding to the jazzy vibe of the intimate performance are Betty's touring musicians, Myla Bocage on keys and Ian Barnett on the drum pad. Jemila Dunham is in full-on beast-mode on bass.\n\nBetty Who says she dreamed of having a Tiny Desk concert ever since she was a teenager. She chose to end hers by asking everyone to sing along to the track, \"I Remember.\" The melody worms its way into my ear, whisking me off to summer in my mind's eye. Poolside. Glass of ros\u00e9 in hand. Later, I'm jumping up and down at the club in perfect sync with new-found friends. Everyone's screaming along to the words as I realize I'm not sun-kissed, I'm sunburned. Never mind, it's time to sing:\n\nDancing under the stars\n\nKissing you in the dark\n\nI remember your love, oh\n\nNever giving you up, giving you up, oh\n\nSET LIST\nTaste\nFriend Like Me\nI Remember\n\nMUSICIANS\nBetty Who: lead vocals, cello; Ian Barnett: drums; Jemila Dunham: bass; Myla Bocage: keys\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Josh Rogosin, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Beck Harlan, Maia Stern, Jeremiah Rhodes; Production Assistant: Paul Georgoulis; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Photo: Shuran Huang/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AaXv14akQc", "date_published": "2019-07-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://theconversation.com", "title": "Amazon, Google and Facebook warrant antitrust scrutiny for many reasons \u2013 not just because they're large", "description": "Amazon, Google and Facebook warrant antitrust scrutiny for many reasons \u2013 not just because they're large", "link": "https://theconversation.com/amazon-google-and-facebook-warrant-antitrust-scrutiny-for-many-reasons-not-just-because-theyre-large-118370", "date_published": "2019-06-24 21:34:08+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["google", "facebook", "amazon", "antitrust"]}, {"source": "https://www.breitbart.com", "title": "'Men in Black: International' Review: Another Franchise Bites the Woke-Dust", "description": "'Men in Black: International' Review: Another Franchise Bites the Woke-Dust", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/06/14/men-in-black-international-review-another-franchise-bites-the-woke-dust/", "date_published": "2019-06-14 11:55:24+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["go woke go broke"]}, {"source": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss", "title": "Sexist commercials now banned in UK", "description": "Depictions of girls as less academic than boys, men being belittled for \"unmanly\" behavior, and an array of other cliched portrayals have been consigned to history in British commercials as new rules come into effect banning gender stereotypes in advertising.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/14/media/uk-gender-stereotypes-advertising-ban-scli-gbr-intl/index.html", "date_published": "2019-06-14 11:32:55+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["social engineering", "stereotypes", "the left wing"]}, {"source": "https://www.forbes.com", "title": "Report: The U.S. Military Emits More CO2 Than Many Industrialized Nations [Infographic]", "description": "Report: The U.S. Military Emits More CO2 Than Many Industrialized Nations [Infographic]", "link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2019/06/13/report-the-u-s-military-emits-more-co2-than-many-industrialized-nations-infographic/?sh=678b045e4372", "date_published": "2019-06-13 12:54:42+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["climate change", "carbon footprint", "carbon emissions"]}, {"source": "https://boundingintocomics.com", "title": "Report: Facebook Bans The Word \u201cHonk\u201d", "description": "Report: Facebook Bans The Word \u201cHonk\u201d", "link": "https://boundingintocomics.com/2019/06/11/report-facebook-bans-the-word-honk/", "date_published": "2019-06-11 22:09:15+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["facebook", "censorship"]}, {"source": "https://www.economist.com", "title": "Google rewards reputable reporting, not left-wing politics | The Economist", "description": "Google rewards reputable reporting, not left-wing politics | The Economist", "link": "https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/06/08/google-rewards-reputable-reporting-not-left-wing-politics", "date_published": "2019-06-08 14:36:32+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["algorithms", "search engines"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC3I2GFN_F8WudD_2jUZbojA", "title": "Jungle - Full Performance (Live on KEXP)", "description": "http://KEXP.ORG presents Jungle performing live in the KEXP studio.

Take Me to the Disco raged and threw sonic punches at anyone who'd ever attempted to use or abuse her, from former record executives to past lovers. Dressed in a sparkling blue leotard, Myers re-creates that fire and ferocity behind the Tiny Desk, replacing her album's roaring electric guitars and electronics with a pulsing string quartet, piano and brushed drums.\n\nBut the most intense part of the performance is Myers herself. The distant, piercing looks she gives during the set's opening cut, \"Jealous Sea,\" are unforgettable and unforgiving as she sings about a rat's nest of feelings \u2014 anger, fear, jealousy, desire \u2014 over an ex. \"Everything's right, everything's wrong / When you call my name,\" she sings while half-hugging herself. \"And I don't think I can stop the jealousy / When it comes, it comes like waves and I can't breathe.\"\n\nMyers follows with a searing version of what she calls \"a very lovely, uplifting song\" from Take Me to the Disco called \"Tear Me to Pieces,\" a frenzied takedown of liars, buried secrets and \"wicked temptations.\" She then dials back the fury and indignation to close with a surprising version of \"Running Up That Hill\" by Kate Bush. Myers is a longtime fan, and often gets compared to the British singer. But Myers tells the audience she fell in love with the song for its meaning. \"It's about men and women and the differences between them, and learning to have empathy for each other.\"\n\nAt the end of it all, standing behind the desk, Myers seems to finally exhale and let go of the fury as she paws playfully at her band, grateful to have gotten through it together.\n\nSet List\n\"Jealous Sea\"\n\"Tear Me to Pieces\"\n\"Running Up That Hill\"\n\nMusicians\nMeg Myers: bass, vocals; Jared Shavelson: drums, percussion; Josh Rheault: keys; Kristin Bakkegard: violin; Livy Amoruso: violin; Paul Bagley: viola; Carol Anne Bosco: cello\n\nCredits\nProducers: Robin Hilton, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Kaylee Domzalski, Kara Frame, Maia Stern; Editor: Kaylee Domzalski; Photo: Cameron Pollack/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSMt8qbhu0w", "date_published": "2019-03-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["concert", "music"]}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "title": "German academics and authors call for end to 'gender nonsense' | Germany | The Guardian", "description": "German academics and authors call for end to 'gender nonsense' | Germany | The Guardian", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/08/german-academics-and-authors-call-for-end-to-gender-nonsense", "date_published": "2019-03-08 09:07:02+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en", "tags": ["social engineering", "pronouns", "science is dead", "gender", "newspeak", "the left wing"]}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "title": "Revealed: Facebook\u2019s global lobbying against data privacy laws", "description": "Revealed: Facebook\u2019s global lobbying against data privacy laws", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/02/facebook-global-lobbying-campaign-against-data-privacy-laws-investment", "date_published": "2019-03-02 19:52:57+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": null, "language": "en", "tags": ["meta", "privacy", "facebook"]}, {"source": "https://www.quora.com", "title": "Why does Google limit results to only like 30 pages even for very popular search terms?", "description": "Why does Google limit results to only like 30 pages even for very popular search terms?", "link": "https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Google-limit-results-to-only-like-30-pages-even-for-very-popular-search-terms?share=1", "date_published": "2019-02-26 11:59:59+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["search engines"]}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCHJB_mpFHEjzrHgCO06a7Tg", "title": "Hang Massive - End of Sky [Official Video]", "description": "We are on tour again!\nTickets and info - http://hangmassive.co/tour\n\nThe second track from the new Hang Massive album \"Luminous Emptiness '\nWEBSITE \u27a4http://hangmassive.com\nTOUR DATES \u27a4https://hangmassive.com/pages/tour\n\nWe filmed this video in Sikkim in the north-east of India.
