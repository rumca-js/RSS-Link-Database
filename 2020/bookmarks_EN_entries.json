There's big money in it because\nobviously all of these companies put money in it, but also if you're a\nnormal person, you automatically assume you need the &quot;best&quot;\ntechnology.</p>\n<h2 id=\"do-you-need-a-modern-computer\">Do you need a modern computer?</h2>\n<p>Absolutely not. More than 95% of people could be using a computer from\n2008 or before without any problems. Needing a recent machine is limited\nto people who:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do extreme, professional, processor-intensive video-rendering.</li>\n<li>Compile massive programs and operating systems with severe time constraints.</li>\n<li>Play recent triple AAA video-games on high settings.</li>\n<li>Use many massive Electron apps and other inexcusably bad software\nwritten by soydevs and other people who shouldn't be writing\nsoftware.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The last two reasons aren't really real reasons at all because they are\ntotally unnecessary and avoidable things.</p>\n<p>But to the point, watching YouTube videos and using a word processor\ndoes not require last month's new release.</p>\n<p>Every video I upload, I transcode for settings optimal for YouTube,\nmeaning I render each video I record. On my computer from a decade ago,\nthat still takes only a couple minutes. A fancy $5000 computer might be\nable to do it in less than one, but it is honestly not worth the pain\nassociated with modern computers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-should-a-computer-cost-a-normal-person\">How much should a computer cost a normal person?</h3>\n<p>Either nothing or just around $200, I say. I use a ThinkPad X220 I got\nfor $90 on eBay. Before that, I used another ThinkPad X220 I also got\nfor $90. Like anything else, <strong>if you are buying things on Amazon,\nyou're doing it wrong</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-pain-of-modern-computers\">The Pain of Modern Computers</h2>\n<h3 id=\"modern-computers-are-more-breakable\">Modern computers are more breakable</h3>\n<p>As computing has become more and more popular, companies have started to\nrealize that a consumer's first reaction on having their $5 wifi card die is\nimmediately buy a whole new computer. This means two things: (1) they don't\nbother to make computers easy to repair, in fact, they make it more difficult\nand (2) there is absolutely no need to make computers durable at all. In fact,\nit's probably better to let computers break so you'll get yet another sale.</p>\n<p>Apple is by far the most anti-social computing company because of this.\nI'll let the larger tech channels show you the specifics, but every\nApple product is brilliantly designed to make it difficult to fix very\nbasic and otherwise fixable problems. They have quite a racket licensing\nout the ability and tools to companies that want to fix their terrible\nhardware. Apple even used pentalobe screws just so normal people\ncouldn't open their computers up with a typical screwdriver. Of course\nnowadays every other computer manufacturer imitates the Apple style\nwhere apparent &quot;sleekness&quot; is supposed to be a signal of high quality.</p>\n<h3 id=\"modern-computers-are-increasingly-monitoring-devices-and-come-with-proprietary-junk\">Modern computers are increasingly monitoring devices and come with proprietary junk.</h3>\n<h4 id=\"the-management-engine\">The Management Engine</h4>\n<p>You might've heard that all Intel i3/i5/i7 processors (that is, after\nthe Intel Core 2 Duo) have an onboard alternate processor that is meant\nto function as spyware. This is called the Intel Management Engine. It\ncan view your memory and connect to the internet: basically all modern\ncomputers have this permanent back door. In older computers, say the\nThinkPad X200, you can, with a little hardware action, remove the other\nprocessor and replace the proprietary BIOS with\n<a href=\"https://libreboot.org\">Libreboot</a> or <a href=\"https://coreboot.org\">Coreboot</a>,\nbut that is <em>not possible</em> on more modern computers (you can install\nCoreboot on a more modern machine, but not all of the components of the\nManagement Engine are removed).</p>\n<p>More recent computers, however are non-removable spyware by design and,\nyes, the NSA can monitor any machine with a Management Engine. There are\nactually even rumors that one of the taps that the FBI under the Obama\nadministration put on Trump during his campaign was a Management Engine\nbug.</p>\n<p>Note that AMD (Ryzen) processors have what they call a &quot;Platform\nSecurity Processor&quot; that is equivalent to the Intel Management Engine,\nso you're not escaping the issue by using one of them.</p>\n<h4 id=\"nvidia\">NVIDIA</h4>\n<p>Again, unless you play modern videos alone all day, you literally have\nno reason to have a modern computer, especially one with an expensive\ngraphics card. NVIDIA is a great example because they make graphics\ncards and develop proprietary drivers for them to make it harder and\nharder to use them on machines that aren't running whatever the most\nrecent spyware variant of Windows 10 is. Linux works perfectly on all\ncomputers ancient and modern, but if you plug some NVIDIA thing up to\nit, you might lose your screen or not be able to boot. A lot of gaymers\nwhine about their NVIDIA products &quot;not working&quot; on Linux without\nrealizing <strong>that is by design</strong>. NVIDIA and other companies and all CPU\ndesigners go out of their way to keep their source code and standards\nprivate which makes their products tangibly worse because it is harder\nfor other parties to write drivers for them. Why? Because most of them\nhave partnerships with Microsoft.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-problem-of-windows\">The Problem of Windows</h3>\n<p>How many times have you heard a normie explain to you that their\ncomputer is slow because it's &quot;really old&quot; and they bought it &quot;way\nback in 2015?&quot; It's an absurd statement of course. Computers don't\njust get magically slow... <strong>...unless they've been running\nWindows.</strong></p>\n<p>In the future, once even Microsoft has switched over to a purely\nUnix-based backend for their operating system, we're all going to have\na good laugh about how Microsoft Windows, <em>literally the worst and least\nfunctioning operating system ever devised</em>, was the largest consumer\nmarket share for decades.</p>\n<p>I might go into how Windows is poorly designed in another page or video,\nbut I want to be clear that there is no such loss of speed on any Linux\ndistribution, which is what you should be using. I am one of the first\nto complain about the feature bloat of the Linux kernel and Linux\nsoftware, but compared to Windows, it's no contest: <strong>Linux runs fast\non old hardware</strong>. You'll know from some of my videos, however, that\nI'm not <em>big</em> into &quot;Linux Evangelism,&quot; mostly because it's sort of\nstrident and doesn't really work with a high success rate. Using Linux\nis just something that normies have been immunized against (mostly\nbecause &quot;It's what smart people do&quot;), but I always find myself in a\nposition where someone's Window installation has permanently crashed\nand they're at the awkward decision of having to <em>buy a license</em> to\nreinstall the dysfunctional and slow operating system they've grown to\nhate.</p>\n<p>There is quite literally no problem that normal people have with\ncomputers that is not immediately alleviated by installing Linux.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-do-people-use-thinkpads\">Why do people use ThinkPads?</h2>\n<p>As I said above, I use a X220 ThinkPad. Older ThinkPads are fairly popular among people who think and care about doing things effectively and economically on a computer. Why is this?</p>\n<p>ThinkPads were always designed for enterprise environments, meaning the financial incentives for the manufacturer are not always planned obsolesce, but a long-standing reputation among large companies of having durable, fixable and expandable machines.</p>\n<p>To replace a hard drive on the X200 requires unscrewing just a single screw. Same to replace the memory. To replace a spoiled keyboard is no more than three screws.\nModern laptops, including the degraded modern ThinkPad have abandoned this simplicity and opt for the Apple-Mac/cell phone design technique of making batteries, memory and the rest functionally soldered and irremovable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-far-can-500-go\">How far can $500 go?</h3>\n<p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve had many things break on my laptops, but since I&rsquo;ve been using ThinkPads, it is incredibly easy to keep a working computer even after rough use. I estimate that I have never spent more than a combined total of $500 on computers, which is usually a bare minimum for what someone can buy a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; laptop for nowadays.</p>\n<p>When the keyboard on my ThinkPad breaks, I can just buy a replacement keyboard for $30 or $40 and replace the old one much easier than any other model. That&rsquo;s the modularity of these computers.</p>\n<p>Even in the worst case scenario when something on the motherboard makes the computer unbootable, I still get to keep my &ldquo;broken&rdquo; ThinkPad and repurpose the memory, wifi card, keyboard and everything else. I still have some parts of every laptop I&rsquo;ve had just because they do come in a lot of use. The other month, a friend&rsquo;s wifi on his desktop went out and I could replace it with one of my old ThinkPad modules.</p>\n<p>This is the kind of thing you lose with modern computers. This is purposeful on the part of manufacturers, and it&rsquo;s important not to pay them huge amounts of money to incentivize this behavior. It&rsquo;s very easy to live off of 10 year old computers nowadays. The eBay-and-etc resale market is massive even thought many of us have gotten wise to the value of these old computers.</p>", "permanent": false, "language": "en-US", "source_obj__id": 18, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/only-use-old-computers/", "bookmarked": true, "vote": 0}, {"thumbnail": null, "tags": [], "page_rating_visits": 0, "title": "Science vs. Soyence", "page_rating_contents": 0, "age": 0, "date_published": "2020-12-11T00:00:00+00:00", "page_rating_votes": 0, "comments": [], "source": "https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml", "user": null, "page_rating": 0, "description": "<figure class=\"titleimg\"><img src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/soyence.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n<p>There's nothing necessarily <em>wrong</em> with science, reason, knowledge\netc. To some degree, they're fundamental for survival in this world in\none way or another. But one of the more worrisome problems which have\narisen since the Enlightenment, and especially in the past several\nyears, is the fact that whenever scientific knowledge has increased,\nhuman arrogance has accelerated even faster. This isn't a metaphysical,\nmoral arrogance; it's one that is more and more jeopardizing the human\ncosmos.</p>\n<p>We live in a pop-scientific and pop-technological world. Because common\npeople are constantly weighing themselves down with new gadgets and\nstate-of-the-art genetically engineered food, there's a tendency to\nwant to pay homage to the amorphous blob of &quot;knowledge.&quot; Of course,\nmuch like the Greek Gods, we cannot seem to speak to &quot;knowledge&quot;\ndirectly, or to mentally murky academics, but only to official\nmediators: journalists and &quot;science communicators&quot; and the like.</p>\n<p>The religious metaphor is intentional. Of course the actual view of\nPopperian science is that scientific &quot;advancement&quot; is less of an\nincrease in knowledge than a decrease in falsity. We can never be sure\nof what is true, but we can gradually establish what is false and\ncontradictory; science does exclusively the latter. Real scientific work\nrefutes and calls into question established fact and is in a constant\nself-regeneration. Facts mean nothing in themselves.</p>\n<p>And scientific models, from our models of the atom, to models of the\nEarth's weather and climate, to models of our body are highly\ncircumstantial, and as a rule, will nearly all inevitably be proven\nfalse. Theories are the narratives we cast over facts which have not yet\nbeen ruled false. We know nearly nothing of how the brain works. Sure,\nwe know there are synapses, and we know what brains end up doing in some\ncircumstances, but we haven't begun to scratch the surface of how a\nbrain is actually engineered (computational models be damned). The same\nis true of the human body and is especially true of human society.</p>\n<p>Now Neil deGrasse Tyson has the annoying mantra that he repeats at every\npossible opportunity, which goes something like: &quot;the good thing about\nscience is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.&quot; First\noff, I don't know what's good about that; it'd be pretty damn\nconvenient to live in a world where we could imagine away gravity or CO2\nor cancer, but aside from this, science, actual science as a critical\nmethodology is manifestly <em>not</em> true and is <em>not</em> the truth. Science is\na way of marginally approaching truth by discovering falsity, and in\nmost endeavors, this approachment is so marginal as to be inert in all\nour daily lives. There is nothing to &quot;believe in&quot; in science anyway,\nbecause it's an exposer of <em>non</em>-truth.</p>\n<p>But in pop-science, Science<sup>\u00ae</sup> is &quot;knowledge&quot; and deviation from the\nscientific catechism is &quot;irrational.&quot; It's not just irrational to\ndispute consensus, but irrational to <em>fail to implement it in your\npersonal life</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"in-practice\">In Practice</h2>\n<p>The greatest danger of pop-science is the unquestioned assumption that\nlife should be led &quot;scientifically.&quot; That we should &quot;look for\nevidence,&quot; &quot;question everything,&quot; and universally &quot;challenge\nauthority&quot; (unless that authority is a professor). The problem should\nbe blatantly obvious in hindsight.</p>\n<p>An obvious example: in the 20th century, Western societies had to deal\nwith the very real problem of a bizarre increase in lung cancer rates.\nWe &quot;know&quot; now that smoking tobacco and other substances apparently\ncause drastically higher lung cancer rates, but this was lost on the\npeople at the time.</p>\n<p>The relationship between smoking and cancer was highly circumstantial;\nthere were some statistical correlations established, but as any\npop-science guru will tell us &quot;correlation is not causation!&quot; For\ndecades, scientifically minded people looked for evidence while millions\nmore died. Smoking companies took refuge in the fact that there was no\n<em>mechanism</em> understood behind how smoking could cause lung cancer. With\nall scientific rigor, they insisted for decades that the increase in\nlung cancer was due to something else, or merely an increase in\ndiagnosis capacity. And <em>they were on the side of scientific\nskepticism!</em></p>\n<p>Only now that there is some understanding of how carcinogens in smoke\ncan damage the lungs can we say that the &quot;scientific consensus&quot; is\nthat smoking causes lung cancer. Cute, but if people had been\n<em>&quot;irrationally&quot; cautious</em>, the human tragedy would've been\nsubstantially mitigated.</p>\n<p>The problem is that &quot;looking for evidence&quot; before acting or non-acting\nis personally and socially dangerous. In nearly all circumstances, our\nintuition (crafted by millions of years of evolution) or social norms\n(which keep us to established safe routes) are much better guides to\nlife than the scientific consensus, despite them being &quot;irrational&quot;\n(and sorry, religion is part of this too). When someone guzzles down\nsome newly fabricated energy drink or gallons of soda, they're nearly\ncertainly damaging their bodies in ways science does not yet understand.\nDon't wait 40 years for some longitudinal peer-reviewed study to prove\nthat eating plastic is bad for you. Trust your instincts before you give\ncredence to some YouTuber who says inane things like &quot;There's no\nevidence that...&quot;</p>\n<p>My favorite little &quot;irrationality&quot; that we all commit is of course,\nsleep. After millennia of trying to understand it, there is no\nestablished scientific reason or justification for why humans &quot;need&quot;\nsleep. Sure there are hypotheses (memory processing, repair, maybe even\nsomething Freudian), but none close to common currency. In the words of\none of the world's most prominent sleep researchers, William Denent,\n&quot;As far as I know, the only reason we need to sleep that is really,\nreally solid is because we get sleepy.&quot; Of course the absence of\nlogical evidence to the necessity of sleep keeps no NdGT fan from\nwasting their time on the &quot;Bronze-Age Myth&quot; of the importance of\nsleep.</p>\n<h2 id=\"not-mis-understanding-complex-systems\">(Not) (Mis-)Understanding Complex Systems</h2>\n<p>The human body is a complex system in which every &quot;system&quot; is\noverlapping, somewhat redundant, all-affecting and fundamentally beyond\nlinear analysis. Our scientific studies can find binary variables that\ncorrelate with a low <em>p</em> value, but that tells us nothings about what's\nactually going on and nothing about the underlying mechanisms. Again,\nthe same is true of the human brain and the same is true of human\n<em>society</em>. Nothing is a simple input-output system.</p>\n<p>What this means is that basically nothing from the world of pop-science\ncan <em>ever</em> affect the basics of our lives because the interaction of our\ncomponent parts are just non-amenable to any kind of generalizations\nthat make intuitive sense to us. Everything we do affects our bodies in\nways we can't predict so the proper strategy is always an\n&quot;irrational&quot; precaution and avoidance of novelty.</p>\n<p>Things, of course, get especially touchy when talking about the\n&quot;rational&quot; management of society. Every good denizen of the\npost-Enlightenment world, even most of those on the &quot;Right&quot; have the\nidea that the economy and social relationships are simple one-to-one\nhydraulic systems that can be managed like a little steam engine. Now\nwe've been rationally managed to hell and not back (and the solution is\nalways more rational management).</p>\n<p>The terrible truth is that traditional social norms are <em>irrational</em> and\n<em>still do</em> exist for a reason in the perennial gale of social evolution.\nSocial change and social progress (note the lack of scare quotes) have\nalways been happening, but only now do we have the naive idea that the\nunits of society (people) have the competence to design and contribute\nto an otherwise unconscious evolution of social memes.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'll give the last word on this issue to Noam Chomsky, who\nsomehow manages to say something clear and admirable on the subject:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Science is a very strange activity. It only works for simple\nproblems. Even in the hard sciences, when you move beyond the simplest\nstructures, it becomes very descriptive. By the time you get to big\nmolecules, for example, you are mostly describing things. The idea\nthat deep scientific analysis tells you something about problems of\nhuman beings and our lives and our inter-relations with one another\nand so on is mostly pretense in my opinion&mdash;self-serving pretense\nwhich is itself a technique of domination and exploitation and should\nbe avoided. Professionals certainly have the responsibility of not\nmaking people believe that they have some special knowledge that\nothers can't attain without special means or special college\neducation or whatever. If things are simple, they should be said\nsimply; if there is something serious to say that is not simple, then,\nfine, that's good and interesting. We can perhaps find deep answers\nto certain questions that do bear directly on issues of human interest\nand concern, but that is rarely true.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"science-communicators\">&quot;'Science' 'Communicators'&quot;</h2>\n<p>One of the worst aspects of all of this is that this understanding of\npop-science encourages people to distrust what they know or can judge of\nthe world in favor of the caricature of the consensus of\ninstitutionalized academics. People have this idea that there are these\nintellectual, peer-reviewed demigods in universities who discover the\nsecrets to the universe and communicate them through their messengers\nstationed at BuzzFeed and the Huffington Post. Betraying their infinite\nwisdom would make you &quot;irrational&quot; or a &quot;fundie.&quot; The reality is\nthat these demigods really just went to graduate school because they\nwere lazy and initiativeless, and even in the abstract, most of their\nreal work has nothing to do with your life whatsoever. It's only the\nmessengers that convince you of that because it stimulates their power\ntrip.</p>\n<p>Science journalists, much like journalists generally, are people too\nincompetent and emotional to work in the private sector, too dumb to be\nacademics (and the standards are abysmally low these days), too full of\nthemselves to work in charity and too bumbling, weak and arrogant to\nwork in a blue collar or manual occupation. Journalism is an attractive\ncareer to many because it demands the least rigor and honor and promises\nthe greatest power and influence.</p>\n<p>Their self-ordained duty is to overwhelm the public with a confusion of\n&quot;studies&quot; that increasingly seem to micromanage a neurotic person's\nlife. &quot;Studies show that&quot; classical music may help infant brain\ngrowth, or that gluten ravages the intestines, or that simply owning\nmore books causes higher scholastic achievement, or that Vitamin C or\nantioxidants or kale or whatever health-food <em>de jour</em> solve all the\nworld's problems.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, the worst part is that we talk about &quot;science&quot;\nas if it's some kind of anthropomophic creature with desires and\nfeelings and a plan for us all. It's a uniquely modern flaw to say\nthings like, &quot;Science tells us that...&quot; &quot;Science is about..&quot;\n&quot;Science is against...&quot; Does this not strike anyone else as creepy?\nThe interpretation of science forced on the public is a scriptural one,\nwhere law to live life by are codified in &quot;peer-reviewed&quot; journals and\ncommunicated by intermediaries. 'Science's' purview is infinite and\nany failure to conform is some congenital failure or reason.</p>", "permanent": false, "language": "en-US", "source_obj__id": 18, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/science-vs-soyence/", "bookmarked": true, "vote": 0}, {"thumbnail": null, "tags": [], "page_rating_visits": 0, "title": "The Fragility of Physics", "page_rating_contents": 0, "age": 0, "date_published": "2020-12-11T00:00:00+00:00", "page_rating_votes": 0, "comments": [], "source": "https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml", "user": null, "page_rating": 0, "description": "<p>Physics has a reputation of being a uniquely &quot;scientific&quot; field.

That is, while in other more terrestrial sciences, the data\nis well-known and the theory is in debate, in physics, the opposite is\narguably true. In astrophysics, quantum mechanics, the study of gravity\nor relativity, this should all be obvious.</p>\n<p>Even without departing the cuddling embrace of mainstream physics, we\ncan actually see this clearly. What is the ultimate fate of the universe\nto be? A continuous expansion of the universe until heat death? Perhaps\ngravity or some other force will pull everything back in a Big Crunch?\nThe correct alternative is a statement of very specific and tendentious\ndata which changes quite a great deal with any kind of new\ninterpretations of what we see.</p>\n<p>It's worth it to remember that for most of man's history, including\nthe initial development of what we nowadays call physics, the &quot;normal\nstate&quot; of the universe was assumed to be the state of affairs we're\nfamiliar with on the surface of the Earth: everything falls down to the\nground and things propelled in space will slow down until they stop.</p>\n<p>But modern physics now looks at the nature of our life on Earth as an\nexception to the general rule of frictionless and continuous movement in\nthe vacuum of space. A valid question to ask is <em>how much more that we\ntake to be normal is a special case of reality?</em> As we encounter more\nand more abberrant data, such as quantum mechanics, we might soon find\nourself unifying seemingly disparate forces in the same was that Newton\nin a novel and seemingly absurd way the fact that objects fall to the\nground with the apparent fact that the Earth orbits the Sun into one new\nconcept: <em>Gravity</em>. Such a unification religates all our universals to a\nspecial case.</p>\n<h3 id=\"does-light-really-go-the-speed-of-light\">Does light really go the speed of light?</h3>\n<p>Physics is fragile because it is like a game of Jenga. Pull out or\nchange one piece and the whole thing is either reordered or simply\ncollapses.</p>\n<p>As an example, say that within several years, we realize that the speed\nof light, for some known or unknown reason, doesn't function with the\nuniversality we assumed. Suppose that there is some kind of interaction\nof light and gravity such that light is faster in some parts of the\nuniverse. The reason isn't important. Or suppose we merely find out\nthat in the past, there has been a systematic principle (similar to the\nHeisenberg Principle) that has miscalibrated all of our measurements of\nlight.</p>\n<p>Even if we have minutely mismeasured, the Jenga piece of light will\nradically alter everthing: our ideas of how old the universe is, our\nrelationships with other planets, the solvency of general relativity,\netc. You might say that there is a &quot;concordance of evidence&quot; that\nattests to our single known speed of light, but another way of putting\nthat is that we have many other things tied into our interpretation of\nlight that will have to change if we realize our models of it are\nflawed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"poverty-of-data\">Poverty of data</h3>\n<p>Especially in the astronomical domain, it's worth remembering exactly\nhow circumstantial our ideas of space are. We sometime speak of the\ntraits of other solar systems' planets as if we've been there. But in\nreality, astrophysicists guess the chemical compositions of foreign\nplanets based on their light frequencies and other fragile data. Any\nsystematic error in observation over those thousands or millions of\nlightyears and we have been counting angels on pinheads the whole time.</p>\n<p>People have the idea that because astrophysicists make extraordinary\nclaims about planets, galaxies and time periods far beyond our mortal\nken that they must have extraordinary evidence for them. That is frankly\nnot the case. We have a piece-meal and jury-rigged set of circumstantial\nreasoning leading us to these claims. Seeing them computerized in full\ncolor in a science documentary doesn't make them more real. It just\nmakes them look more official.</p>\n<h2 id=\"physics-vs-soft-sciences\">Physics vs. &quot;soft sciences&quot;</h2>\n<p>I remember talking to someone over the internet who accused me of having\na low view of institutionalized science and being a dreaded\nepistemological anarchist because one of my degrees is in the &quot;soft\nscience&quot; of linguistics. While I have a lot of bad things to say about\nthe current state of linguistics, as a field, it is substantially more\nadvanced and its findings are substantially more solid than physics. At\nthat, formalizing ideas in math doesn't just make something a better or\na more rigorous science anyway, which is the assumption of many people\nhave.</p>\n<p>While linguistics undergoes theoretical changes every several\ngenerations, the <em>data</em>, or really more importantly <em>the phenomenology</em>\nof linguistics is as secure as ever across all theoretical frameworks.\nThat is, we know how language works. We can see abstract relationships\nbetween morphemes and syntactic structure. Even if we totally rewrite\nour narratives and theories about linguistic basics, there is no debate\nabout the structure of language and how basic data relates to other\ndata. This is absolutely the opposite of physics.</p>\n<p>Physics is pretty solid on earth, and solid when you are running objects\nat each other in a vacuum, but once we broach the territory of\nastrophysics, relativity, gravity and more or less <em>anything else that\nwe as humans lack direct intuition of</em> most of the &quot;facts&quot; of physics\nare theory-internal facts, and will fade away or be rendered obsolete\nwhen the next theoretical fad comes around.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-standard-for-theoretical-frameworks\">My standard for theoretical frameworks</h2>\n<p>I think any serious scholar needs the ability to operate cognitively\nwith multiple different theoretical frameworks in mind.</p>\n<p>For example, (on linguistics) I don't really take Generative Grammar\nvery seriously, in fact, despite it being on of the most well-funded\ndialects of linguistics nowadays, it's pretty inert. Despite that, I\nview it as very important for me to be able to process linguistic\nproblems within Generative Grammar and word explanations within its\nideas. It's nice to be able to say to someone &quot;this alternation is\naccounted for if this DP occupies the spec of CP.&quot; I don't <em>believe</em>\nin CPs or specifiers as being psychologically real, but I can recognize\nthe language as communicative.</p>\n<p><strong>A good theoretical framework is one that can produce facts and\nobservations that can be recognized and explained outside of its\nframework as well.</strong></p>\n<p>That is, a framework should cue us in to finding utterly novel\nobservations and thus a new <em>phenomenology</em>. This goes against the\negocentric motivations of a lot of scientific frameworks whose\npractitioners are trying to edge out &quot;the competition.&quot; Fields that\nspend most of their time trying to formalize previous observations\nwithin their own theoretical language are mostly a waste of time (this\nis Generative Grammar, frankly, although due to historical ignorance,\nmany people in GG do not know they are re-treading steps).</p>\n<p>One of the biggest issues of modern post-war institutionalized science\nis that the funding and peer-review mechanism is self-reinforcing: all\nfields converge to be &quot;unipolar&quot;: only one methodology or framework is\ndeemed &quot;scientific.&quot; This creates a community of &quot;scientists&quot; who\nare more an more incestuous and generally oblivious not just to other\npossibilities of inquiry, but don't even have to be aware of their own\npriors or assumptions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-blinders-of-positivism\">The blinders of positivism</h2>\n<p>As I've interacted with physicists more, I'm often <em>surprised</em> by how\nirrelevant they think even the most basic theoretical awareness is.\nThat's &quot;philosophy&quot; for them. It's not uncommon to hear zingers like\nthese:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&quot;Science isn't about truth, it's about creating models.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;Physics is about fitting equations.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;We don't do philosophy.&quot;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Things like these are said as if they are some kind of statement of\nuniversal and well-consented-to truth, when in reality they are absurd\nZen koans of the positivist religion. This was a loony opinion a hundred\nyears ago and people saying these things now <em>know</em> that they are\nludicrous. They have just become identifying marks of the social club.</p>\n<p>Yep, science is about creating models... models that replicate reality,\ni.e. <em>Truth</em>.</p>\n<p>A scientists who doesn't do philosophy isn't a scientist: he's a\nmeter-reader. A philosopher who doesn't do science isn't a\nphilosopher: he's just a stoner. The attempt to sever these two words\nfrom each other is part of the problem.</p>\n<p>Physicists seem to be particularly touchy on this point. On one hand,\nthey insist that philosophy is &quot;not their thing&quot; and &quot;not related.&quot;\nOn the other hand, they get incredibly angry when <em>anyone else</em> dares to\neither put the methodology of modern physics to any kind of\nphilosophical tests <em>or even</em> to look into philosophical ramifications\nof their work.</p>\n<p>In reality, modern scientists and positivists have their own\nmetaphysics, it is just an <em>implicit</em> one that they advertently or\ninadvertently sneak into their theories. They can only do it because its\nclumsy sterile &quot;materialism&quot; is the background-radiation of the modern\nworld.</p>", "permanent": false, "language": "en-US", "source_obj__id": 18, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/the-fragility-of-physics/", "bookmarked": true, "vote": 0}, {"thumbnail": null, "tags": [], "page_rating_visits": 0, "title": "Why I Use the GPL and Not Cuck Licenses", "page_rating_contents": 0, "age": 0, "date_published": "2020-12-11T00:00:00+00:00", "page_rating_votes": 0, "comments": [], "source": "https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml", "user": null, "page_rating": 0, "description": "<p>Every piece of software I write I license under the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html\">GNU Public License\nVersion 3</a> (GPLv3)\nunless I have forked it from something else.</p>\n<p>The GPLv3 is the premiere <em>copyleft</em> license, meaning that it not\nonly allows users to run, modify and distribute their own versions of\nwhat I write, but it also requires that no one in that chain of\ndevelopment restrict and close-source that software: it and software\nderiving from it must forever remain open, usable and sharable. Richard\nStallman, one of the minds behind the GPL has described it as a &quot;hack&quot;\nof the copyright system because it uses the legal infrastructure of\ncopyright to ensure software is free rather than restricted.</p>\n<p>But occasionally I get asked why I don't use so-called <em>permissive licenses</em> like BSD or MIT. These are free software licenses, but\nthey <em>do not</em> require that forked versions of the code be free and open\nsource software. In other words, you can take something written with a\nBSD or MIT license, put it in the next version of Windows and no one\nwill ever know.

When\nyou really look at it, the similarity is uncanny.</p>\n<p>I understand GPL free software and its ethical vision for software. I\nalso understand that desire for people and businesses to <em>not</em> release\ntheir source code for commercial and monetary benefits. What I don't\nunderstand is simultaneously releasing free code with no requirement\nthat it remain free. It can now be used against you and others&mdash;if you\nhad moral qualms about that, you could've <em>at least</em> made money off of\nit yourself.</p>\n<p>Using a Cuck License <em>especially</em> for &quot;ethical reasons&quot; or &quot;because I\nlike open source software&quot; is beyond absurd. You're simply writing\ncode and effectively abandoning the privileges of intellectual property\nwhile allowing any large corporation to come and close-source and\nmonetize your software and sell it back to you without any other\nobligations. You have also abandoned your ability to ever complain about\nIBM, Microsoft, Apple or any other tech giant because <strong>you are\nliterally writing their proprietary software</strong>. These companies even\nsometimes take very simple code from minor projects and use it to save a\nbuck and a little effort.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"resright\"><a href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/timnolet.png\"><img src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/timnolet.png\" title=\"'Noooo!

It has the pretense of a license, but\nfor no real function. I suppose depending on which you use, you at least\nget your name on the license, but I hardly think that that's how\ninternet fame and glory is actually distributed anyway. As far as I'm\nconcerned <strong>using a Cuck License is worse for user freedom than just\nreleasing it in the public domain</strong>. This is because at least public\ndomain software can be taken and later additions can be protected by the\nGPL. The legal case for doing that with a Cuck License is not so clear.</p>\n<h3 id=\"no-whiners\">No whiners!</h3>\n<p>The funniest thing is when Cuck Licensers <em>complain</em> that people are\nabiding by their licenses. They will <em>complain</em> that people took their\ncode and made money off of it. They will <em>complain</em> when they don't get\nsome social credit they feel like they deserve when their code is used\nin a project. They will <em>complain</em> if people fork their project and it\nbecomes more popular than the original. They will <em>complain</em> when some\ntech giant takes their code and makes spyware out of it.</p>\n<p>If they were serious about stopping any of this, <em>they easily could've\nby licensing their project as anything other than a code giveaway</em>. If\nyou want praise for some contribution, put it in the license. If you\ndon't want your software used for proprietary software, use the GPLv3.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-cuck-licenser-gets-what-he-deserves-and-we-all-pay-the-price\">A Cuck Licenser gets what he deserves (and we all pay the price).</h2>\n<p>One of the funniest and saddest horror stories of Cuck Licenses I can\nthink of is Andrew Tanenbaum, who released MINIX, an operating system,\nunder a BSD license. Intel silently took this software (thanks to its\nlicense) and unbeknownst to him, used it for their Intel Management\nEngine, <strong>making it the OS of the spyware microprocessor/backdoor now\nrunning in all Intel CPUs</strong>. We all have a permanent NSA backdoor\nbecause of the Intel Management Engine&mdash;all made possibly by Cuck\nLicense cuckery.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/intel/\">Only many, many years later was this even revealed to\nTanenbaum.</a> Read that blog post of his\nas he slowly externalizes his mixed feelings, tinged with guilt. After\nall, on the &quot;bright&quot; side, he says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;I guess that makes MINIX the most widely used computer operating\nsystem in the world, even more than Windows, Linux, or MacOS.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wow, what a proud achievement. But regardless, Tanenbaum already feels\nsome regret about the fact that his permissive license allowed Intel to\nwithhold this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;This was a complete surprise. I don't mind, of course, and was not\nexpecting any kind of payment since that is not required. There isn't\neven any suggestion in the license that it would be appreciated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The\nonly thing that would have been nice is that after the project had\nbeen finished and the chip deployed, that someone from Intel would\nhave told me, just as a courtesy, that MINIX was now probably the most\nwidely used operating system in the world on x86 computers. That\ncertainly wasn't required in any way, but I think it would have been\npolite to give me a heads up, that's all.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<figure class=\"resright\"><img src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/cia.png\" title=\"A glow-in-the-dark CIA gamer\" /></figure>\n\n<p>You can feel the regret. <strong>With Cuck Licenses, you get the worst of two\nworlds:</strong> You get no credit for your work, nor money for licensing fees\nlike other proprietary software and your software will be used to\nviolate your and other users' privacy when it is used in closed-source\nenvironments. Oh, no... copes incoming:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Many people (including me) <strong>don't like the idea of an all-powerful\nmanagement engine in there at all</strong> (since it is a possible security\nhole and a dangerous idea in the first place), but that is Intel's\nbusiness decision and a separate issue from the code it runs. A\ncompany as big as Intel could obviously write its own OS if it had\nto.&quot; <em>emphasis added</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If Tanenbaum had released MINIX under the GPL, we <em>wouldn't be</em> at the\nmercy of Intel's business decision. They would've had to release the\nsource code for the microprocessor, keeping user privacy ensured and\nirradicating the permanent spyware liability all computers have\nnowadays.</p>\n<p>If they wouldn't want to do that, they'd have to just write an\noperating system themselves. Tanenbaum is right, they obviously\n<em>could've</em> taken the time and money to write an OS themselves if they\nhad to, but they <em>didn't have to</em>, <strong>because a BSD license cuck wrote\nit for them</strong>. Thanks a lot, sucker! Now our computers are being\nmonitored at a lower start-up cost and we have you to thank. It\nwould've been a lot <em>more</em> respectable to <em>not</em> use a permissive\nlicense and instead license it proprietarily if he has no moral issues\nwith proprietary software: he could've <em>at least</em> gotten Intel to pay\nhim to use his operating system. Heck, if he had used the GPL and if\nthey took it anyway, he could become an insta-millionaire by suing them\nright now.</p>\n<p>The moral of the story is perhaps lost on Tanenbaum, who finishes up his\nblog post with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;If nothing else, this bit of news reaffirms my view that the\nBerkeley license provides the maximum amount of freedom to potential\nusers.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Maximum amount of freedom to potential users&quot; is somehow\nmass-surveilance of every computer user thanks to the BSD license.\nThanks for your contribution to &quot;freedom.&quot;</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-freedom-that-cuck-licenses-preserve\">The Freedom that Cuck Licenses &quot;preserve&quot;</h2>\n<p>&quot;Freedom&quot; is an incoherent buzzword if you don't define it. There are\nsome people who might argue that the fact that they can't kill and\nsteal freely is a violation of their &quot;freedom.&quot; That's very true in\nsome sense.</p>\n<p>In the same way, the GPL (unlike Cuck Licenses) &quot;violates&quot; the freedom\nof all people to close-source code and hide it from the public and (in\neffect) do annoying or privacy-violating things with it.</p>\n<p>The goal of the Free Software Movement, defended by copyleft licenses\nlike the GPL is for all software writers and users to live in an\nenvironment of publicly auditable, editable and exchangable code. The\ngoals of the Open Source movement have a similar goal, albeit often\nguided by practical considerations.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"resright\"><img alt=\"Cuck-licensers write proprietary software for free.\" src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/janny.jpg\" /><figcaption>He does it for free.</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Cuck Licenses, however, undermine those goals. They will <em>say</em> that they\nmaximize freedom by placing no requirement on those who distribute When\nyou release any code under a Cuck License, you are simply writing free\ncommercial code for corporations that will inevitably use it against\nyou. You might as well just <em>actually get a job with them</em> so you can\nget paid for what you do instead of just getting cucked. When you\nrelease code under the GPL, you write free software that benefits other\npeople who write free software.</p>\n<p>The Free Software Foundation and the GPL people have correctly realized\nthat just being &quot;permissive&quot; with licenses is unworkable in the\ncurrent environment. The legal infrastructure incentivizes and defends\nproprietary software and gives it a systematic financial advantage. The\nGPL is a viral antidote to that. Obviously if all software were free and\nno laws protected &quot;intellectual property&quot; in publicly obtainable\nsoftware, <em>everything</em> would be &quot;permissively licensed.&quot; We don't\nlive in that world. The GPL and other &quot;copyleft&quot; licenses are ways of\nundermining and disincentivizing and making impossible the\nclose-sourcing of software. Not using the GPL and using a cuck license\nis just the same as writing proprietary because <em>you literally are</em>\nbecause all of your software can be snatched up and proprietarily\nlicensed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bbuut-the-gpl-isnt-enforceable\">&ldquo;B...buut the GPL isn't enforceable!&rdquo;</h2>\n<p>I've heard some people pass around the idea that somehow the GPL is\nunenforceable. After all, if you have close source software, how can\nanyone really tell what's going on? In some cases, that might be true\nif you have perfect op-sec. That wouldn't be the case for the Intel\nManagement Engine above, and that wouldn't be the case for Windows XP,\nwhose source code recently leaked.</p>\n<p>I have known people in industry writing proprietary software and\nworrying about the GPL is real. The &quot;virus&quot; of GPL taking over\neverything and making it free is something people have to take heed of.\nI'm sure there is some level of GPL-violation going on in some places\nat least, just because lifting simple routines or copy-and-pasting some\nthings from GPL with significant enough changes could go unseen even if\nleaked, but integrating larger GPL programs would be nearly an\nimpossibility.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, though, what does it matter? What is a totally\nunenforced GPL? It's just a Cuck License&mdash;Isn't that what license\ncucks want? So why should they care? At their very best, BSD and MIT\nlicenses are only what GPL might be at its very worst.</p>\n<p>The GPL is a permanent liability for any company that crosses it. Some\ncompanies might be so bold to lift GPL code and hide it, but there is\nalways a risk and a worry that prevents its general violation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"addendum\">Addendum</h2>\n<h3 id=\"are-copyleft-licenses-always-best-even-for-freedom\">Are copyleft licenses always best even for freedom?</h3>\n<p>No!</p>\n<p>Here's a question I got about this article that I'll reproduce here\nbecause it touches on something good.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>[personal details omitted for anonymity]\n\nHowever, I read your article, and I can see your point. I have an idea for an\nOperating System and due to your arguments, I would definitely license that\nunder the GPL, as well as any new programs I write. I might even change most or\nall of my current programs to GPL, with the exception of that bc, which needs\nto remain BSD since it is default in FreeBSD now.\n\nThat said, I have a library I am working on, and my experience is that\nlibraries under the GPL do not get used, unless a commercial license is offered\nas well, and often, not even then. You can see this with glibc, which has a\nspecial linking exception and the fact that the LGPL is fairly popular for\nlibraries.\n\nFirst question: what is your opinion on the linking exception and the LGPL? Are\nthey Cuck Licenses? I mean, they do require that the library and any\nmodifications be put under the LGPL, which means that the library remains libre\nsoftware. However, they can also be put into proprietary code, which is the\nentire reason you call MIT and BSD licenses Cuck Licenses.\n\nBasically, it seems as though you are correct when it comes to licensing\nprograms themselves. But it gets murkier when talking about libraries.\n\n[other personal details omitted]\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was my response to this email explaining this finer point.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>Yeah. There are sometimes times when it is tactically better to license\nthings under a permissive license if for institutional reasons:\nmass-adoption is required and companies and such might be unnerved by\nthe GPL. Libraries might often be like that. So it's not necessarily a\npurity-spiralling point.\n\nRMS actually advised that ogg/vorbis should use a cuck license to\nmaximize adoption (it originally used the LGPL, but switched to BSD):\n\nhttps://lwn.net/2001/0301/a/rms-ov-license.php3\n\nIt's thanks to this that it has now become a usable and wide-spread\nformat, used now on nearly every proprietary web service because of its\nsmall-size, good fidelity and general superiority.\n\nSo yeah, if you're writing a standalone program, I'd use the GPL, but I\nwould choose licenses ultimately in terms of which would maximize the\npossibilities for users of using free-software. In some circumstances,\nthat means using a cuck license. Same is true of the LGPL. I think\nGNU/FSF recommend LGPL only to be used when it is competing with a\nproprietary library, and if that's usually what you are writing, you\nmight end up writing a lot in the LGPL.\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>", "permanent": false, "language": "en-US", "source_obj__id": 18, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/why-i-use-the-gpl-and-not-cuck-licenses/", "bookmarked": true, "vote": 0}, {"thumbnail": null, "tags": ["surveillance bill", "big brother", "surveillance", "australia", "privacy"], "page_rating_visits": 0, "title": "\u2018No one\u2019s safe under these laws\u2019: Surveillance Bill could target activists and downloaders", "page_rating_contents": 0, "age": 0, "date_published": "2020-12-10T13:10:45+00:00", "page_rating_votes": 0, "comments": [], "source": "thenewdaily.com.au", "user": null, "page_rating": 0, "description": "", "permanent": false, "language": "en-US", "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "link": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/life/tech/2020/12/10/dutton-surveillance-bill-australia/", "bookmarked": true, "vote": 60.0}, {"thumbnail": null, "tags": ["surveillance", "corporatocracy", "big brother", "biometric"], "page_rating_visits": 0, "title": "Sci-fi surveillance: Europe's secretive push into biometric technology", "page_rating_contents": 0, "age": 0, "date_published": "2020-12-10T13:00:02+00:00", "page_rating_votes": 0, "comments": [], "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "user": "rumpel", "page_rating": 0, "description": "<p>EU science funding is being spent on developing new tools for policing and security.

A common drug Howard and other pharmacies sell is called Metformin. The drug itself only costs Jacobson $1.61. If the patient paid with cash out-of-pocket for the drug, Jacobson would sell it to them for $4.00, earning him a respectable $2.39 in profit. The patient used their insurance plan where the patient had to pay $10.84 for the drug instead of $4. Jacobson the pharmacist ends up making only $1.93 in profit. Higher cost for the patient, lower profit for the pharmacy. That whopping $8.91 goes to the insurance company and their middlemen. \n\nManufacturers sell their products to retailers. Consumers buy those products from the retailers at a higher price. That way the retailers make some profit to keep for themselves, and they get to buy more products from the manufacturers. The big pharma supply chain is a lot more complicated. \n\nBig Pharma companies spend billions to develop drugs and to try to get them to pass the FDA. This is the first reason why drugs can get so expensive. They are doing all the work, so it\u2019s a little bit more understandable.\n\nWholesalers transport the drugs and sell them to the pharmacies. The patient gets prescribed medication from their doctor and goes to the pharmacy to get their meds. Most patients have health insurance to save money on big medical expenses. They use their insurance to pay for prescription meds. For the remainder of the costs, the pharmacy sends a bill to the patient\u2019s insurance company. The patient feels as if they're getting their money\u2019s worth from their insurance. \n\nInsurance companies are in the business of making money, not giving away free charity. Patients pay their monthly bill for insurance, and when medical bills arise, the patient would pay the entire bill themselves, and the insurance companies would just sit back and collect that monthly bill. The lower the copay they pay, the more you have to fork up to cover their costs and the less profit you make. \n\nDrug companies pay a commission back to the insurance company. We call these \u201crebates\u201d. And the people responsible for negotiating how big of a rebate, the insurance companies get falls onto the broker.\n\nBrokers are those middlemen that negotiate with the drug makers to get as much money back for the insurance companies as possible.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to blame drug companies, insurance companies and their \u201cPharmacy Benefit Managers,\u201d. Everyone gets stuck with a higher bill. Mix in the other incentives of drug companies, insurance companies, middlemen and prices for things like big pharma drugs and everything else - skyrocket!\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.

You watch porn, masturbate, have sex as much as you can and\nany consequences of any of this are just facts of life which you view as\neither out of your control or worth the suffering. You might not use\ndrugs because you are worried of the hedonistic damage it can cause, but\nyou're at least &ldquo;chill&rdquo; with people who do. At a basic level, modern\nsociety is hedonistic because it more or less openly holds as highest\nmoral value what can stimulate people the most. You know this is the\ncase because anyone who <em>condemns</em> hedonistic behavior will immediately\nbe judged as &ldquo;judgemental.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Asceticism is supposed to be the &ldquo;smart&rdquo; alternative.</strong> Asceticism is\nrejecting pleasure, normal life and anything else enjoyable in the world\nas morally inferior to some higher non-physical ideal. Buddhism, which\nrejects the physical world, has become a popular meme philosophy in the\nWest and is highly acetic. Vegans are acetic: they abandon basic life\nfor their own principles and intense vegans will eventually start\ntalking about &quot;transcending&quot; and &quot;vibrations&quot; and non-sense. Look at\nthe anti-global warming movements and they fall perfectly, almost\nneurotically into this category. Asceticism come in many forms nowadays,\nbut it is always a reaction to the indulgences of hedonism.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-poetic-worldview\">The Poetic Worldview</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://renaissanceastrology.com/hermestrismegistus.html\"></a></p>\n\n<figure class=\"resright\"><img src=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/hermes.png\" /><figcaption>Hermes Trismegistus, author of the Hermetic Corpus</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>The Poetic Worldview is the solution. Don't worry, it has nothing to do\nwith poetry.</p>\n<p>The Greek word that <em>poetry/poetic</em> comes from actually is just a\ngeneric word for <em>make, create, produce</em>. The word &quot;poetry&quot; originally\njust meant something like &quot;creative output.&quot;</p>\n<p>This view is tied into early Platonism and monotheism. The physical\nuniverse is a creation or manifestation or &quot;the One&quot; or &quot;the Source&quot;\nor really [God]{.dfn}. God is the ultimate creator, and an individual is\n<strong>good</strong> insofar as [he reflects this creative tendency of God]{.dfn}.\nWe see it expounded in the Hermetic Corpus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The other name of God is Father, again because He is the\nthat-which-maketh-all. The part of father is to make.&rdquo; <a href=\"http://www.gnosis.org/library/grs-mead/TGH-v2/th205.html\">To\nAsclepius</a>\n(17), from the <a href=\"http://www.gnosis.org/library/hermet.htm\">Hermetic\nCorpus</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the Poetic Worldview, <strong>the highest moral goal is creation</strong>. That\ncan be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>affecting the world,</li>\n<li>improving what is around you,</li>\n<li>having children,</li>\n<li>making money not to spend it on pleasures, but to make something new\nand great with it,</li>\n<li>writing or making something useful or edifying for others,</li>\n<li>clearing up misconceptions that get in other people's way in\naccomplishing these things.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From the Poetic worldview, hedonism is evil because it is expending\notherwise creative energy into nothing of consequence. Racking up\nvideo-game achievements that no one will ever know or care of but you,\nwatching pornography, pursuing fleeting relationships, impulsively\nwasting time browsing the internet and fiddling with social media.</p>\n<p>This passive and impulsive pleasure-seeking reduces someone's ability\nto live as intended, instead, they are prisoners to their lusts and\nconveniences:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;But whatsoever human souls have not the Mind as pilot, they share in\nthe same fate as souls of lives irrational. For [Mind] becomes\nco-worker with them, giving full play to the desires towards which\n[such souls] are borne,&mdash;[desires] that from the rush of lust\nstrain after the irrational; [so that such human souls,] just like\nirrational animals, cease not irrationally to rage and lust, nor ever\nare they satiate of ills. For passions and irrational desires are ills\nexceeding great; and over these God hath set up the Mind to play the\npart of judge and executioner.&rdquo; <a href=\"http://www.gnosis.org/library/grs-mead/TGH-v2/th225.html\">About the Common\nMind</a> (4),\nfrom the <a href=\"http://www.gnosis.org/library/hermet.htm\">Hermetic Corpus</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hedonism is additionally harmful because <em>it isn't even hedonistic</em>.\nIt's clumsy and self-destructive. Spend your life from ages 16-23\nplaying videogames, masturbating and smoking weed and you have destroyed\nyour capacity to enjoy life, sex and have normal interactions with\nnormal people. Your capacity for enjoyment ends and you fall into\nasceticism as a cope.</p>\n<p><strong>Asceticism is just as evil</strong> because it sees this issue with the\nhedonistic lifestyle and tosses up its hands in surrender. It\ninternalizes the lie that wasteful and sinful living is somehow\nobviously funner&mdash;when they see they aren't actually having fun, they\nthrow the whole world away.</p>\n<p><strong>Most ascetics are liars anyway.</strong> They pretend to reject pleasure and\nworldly things, but they often just seek it in perverted or\nunconventional ways. There are men who call themselves MGTOW (Men going\ntheir own way) who &quot;swear off&quot; women. In reality, most of them are\njust desperate porn-addicted men who just can't get the girl they want.</p>\n<p>Contrary to all of this, having a Poetic view proposes that the more\nmoral and also most enjoyable life is one where one is constantly\ncreating something new out of what he is given. In Hermetic thinking\n(and, well, Christian thinking) man must hold God as the idea to\nemulate. Since God's principle feat is creation from nothing, our goal\nis to celebrate that creation by making something new and productive\nfrom the raw materials we have.</p>\n<p>Asceticism views the material world <em>as a mistake or illusion</em> which\nleads people to reject life itself. The Poetic view is that the physical\nworld is a <strong>reflection of its spiritual state</strong>, and what you do in the\nphysical world reflects your spiritual stature.</p>\n<p>The Poetic view is <em>somewhat</em> similar to Nietzsche's <em>Will to Power</em>,\nwhich was an attempt to unite both human and material\nsciences under the idea that the ideal is maximizing one's output on\nthe external world. Will to Power is a little more morally ambivalent\nthough; it can include destruction, while Poeticism merely values\ncreative power.</p>\n<h2 id=\"distractions-are-literally-evil\">Distractions are literally evil.</h2>\n<p>This is why <em>I highly condemn wasteful activities like videogames and pornography and social media.</em> They are principally habits that\ndivert your natural energies into something absolutely sterile. <strong>Many\npeople ask me &ldquo;What can I do to be more productive?&rdquo;</strong> and I have to say\nthat the most important thing is to <strong>remove inert distractions and\nhabits</strong>.</p>\n<p>Due to bureaucratic workplaces and bureaucratic education, there are\nmany modern people who <em>just don't know what it means to be\nproductive</em>. Most of their lives might be someone trying to fill their\nday with busywork. Since the normal enjoyable ritual of creative output\nis unknown to them, this causes a kind of aimlessness and the <a href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/files/unabomber.pdf\">feelings\nof inferiority</a> that comes with that.</p>\n<p>But in truth, you live at <strong>an ideal period</strong> in that you can have a\nhighly impactful and ergo <em>poetic</em> effect on the world using internet\ntechnology and the higher material standard of living. The only trick is\nto sidestep the distractions of hedonism that turns you into a passive\nconsumer and the apathy of asceticism.</p>", "permanent": false, "language": "en-US", "source_obj__id": 18,

Or as I put it\nthere, &quot;You will need politics less than you think.&quot;</p>\n<p>That is to say that if you live in a city where your every action is\nwatched, if you use proprietary software and communicate only via social\nmedia services, if you have no marketable skills because you have some\ninert degree and questionably productive and definitely replaceable job\nand a large company, you need politics quite a great deal.</p>\n<p>Your entire existence in the system is based on being a good boy within\nthe established boundaries of what is deemed by the mass media to be\nsocio-politically appropriate. <em>Maybe</em> you've gone into debt, but you\n<em>definitely</em> rely the whole &quot;system&quot; for all the basics. If you don't\nthink you do, just ask yourself whether your life has changed for the\nbetter after the Coronachan Panic of 2020.</p>\n<p>What's the alternative? Well, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRVmfx4EWI0\">boomer rants viewers might see some of\nthis coming</a>...</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is that both the daily ins-and-outs of politics\nand the overarching trends of politics matter very little the more\nindependent your are of the system. Earlier, I always mumbled about how\nconservaboomers seemed a little too apathetic about the cultural changes\nbeing forced on them. This social engineering still is the most serious\nproblem in all technologically-complex mass-media societies, but I must\nadmit for people who choose personal independence and independence for\ntheir families and local communities, it is much less of a problem.</p>\n<p>When I was plugged into the system, minorly red-pilled and generally\npeeved because I actually paid attention to the media as something other\nthan to laugh at, I found the idea of Political &quot;Exit&quot; pretty cucky.\nHow much sense does it make to leave the &quot;political process&quot;\naltogether? Sounds like giving up.</p>\n<p>It sounds like giving up because the &quot;political process&quot; is something\ninternal to the media system at large. That's why even when the\npolitical process does something the media doesn't like (like electing\nthe Orange Boomer, for example), its actions are immediately rendered\ninert by fakery.</p>\n<p>The actual solution is creating and participating in organic society,\nwhich still very much exists outside the purview of the media and NGOs\nand the like. People still need plumbers. No one is going to fire a\nplumber because he says trannies are mentally ill men in\ndresses&mdash;otherwise there'd be no plumbers. Or electricians, or\nbuilders or anyone who actually does anything productive. It'd just be\nHR, journalists and professors left... and some open source developers\nwho write more codes of conducts than they do software. Do you think\nthey'll be able to feed you?</p>\n<p>Exiting the system is actually the opposite of surrender. Why would you\nthink the solution is something like voting or even &quot;owning the libs&quot;\nor something publicly advertised as a solution? The actual solution is\nbuilding an alternative. Or maybe <em>rebuilding</em> the alternative.</p>\n<p>Do you really want to make your boss rich if you think he'd turn around\nand betray you because of a media witchhunt? It's better for you to be\ndoxxed and fired now rather than wait 20 years for it, getting more\nensconced in the insanity. Start becoming more independent now.</p>\n<p>A lot of people LARP about what they're going to do when they take over\n&quot;the system&quot; by revolution. Revolution, the idea of abrupt enforced\nchange, however, is fundamentally their idea and if you buy it, you're\ngoing to keep running your head into a wall.</p>\n<p>Being independent, living out of the city and the Matrix, however, is\nsimultaneously like transporting yourself back in time to when things\nwere saner, but at the same time, transporting yourself into the future\nwhere &quot;the system&quot; has already collapsed and we're already\nrebuilding. Be a part of it now rather than later.</p>", "permanent": false, "language": "en-US", "source_obj__id": 18, "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "link": "https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/politics-matters-most-to-slaves/", "bookmarked": true, "vote": 0}, {"thumbnail": null, "tags": ["lockdown", "covid"], "page_rating_visits": 0, "title": "U.S. Field Hospitals Stand Down, Most Without Treating Any COVID-19 Patients", "page_rating_contents": 0, "age": 0, "date_published": "2020-05-07T21:04:58+00:00", "page_rating_votes": 0, "comments": [], "source": "https://www.npr.org", "user": "rumpel", "page_rating": 0, "description": "U.S. Field Hospitals Stand Down, Most Without Treating Any COVID-19 Patients", "permanent": false, "language": "en", "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "link": "https://www.npr.org/2020/05/07/851712311/u-s-field-hospitals-stand-down-most-without-treating-any-covid-19-patients?t=1609407487809", "bookmarked": true, "vote": 70.0}, {"thumbnail": null, "tags": ["wuhan", "anthony fauci", "covid", "lab leak"], "page_rating_visits": 0, "title": "Anthony Fauci just crushed Donald Trump's theory on the origins of the coronavirus | CNN Politics", "page_rating_contents": 0, "age": 0, "date_published": "2020-05-05T14:18:16+00:00", "page_rating_votes": 0, "comments": [], "source": "https://edition.cnn.com", "user": "rumpel", "page_rating": 0, "description": "Anthony Fauci just crushed Donald Trump's theory on the origins of the coronavirus | CNN Politics", "permanent": false, "language": "en", "dead": false, "artist": null, "album": null, "link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/05/politics/fauci-trump-coronavirus-wuhan-lab/index.html", "bookmarked": true, "vote": 0}, {"thumbnail": null, "tags": ["lab leak", "covid", "wuhan"], "page_rating_visits": 0, "title": "Trump claims to have evidence coronavirus started in Chinese lab but offers no details", "page_rating_contents": 0, "age": 0, "date_published": "2020-05-01T03:51:23+00:00", "page_rating_votes": 0, "comments": [], "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "user": "rumpel", "page_rating": 0, "description": "<p>President touts unsubstantiated theory shortly after director of national intelligence rejects it</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">C</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">oronavirus \u2013 latest global updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Donald Trump claims to have seen evidence to substantiate the unproven theory that the coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite US intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that the virus was \u201cnot manmade or genetically modified\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to see where it comes from,\u201d Trump said at a White House event on Thursday. \u201cWe have people looking at it very, very strongly.
